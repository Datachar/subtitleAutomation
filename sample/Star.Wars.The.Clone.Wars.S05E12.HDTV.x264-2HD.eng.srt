But I thought
maybe you could--

159
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:56,039
could you tell me, how did I get here?

to be right the first time.

if the Jedi Council
thought one of you droids

were better prepared
to lead this mission,

177
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,939
then why did they put me in charge?

178

'Cause you were the only one
who could fit inside Beezee.

179

No, it is because my power
of deduction told me

180
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:03,852
that if there
are Separatist droids on Abafar,

181
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:06,589
then there must be a landing zone nearby

182
00:09:06,623 --> 00:09:10,426
where there will be no doubt
a shuttle to take us home.

00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,797
That, Corporal, is why I am in charge.

184
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:21,037
Now, we are going
to waltz down there, undetected,

185
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:23,039
just like we did on the dreadnought,

186
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:26,442
and commandeer that shuttle
without incident.

187
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:28,811
[droids warbling]

188
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:30,279
The 'mechs have a point, Colonel.

189
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:31,914
After what we did on the dreadnought,

190
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:35,050
those battle droids probably
have our identities scanned.

191
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:37,886
We will have to fight our way
onto the shuttle this time.

192
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,555
Hmm, you droids may have a point.

193
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:42,290
But there's no way in Malachor

194
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:45,159
that I'm going to lead
this pitiful squad

195
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:47,761
on an assault of that landing zone.

196
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,363
What is the plan now, Colonel?

197
00:09:49,397 --> 00:09:53,433
We're going to wait
until our clone gets off work,

198
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:57,471
then enlist his help,
whether he wants to or not.

199
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,037
[R2-D2 clicks]

200
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:51,691
Captain Rex reporting for duty.

201
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,125
Agh! What?

202
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,099
I...

203
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,667
I don't understand.

204
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:04,935
That's me?

205
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,037
No, that's Captain Rex.

206
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:09,706
He's a clone in the Republic Army,

207
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:11,875
just like you, Gregor.

208
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:15,578
I can't believe it.

209
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:17,213
Okay, slow down.
Slow down.

210
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:21,785
So you're telling me that there
are more of these clones?

211
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:24,721
Millions.
A whole army's worth.

212
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:26,456
Uh-huh.

213
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,793
And they all look exactly like me?

214
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:33,296
No, those clones are warriors,

215
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,332
professional soldiers
created by the Republic,

216
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:39,602
trained to fight, and die if necessary,

217
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:42,038
in our war against the Separatists.

218
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:43,406
They're not dishwashers

some vermin-infested hovel.

[droids bleeping]

221
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:51,748
Look, I'm lucky to live in this place.

222
00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:54,784
Mr. Borkus says my salary
doesn't even cover the rent,

223
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:56,685
so he pays the difference for me.

224
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,387
Don't you get it, Gregor?

225
00:11:58,422 --> 00:11:59,889
You're his slave.

226
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:02,091
We need to figure out
who you really are,

227
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,693
how you got here.

228
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:06,796
Are you sure
you don't remember anything?

229
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:12,903
Well, all I remember is
waking up on a transport.

230
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:15,105
Somehow we crashed on Abafar.

231
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:19,376
And, well, Mr. Borkus says
I have amnesia.

232
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:20,643
Hmm.

233
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:24,180
Every clone has an
identifying code on their wrist.

234
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:26,849
Your military records
will be in the database.

235
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:28,284
Scan him, Artoo.

00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:29,719
[R2-D2 chirps]

237
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:37,462
Impressive.

238
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:43,168
Gregor, your designation
is CC-5576-39.

239
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:47,706
You were a captain
and part of an elite squad.

240

A clone commando.

missing in action during

244
00:12:56,283 --> 00:12:58,050
the Battle of Sarrish.

245
00:12:58,085 --> 00:12:59,385
[all beep and groan]

246
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:01,854
Sarrish?

247
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,856
Sarrish.

248
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,958
Wait.

249
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:08,193
What was the Battle of Sarrish?

250
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:12,097
It was one of the Republic's
most devastating losses.

251
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:14,466
[sighs] Sarrish.

252
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,135
Yes.

253
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,137
Yes, I remember now.

254
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:20,606
So many soldiers were dying.

255
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,010
Dodo you remember
how you escaped Sarrish?

256
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,113
No.

257
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:31,418
I just remember seeing all those bodies.

258
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:33,920
Bodies everywhere.

259
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:35,822
I knew I had to get help.

260
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:39,026
But that's where the memory stops.

261
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:40,361
Well, soldier,

262
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:43,664
there's nothing you can do
about that battle now,

263
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,799
but you can help us.

Our mission depends on it.

Uh, Colonel, Gregor said
to give him five minutes,

267
00:13:58,247 --> 00:13:59,948
but it has been six.

268
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:02,251
What if he does not accept
your offer to join us?

269
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:03,753
Then I'll go back in there

270
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:06,456
and personally
knock some sense into him.

271
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,457
That won't be necessary.

272
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:08,658

00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:12,028
I figured
at least looking like a soldier

275
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:14,130
might bring back some more memories,

276
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:16,332
until we recover my equipment anyway.

277
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:18,535
I overheard you guys talking.

278
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:20,803
I think I know where my armor is.

Let's go check out the diner.

280
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:34,284
Step it up, soldiers.
This isn't a party.

281
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:36,252
We do not have all night.

282
00:14:39,523 --> 00:14:41,157

284
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:53,034
All this time you knew who I was
and didn't tell me.

285
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:54,035
Why?

286
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,205

from your crash.

Your life is mine, Gregor.

290
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,584
You didn't save me.

291
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:09,619
You turned me into a slave.

292
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:12,122
I've worked in this dump
taking orders from you

293
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:14,057
when I could have been fighting
for the Republic.

294
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:15,659
I want my life back.

00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:18,028
You want your freedom, Gregor?

296

Take your gun from me.

not after your Jedi cruiser blows up.

What are you talking about?

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,661
Why do you think the
Separatists bother coming here?

325
00:16:23,695 --> 00:16:25,663
They are mining our Rhydonium

326
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:28,933
to load on the shuttle
and destroy your ride home.

327
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:33,170
You will see.

There.

was actually telling
the truth...for once.

from blowing up that cruiser.

and clear the way, Colonel.

00:18:58,107 --> 00:18:59,074
[explosion]

366
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:00,675
Just keep moving.

367
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:01,943
It is all under control.

368
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:12,586
I'm beginning to remember
how much I hate these guys.

369
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:18,826
Hey, I don't recognize those astromechs.

370
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,961
Blast them!

371
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,363
They are on to us.

372
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:25,565
[explosion]

373
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,333
Colonel, can you hear me?

374
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:29,502
Save yourselves!

375
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,337
Okay.
Whoa!

376
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,338
Agh!

377
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,940
Whoa-oh-oh.

378
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,942
[blasters firing]

379
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,451
Did everybody make it?

380
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:49,987
No, Beezee and the colonel
are still out there.

381
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:52,322
Get the shuttle ready to roll.

382
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,059
[groans]

383
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,695
Agh!

384
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:01,698
Colonel, you all right?

385
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,267
I'll never make it back alive.

386
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:05,703
Yes, you will, sir.

387
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,237
This is what I was born to do.

388
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,006
Now, go before it's too late.

389
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,042
[blasters firing]

390
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:19,983
[explosion]

391
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:27,790
[groans]

392
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:33,695
It's been an honor
serving with you, Colonel.

393
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:36,631
[R2-D2 whistles]

394
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:37,866
Artoo's right.

395
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,068
We can swing back around
and pick you up.

396
00:20:40,103 --> 00:20:42,771
Don't worry about me.

397
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:44,706
You made me remember who I am.

398
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,541
I'll make my way home.
I promise.

399
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:47,709
Now go!

400
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,580
[blasters firing]

401
00:20:51,614 --> 00:20:53,115
Where is Gregor?

402
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:55,116
Where is Gregor?

403
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:57,986
He's doing what a soldier does:

404
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,623
sacrificing himself
for the lives of others.

405
00:21:01,657 --> 00:21:04,393
[choral music]

406
00:21:24,748 --> 00:21:28,118
You will be remembered, Captain Gregor.

407
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:31,989
We will take your heroic story
back to the Republic,

408
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:35,060
and we will watch for your return.

409
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,029
