You're married.
What if I wasn't?

What you're doing,
it only ends one way.

I wasn't the only senior

Not early, which would mean
it went badly,

it went great.

Okay, you caught me.
I don't even eat the bananas.

00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:14,131
Oh, they're nothing.
It's a nuisance.

179
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,333
Trent Devon's worried
about them.

180
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:19,303
Okay, well, all it is
is another form to fill out.

181
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:20,571
So if that's what you're worried
about, it's fine.

182
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,339
What I'm worried about
is the fact

183
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:23,528
that I
could've told him that

184
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:24,615
had you been
at the meeting

185
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,043
this morning at 8:00.

186
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,232
What?
I checked the schedule.

187
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,446
There was nothing on it
for this morning.

188
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,614
It happened spontaneously,
as things do.

189
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,882
And I was there.

190
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,617
You were not there.

Did you not hear me

193
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:37,788
when I told you to get
your shit together?

194
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,290
No, I did hear you,
and I did

195
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,758
get my shit together,
by the way.

196
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,426
That's why I'm late
this morning.

197
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:44,261
Deciding to be late
to get your shit together

198
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,063
is not getting
your shit together.

199
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:47,364
Get it
through your head.

200
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:48,599
We just went
through a civil war,

201
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,600
and the world knows it.

202
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:50,701
We're weak.

Okay, Harvey,
I'm sorry,

206
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:56,294
but you need
to ease up here.

207

[Shouts]
Ease up?

208
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,477
You're telling me
to ease up

209
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,811
when our clients
are leaving?

210
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,347
That's right,
Trent Devon might leave.

211
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:04,715

not to screw me.

If I tell you
you did that,

215

I don't want to hear
that you didn't.

216
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,357
I should've fired you
last week.

You know what,
I should fire you right now.

No.

under Harvey Specter,

the only one.

threw her out.

this is him?

Clark and Owens
don't deserve this.

Which one is Owens,
by the way, the redhead?

332
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,996
You don't even know
who your associates are,

333
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:43,131
but you're here to complain
about losing them?

334
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,000
You bitter
because you were fired?

335
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:46,267
I'm not bitter, Harvey.

336
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:48,837
Unlike you, I don't take
things personally.

337
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:50,438
And by the way,
I was right.

338
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:52,540
I advised you to settle,
and you settled.

339
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,476
Your advice was for us
to settle,

340
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:56,111
and I lose
my law license.

341
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:57,479
And my question is,

342
00:11:57,546 --> 00:12:00,482
was taking that deal
your idea or Daniel Hardman's?

343
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,684
You think
Daniel's behind this?

344
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:04,452
You met with him
six days ago.

345
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,821
I'm not even gonna ask
how you know that.

346
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:08,289
I told you before,
Jessica.

347
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:09,658
I'm a straight shooter.

348
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,693
Daniel wasn't dictating
my actions then,

349
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:13,294
and he's not now.

350
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,096
Either way,
we are filing a claim

351
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:16,364
for tortious interference.

352
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:17,793
You're using
privileged information

353
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,933
to target our clients.

354
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,403
You really want to cry
foul to the ref?

355
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,638
You know who went to the ref
more than anyone?

356
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:26,141
Michael Jordan.
He did it quietly.

357
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,844
And he got six rings,
and he's my client.

358
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:32,080
Maybe I
should call him too.

359
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:33,748
You're not getting
Trent Devon.

360
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:36,518
You can't keep people
who want to leave, Harvey.

361
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:39,020
Everybody knows
about your civil war.

362
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:41,156
Pearson Hardman
is falling apart.

363
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:42,891
And I'm telling you,

364
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,796
the avalanche
has already started.

365
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:54,969
The Carillo contracts,
they should be signed

366
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:56,471
and on my desk.
I know.

367
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:57,806
Well,
since you're so in the know,

368
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,040
perhaps you can tell me
why I don't have them yet.

369
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:01,676
- Because they're not signed.
- Not signed?

370
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:03,078
I called earlier to have them
to have them messengered--

371
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:04,379
The story's already
taking too long.

372
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,413
And they said
they didn't need to see them.

373
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:06,815
Still waiting.

374
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:08,583
They said
they're no longer a client.

375
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,585
Harold.

376
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:12,087
No.
Harold didn't--

377
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:14,189
Louis,
Harold didn't do anything.

378
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:15,590
Harold never
does anything.

379
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:17,192
He got me the contracts
first thing this morning.

380
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,393
He worked all night.
They were really quite--

381
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,794
[grunts] Excuse me.
They were really quite--

382
00:13:19,862 --> 00:13:22,063
- "Quite" what?
- Good, actually.

383
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:23,598
Uhhuh. And how many
citations you correct?

384
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,866
- None.
- You're lying.

385
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,835
- No, I'm not.
- I don't care.

386
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:28,903
Wow. Yeah.
That is a tattoo.

387
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:30,572
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

388
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,075
Manatee--the slow,
gentle cow of the sea.

389
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,511
Uh, no.
It's a shark actually.

390
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:38,446
Totally.
No--yes.

391
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:39,547
That's a shark.

392
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:42,617
That is a big, wide,
fat shark.

393
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:44,219
You're fired.

394
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:46,721
- You can't fire Mike.
- <i>You.</i>

395
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:49,124
You moron. You can't
even get your firing right.

396
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:52,293
- I'm fired?
- Louis, come on.

397
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:53,628
Pack up your things and go.
Now.

398
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:54,896
But I did everything
you asked.

399
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:56,231
I delivered
the Carillo contracts.

400
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:57,432
I don't care.

401
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,101
The client fired us,
and now I'm firing you.

402
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:01,669
Times are tough,
people.

403
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:04,806
We can't afford mistakes.
We can't afford incompetence.

404
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:07,075
You can't cut it,
get out.

405
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,476
There is no place
for mediocrity here

406
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:09,878
at Pearson Hardman,

407
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:13,882
and there's certainly no place
for someone like you.

408
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:17,519
Everyone else
get back to work.

409
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:27,925
You know,
I didn't just do

410
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,227
what he asked for Carillo.

411
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:30,328
I went way beyond.

412
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:31,729
I didn't make
any mistakes,

413
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:33,231
and I know that they're not
leaving because of me.

414
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:34,999
So why didn't you
say that to him?

415
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:37,902
Because he
makes me freeze.

416
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,003
[Sighs]

417
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:40,238
You know,
sometimes I wish

418
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:42,807
we would've known each other
at Harvard.

419
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,511
Yeah. Yeah.
Harvard.

420
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:48,379
You probably hung out
with Duncan and those guys.

421
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,748
I hung out
with the library.

422
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:52,383
I'm such a loser.

423
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:53,951
No, you're not,
Harold.

424
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,520
Look, for the record,

425
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:58,122
Duncan was a douche.
He <i>was</i> a douche.

426
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,991
- Totally.
- Like a douchy-douche.

427
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,292
Do you remember that thing
he used to do with the--

428
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,640
- I know.
- You know what I mean?

429
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:05,396
[Laughter]

430
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:06,964
See,
that's what I mean.

431
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,066
If you would've known me
there,

432
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,300
then at least
someone here would know

433
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,468
that I wasn't always
like this.

434
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,036
People used to come
to me

435
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:13,838
for help
on their essays.

436
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:15,606
We'd sit in the quiet
of my apartment

437
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,141
where no one
was yelling at me,

438
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,577
and I could think
and write.

439
00:15:19,645 --> 00:15:23,481
- Really?
- Yeah.

440
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,050
Here.

441
00:15:26,118 --> 00:15:28,386
This is the first essay
I wrote in law school.

442
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:30,655
Look
at the Professor's comments.

443
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,757
Holy shit.

444
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:36,394
Louis is right.
I don't belong here.

445
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:38,162
No, he's not.

446
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,597
- Thomas.
- Poconos weekend.

447
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:41,165
- With the girlfriend.
- Which one?

448
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,601
- Doesn't matter.
- Done. Winters?

449
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,069
- Lunch with the mayor.
- Campos.

450
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:47,071
- Lunch with me.
- Lunch with me.

451
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:49,207
- Benson?
- Box at the Garden.

452
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:50,575
Have Lundqvist meet him
pre-game.

453
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:51,576
Does the king do that?

454
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:53,177
He does for me.
Siebertz.

455
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,712
- Tickets.
- Super Bowl.

456
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,280
- Broadway.
- Really?

457
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,482
Beneath
that lumberjack chest

458
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:58,583
beats the heart
of a songbird.

459
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,618
Fine.
Anything but <i>Cats.</i>

460
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:01,619
<i>Cats</i> closed
over a decade ago.

461
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,020
What took 'em
so long?

462
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,456
That's it then.
We're done.

463
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:06,758
Closed them all.

464
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:09,360
That's just foreplay.
We didn't close shit.

465
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,229
I want to have talked
to every one of my clients

466
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:12,463
by the end
of the day.

467
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:14,866
You stay on Trent Devon
until he takes the call.

468
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,000
I will.

469
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,035
And, Harvey...

470
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,773
No one
is leaving you.

471
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,711
[Knock on door]
Okay.

472
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,679
Harold is
totally freaked out.

473
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:30,114
I think he's gonna have
an ulcer,

474
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:31,983
but the good news is he'll never
disappoint you again,

475
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,187
so you can go and magnanimously
hire him back now.

476
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:37,522
Why would I do that?

477
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,024
Um, I don't know,
because you made your point.

478
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:41,959
You think
that was a show?

479
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:44,862
Look,
I know Harold can be...

480
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,397
Harold.

481
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,199
He's an idiot savant
minus the savant.

482
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,334
He tries hard.
He's a good person.

483
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:52,203
Yeah, well, then tell him
to join the Peace Corps.

484
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:54,272
Why don't you just give him
a second chance?

485
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,841
I did, Mike.
It was called his second day.

486
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:58,230
You realize you need cause,
right?

487
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:59,477
You want a cause?

488
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:01,112
He left a zero off
the Hopkins settlement,

489
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,648
which cost the client
$360,000.

490
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,683
He filed a motion
with the appeals court

491
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:08,186
instead of the superior court,
which accidentally triggered

492
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:09,387
a death penalty review.

493
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,022
And then
the one and only time

494
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,891
that I take him to court
with me, his fly was down,

495
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,260
and he called the judge
"Your Owner."

496
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,030
[Laughs]

497
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:21,799
You know why he does
those things, right?

498
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:23,801
Because you
intimidate him.

499
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,670
You brutalize him.

500
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:26,737
You're always talking
about how great

501
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:27,905
you are at grooming us.

502
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:29,574
Well, you were not great
at grooming him.

503
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,242
If he can't take
a drill sergeant yelling at him,

504
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,777
how can he handle
people shooting at him?

505
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,085
People don't shoot at us,
Louis.

506
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:36,948
Don't they?

507
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,216
Okay.
You know what?

508
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:42,253
You want him to stay...

509
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:45,756
Fine.
He can stay.

510
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:46,791
Thank you.

511
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:47,959
One condition.

512
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,493
You personally guarantee

513
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,028
every piece
of work product

514
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:52,697
that Harold sends
out of this office

515
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:53,931
just like I have.

516
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:55,166
You check everything
he does.

517
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,701
You cross every "t,"
dot every "I,"

518
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:59,537
and still do everything
you have to for Harvey.

519
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:02,540
People may not be shooting
at us, but we are at war.

520
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:05,109
So how does that work
for you?

521
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:09,413
Do we have a deal?

522
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:19,156
Harold.

523
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,325
I was just coming by
to wish you well.

524
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,394
Thanks, Rachel,
but I think it's gonna be okay.

525
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:25,296
Mike's talking to Louis
right now.

526
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:26,430
Really?

527
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,933
That's great.

528
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:36,440
Well?

529
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:45,316
There was nothing
I could do.

530
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:48,686
It's okay.
I know you tried, Mike.

531
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,788
If it'll make
you feel better,

532
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:53,457
you're not the only person
being let go this week.

533
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:56,594
Well, Clark and Owens
are only getting let go

534
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:57,828
because someone found out
that they're moving

535
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:59,797
to Bratton Gould
with McKinney and Kline.

536
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:01,832
- They are?
- Yeah, I overheard it.

537
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,036
I guess some people
will choose any port in a storm.

538
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:09,674
Harold,
good luck.

539
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:13,244
You too.

540
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,821
[Sighs]

541
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,690
This sucks.
It does.

542
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:29,360
He didn't deserve that.

543
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,066
Allison's not done.

544
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,801
We know.
We're working all the clients.

545
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:39,303
No, it's more than that.
She's taking McKinney and Kline.

546
00:19:39,371 --> 00:19:40,338
It's just
two more associates.

547
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:44,675
No,
it's more than that.

548
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:46,410
I tell you
the rats are jumping ship,

549
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:47,611
and you say it's fine,
but Donna nods,

550
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,079
and you're busting out
life jackets?

551
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:50,681
You have a history
of panicking.

552
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:51,782
He's not panicking.

553
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,484
Clark, Owens,
McKinney, Kline--

554
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:54,785
these aren't
just fifth-years.

555
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:56,153
They're
the best fifth-years.

556
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:57,861
They're Louis's
first class of associates.

557
00:19:57,923 --> 00:19:59,690
He gave her
a report card?

558
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,926
Harvey,
you do not know that.

559
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,894
Well,
I'm gonna goddamn find out.

560
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:06,964
[Laughs]
Stop.

561
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:08,566
Just cut it out.

562
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:09,834
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

563
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,335
Bye.

564
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:12,903
I never liked you,
Louis.

565
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:14,839
You're a vindictive,
sniveling rat,

566
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:16,907
but I never thought
you'd betray your own firm.

567
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:19,210
I never betrayed
this firm.

568
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:20,717
What do you call helping
Allison Holt

569
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:21,746
poach our associates?

570
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:23,881
I had nothing to do
with that.

571
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:25,549
I love this firm,
Harvey.

572
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,084
You were a traitor
when you voted for Hardman,

573
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:28,285
and you're
a traitor now.

574
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,587
Like I've told you before,

575
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:30,688
I'm not the only one

576
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:31,756
in this firm
who voted for Hardman.

577
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:33,090
And I voted to oust him
once I knew.

578
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:35,059
Once you knew you had
to save your own ass.

579
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:36,327
All right, you know what,
Harvey, just get out.

580
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:40,164
Get out.

581
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:43,801
Ri--
I did nothing wrong.

582
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,436
Jesus!

583
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:47,071
You bugged my office.

584
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:49,407
You ran to Hardman
about the CM lawsuit.

585
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,776
You sold your soul
for senior partnership.

586
00:20:51,843 --> 00:20:54,278
And once you got it,
you created a drug policy

587
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:57,248
with the sole purpose
of firing me!

588
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:58,282
I did it
for Hardman.

589
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,617
Maybe Hardman
wanted me dead,

590
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:01,185
but you're the one
who went out,

591
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:02,820
got the gun,
aimed it,

592
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,889
and fired it at my head.

593
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:06,157
And it blew up
in my face!

594
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,493
And what would have happened
if it didn't?

595
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,362
I was under orders.

596
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,950
Were you also under orders
when you ran

597
00:21:12,998 --> 00:21:14,498
to Hardman
about Monica Eton?

598
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,101
How do you know
it was me?

599
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:19,170
Because I set it up!

600
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:22,406
Because I know
who you are!

601
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:25,142
Are you still
gonna tell me

602
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,644
you're not helping Allison?

603
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:28,813
Harvey,
I swear to God

604
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,449
I did not do this.

605
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:32,716
Maybe not.

606
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:34,552
But now that you've done
what you've done,

607
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:38,556
I will never trust you.

608
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:42,927
Pearson Hardman
is my life.

609
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:45,996
Well, here's what's
gonna happen from now on.

610
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:49,266
You and I,
we're done.

611
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:51,769
Don't drop by
my office.

612
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:54,438
Don't ask Donna
for information.

613
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:55,873
You're the guy
that nobody wants

614
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:59,743
but we can't get rid of.

615
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:02,480
I'm a senior partner.

616
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:04,615
So I can't
make you leave.

617
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:07,051
But as far
as I'm concerned,

618
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,855
you don't even work here
anymore.

619
00:22:10,922 --> 00:22:13,591
[Clatters]

620
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,502
That glass
does not look halffull.

621
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,543
You're cherry-picking
Pearson Hardman associates.

622
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,911
I only want
the best cherries.

623
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:46,447
Then why not go
after the gardener who grew 'em?

624
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:48,750
You want to leave
Pearson Hardman.

625
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:51,753
I'm a proven commodity who
delivers outstanding billables.

626
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,288
With an unparalleled knowledge
of finance.

627
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,223
Yeah, I'm well aware
of who you are, Louis.

628
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,859
But how do I know
that Harvey Specter

629
00:22:57,927 --> 00:22:59,427
didn't just send you here?

630
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,629
'Cause I'm the last person
that Harvey Specter would trust.

631
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:02,664
Just ask Daniel Hardman.

632
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:05,266
I did.
He said you betrayed him.

633
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:07,502
Like I said,
I am well aware of who you are.

634
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,137
Well, if you spoke to Daniel,
then you would know

635
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,639
that he lost Pearson Hardman
not because of my betrayal

636
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:12,807
but because of his own.

637
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:16,911
My loyalty does not sway
with the wind.

638
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,513
I'm leaving
Pearson Hardman

639
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:20,081
because there's no room
for me there anymore.

640
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,649
You could go anywhere.

641
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:23,251
Well, I've done
my homework.

642
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,955
You guys are expanding.
You are hiring well.

643
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,457
You're gonna have
a young staff

644
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:30,725
that needs guidance.

645
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:32,493
You know
that I'm the right fit.

646
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:33,928
And I want
to move now.

647
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,697
You have
a non-compete clause.

648
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,244
Jessica is gonna waive
the non-compete

649
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:38,666
as long
as I don't take clients.

650
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:41,736
- I wouldn't if I were her.
- Well, you're not.

651
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:43,004
Harvey wants me gone,

652
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:46,808
and he has a way
of getting what he wants, so--

653
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:50,845
There might be
a partnership position

654
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:53,314
for you.

655
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:55,149
Senior partnership.

656
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:57,652
That, you're gonna have
to earn.

657
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,987
I have earned it.

658
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:00,388
And I'm not giving up
what I've worked for

659
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:01,589
my whole life.

660
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:04,592
Louis, you have made
a tactical error.

661
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,094
You've shown me
all your cards,

662
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,695
you can't offer
any clients,

663
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:09,097
and you're being forced
to leave a place

664
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:10,298
that doesn't want you.

665
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,368
You are a very good fit
for us.

666
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:16,037
But if you want
to join us,

667
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:18,773
you're gonna have to prove
how much you want it.

668
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:20,008
Please don't do this.

669
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:22,510
Do what?
I'm just negotiating.

670
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:26,147
You have
an empty title.

671
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:30,051
If you come with us,
I promise

672
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,388
that you will be
truly valued.

673
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:43,598
Well, that's it.

674
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,566
I've talked to every client
except Trent Devon.

675
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:46,701
Well, I know
why he's returning

676
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:48,049
Allison's calls
instead of yours.

677
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:49,270
Because he thinks
we're not focused.

678
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:50,371
That's not enough.

679
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,807
Come on. You taught me
to always ask...

680
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,008
What's in it for him?

681
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,556
"If we're looking
to expand our reach,

682
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,011
"then Trent Devon's
data platform

683
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,847
provides the perfect symbiosis
with our search algorithms."

684
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,551
Page 23,
the CEO of flash-start.

685
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,553
Allison doesn't
represent them.

686
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:08,189
Google bought Meebo
for $100 million.

687
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,524
Allison is trying to do
the same thing

688
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,591
with Flash-Start.

689
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,360
Allison doesn't
represent them.

690
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,796
Pretend she does.

691
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:16,998
Trent gets $100 million,

692
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,566
but his company
gets swallowed up,

693
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:19,767
and that's not
what he wants.

694
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:20,802
Well, what if they let him run
both companies?

695
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:21,909
That's too good
to be true.

696
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,071
It's happened before.

697
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,039
So if that's true,
all we need to do

698
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,607
is figure out a way
to beat that deal.

699
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:29,977
We can't beat that deal.

700
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:33,214
Okay.
So what do we do?

701
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:40,955
Why didn't you
just tell me?

702
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:42,557
Allison said
you had a history

703
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,059
and that it might get in the way
of what she was offering.

704
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,195
- Flash-Start.
- Very good.

705
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:48,496
But Allison
doesn't represent them.

706
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:50,798
No, but she does represent
a hedge fund

707
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:53,101
that's about to buy
a controlling interest.

708
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:54,268
And let me guess.

709
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:55,903
They want you
to run the whole thing.

710
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,939
We'll take on Google.

711
00:25:58,006 --> 00:25:59,774
And let me guess.

712
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:01,209
You're here to try
and beat it.

713
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:03,711
No, I'm here to tell you
to take it.

714
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,079
If I were you,
I would,

715
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,882
and I would hire the lawyer
who brought it to me.

716
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,883
Thanks, Harvey.

717
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:09,984
You're welcome.

718
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:13,755
There's just one thing.

719
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,190
I wonder,
what's in it for her?

720
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:17,391
What are you implying?

721
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:19,193
Let me look over the deal.
My own time.

722
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,562
If it is what she says it is,
I'll tell you.

723
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,598
If it's not,
you'll want to know.

724
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,266
- Harvey, I already told you--
- Look.

725
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,701
You said
we weren't focused,

726
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:28,503
and I'm not here to try
to convince you that we were.

727
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,772
But you also said
you've always trusted me,

728
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:36,611
and I'm telling you,
trust me one more time.

Do you need something?

00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:47,922
Actually, yes.

732
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,791
I need you to waive
my non-compete,

733
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,628
so I can take a position
at another firm.

Bratton Gould.

735
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:58,399
I had nothing to do
with Allison Holt's poaching.

736
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,402
What did
she offer you?

737
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,572
I went to her.

738
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,274
Why?

739
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:09,977
I got Harvey's message.

740
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,880
What message?

741
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:15,817
You don't know?
It doesn't matter.

742
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,451
This is what he wants.

743
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,690
And this is
what you want?

you can't take clients.

Oh, I wouldn't
even if I could.

why I instituted

the Louis Litt
rehabilitation program?

750
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,310
Because I was seduced
by Daniel Hardman once too.

751
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:47,882
He made me feel special
and smart and valued.

752
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,550
The problem was

753
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:52,820
he really didn't give
a shit about me.

754
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:55,590
But I will give him
one thing.

755
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:59,961
He was right
about you.

What?

763
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:36,898
Were we really quitting,

764
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,000
or was that just a move
to get to the contract?

765
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,635
You don't think I have
his best interests at heart?

766

That's not
what I asked.

If it's a good deal,
he should take it.

it's too good to be true.

did I say?

But then when they punched
in the time clock,

to steal the sheep,

it was brutal.

Not good, Harvey.

875
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:37,023
We can agree
to disagree.

876
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:38,691
We're not agreeing
on anything.

877
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,593
You pushed Louis
out the door.

878
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:42,161
It was not your call
to make.

879
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,831
Louis may or may not have
helped Allison,

880
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:48,468
but he has betrayed you, me,
and this entire firm.

881
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:49,469
We're better off.

882
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:50,603
If you
really believe that,

883
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:52,038
then something's
got you off your game.

884
00:33:52,106 --> 00:33:53,706
- Jessica, I'm not off my--
- No.

885
00:33:53,774 --> 00:33:56,042
Not you.
Me.

886
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,012
Your job
is to help me.

887
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,613
And when I say
you are off your game,

888
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:02,682
you say,
"how do I get it back?"

889
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,419
I went to Louis
to get him back on board,

890
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:08,554
and you made an end run
around me.

891
00:34:08,622 --> 00:34:10,590
When does it stop?

892
00:34:10,658 --> 00:34:11,724
We can't let Trent go
with Allison.

893
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:14,093
He's gonna...get screwed.

894
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:18,131
I'm--I'm sorry.

895
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:19,666
It's nothing.
[Stammers]

896
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:21,768
It's just some stairs.
[Mutters]

897
00:34:21,835 --> 00:34:23,136
[Chuckles]

898
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:25,705
Oh, God.

899
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,074
I'm so sorry.
I didn't see her there.

900
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:29,242
Who did this to you?

901
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,110
- I'm fine.
- You're not.

902
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:32,612
And after I'm done
kicking his ass,

903
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,113
the guy who did it
isn't gonna be either.

904
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:35,949
- Harvey, just let it go.
- That's not who I am.

905
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:38,484
I deserved it.

906
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:41,754
- What did you do?
- I don't want to tell you.

907
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:43,356
I wouldn't call this
getting your shit together.

908
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:44,691
I don't want to tell you
because of the story

909
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:48,761
you told me about your mom
and your dad.

910
00:34:50,664 --> 00:34:51,798
You got off easy.

911
00:34:51,865 --> 00:34:55,168
I know.

912
00:34:56,937 --> 00:34:58,237
It's a bad deal.

913
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,739
What, you're reading
between the lines?

914
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,975
'Cause I couldn't find anything
in the contract.

915
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,977
Because the problem's
not in the contract.

916
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:05,878
You said it yourself.
The deal's too good to be true.

917
00:35:05,946 --> 00:35:07,113
The financials
don't support it.

918
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:08,815
What, you get your MBA
overnight?

919
00:35:08,882 --> 00:35:10,316
No.

920
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:12,018
You went to Louis?

921
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:13,386
We worked all night.

922
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:14,754
He didn't betray us, Harvey.
He found the problem.

923
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,856
They never wanted anything to do
with Trent's company.

924
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:18,024
After the deal,
they're just gonna sell it off

925
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:19,325
for spare parts.

926
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:20,827
That won't get them
what they paid for it.

927
00:35:20,894 --> 00:35:22,294
But it'll get them
what they wanted.

928
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,263
- Trent.
- Exactly.

929
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,065
Louis figured this out?

930
00:35:26,133 --> 00:35:28,134
Trent's contract
has the same problem as Louis's.

931
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:29,335
He's got a non-compete.

932
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:30,470
They couldn't get him
to run the company

933
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:31,471
unless they bought his.

934
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:33,072
Now Louis wants back in.

935
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,307
No, he doesn't.

936
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:38,011
This is just his way
of saying he's sorry.

937
00:35:44,745 --> 00:35:46,979
It's not on the menu,
but might I suggest

938
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:48,447
the "I got my ass kicked"
Martini?

939
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:49,682
It goes well

940
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,250
with the "second-tier law firm"
potato skins.

941
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:52,518
Those come
with bacon?

942
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:54,920
I don't know,
never had 'em.

943
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,822
I take it
my client's not coming.

944
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,157
He was your client,

945
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:00,359
but then you offered him
a deal too good to be true.

946
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:03,229
You got
the paperwork.

947
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:05,598
Because he trusted me.

948
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,233
Well played, Harvey.

949
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,001
No.
Here's the play.

950
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:10,703
He's gonna take
his company public,

951
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,371
like I told him to
months ago.

952
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:15,541
A deal my new client,
a certain hedge fund,

953
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:17,276
just agreed
to underwrite.

954
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,211
You know Edelson Investments,
don't you?

955
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,379
I do.

956
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:22,348
Apparently,
I used to represent them.

957
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,016
Ah,
you're taking this well.

958
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:25,918
What do you want me to do,
cry?

959
00:36:25,986 --> 00:36:27,219
Harvey,
we play the game.

960
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,622
Sometimes we win,
sometimes we lose.

961
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,090
Not me.

962
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:34,627
Which brings me
to a suggestion of my own.

963
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:36,462
Come work
for Bratton Gould.

964
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,696
Come work for <i>you?</i>

965
00:36:37,764 --> 00:36:39,065
<i>With</i> me.

966
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:41,172
Did you not hear what I said
about the potato skins?

967
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:42,668
You're second-tier.

968
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:43,969
What about you?

969
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,838
There's blood in the water,
Harvey.

970
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:47,006
You may have fended off
this attack,

971
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:48,674
but we're not
the only ones circling.

972
00:36:48,742 --> 00:36:51,210
We fended you off,
we'll fend off the rest.

973
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:52,411
With who?

974
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:54,447
I got all
your best senior associates,

975
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:56,515
your future,
and I'm not done.

976
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,551
We'll see
about that.

977
00:36:58,618 --> 00:37:01,153
Lunch is on us.

978
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:03,722
After all, we just landed
a huge, new client.

979
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,192
You say "we,"
but I don't see

980
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:09,161
your name
on the door.

981
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,796
Mike, Mike, Mike.
I got your call.

982
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:12,565
You said you owed me one,
right?

983
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:13,833
Yeah,
and I meant it too.

984
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,134
Well,
you're gonna pay me back.

985
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:17,536
I'm happy to,
'cause listen to me,

986
00:37:17,604 --> 00:37:18,838
when I bring you in,

987
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:20,940
and you kick ass,
I look kick-ass.

988
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:24,710
Got your resume?
Right there.

989
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:27,847
You gotta be kidding me.

990
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:28,948
Oh, you didn't think
it was gonna be easy

991
00:37:29,015 --> 00:37:29,949
to pay me back,
did you?

992
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:31,317
Harold?

993
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:32,985
I'm not gonna look kick-ass.

994
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:34,620
I'm gonna look ass-kicked.

995
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:37,022
Look at how he did.

996
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,390
Are you kidding me?

997
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,592
You keep saying that.

998
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:40,860
Man, we talking
about the same Harold?

999
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:42,461
I know.

1000
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:43,863
Seriously,
Mike, man,

1001
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,464
if this doesn't work,
I'm gonna look like shit.

1002
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:48,000
Jimmy,
he needs a second chance

1003
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:49,235
just like you did.

1004
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:51,570
[Sighs]
All right, all right.

1005
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:53,172
You won't regret it.

1006
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,206
Harold's great.

1007
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:57,176
You're gonna love
his new tattoo.

1008
00:37:57,244 --> 00:37:58,177
He's here,
isn't he?

1009
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:01,814
Right over there.

1010
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,691
Not only do you retain
one client,

1011
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:14,026
you landed another.

1012
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:16,061
I knew there was a reason
why I kept you around.

1013
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:18,764
And a reason Allison Holt's
trying to steal me away.

1014
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:21,567
Congratulations.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

1015
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,302
What could possibly
go wrong?

1016
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,738
Congratulations.
That's what I said to Mike.

1017
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:27,907
Him too?
She's after everyone.

1018
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:29,275
Don't worry.
He's staying.

1019
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:30,743
Loyal as a basset hound.

1020
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,279
Oh.
Are they particularly loyal?

1021
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:37,583
I turned her down.

1022
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:38,584
But?

1023
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,654
I want my name
on the door.

1024
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:45,691
I don't want to end
around you anymore.

1025
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:49,328
I want to discuss things
with you as an equal.

1026
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:51,163
It's a little late for that,
don't you think?

1027
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:54,466
How long are we gonna walk
by his name on the wall, huh?

1028
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:55,935
They're coming
after us,

1029
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:58,337
and they're not gonna stop
until we send them a message

1030
00:38:58,405 --> 00:38:59,471
that we are whole.

1031
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,040
I'm not gonna just slap

1032
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:02,841
someone else's name up there,
Harvey.

1033
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:05,444
- "Someone"?
- I told you once.

1034
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,947
You don't make decisions
when you're reeling from a loss.

1035
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:10,983
And your response was,
"let's quit today."

1036
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:12,618
Not quit.
Fight.

1037
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,553
Without any thought
for the consequences.

1038
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:16,655
With my gut,
which serves me well.

1039
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:18,490
As a closer,
not a leader.

1040
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:19,592
Jessica.

1041
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,026
Watson, Klyman,

1042
00:39:21,094 --> 00:39:22,861
Gallo, Goldberg, Specter.

1043
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,830
The first five senior partners
you named.

1044
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:27,266
The first five major moves
I made.

1045
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:29,201
All success stories.

1046
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,370
Last week,
you had me steal someone

1047
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:33,906
from the D.A.'s office
for reasons you won't say.

1048
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:36,041
We won't even go
into what you did to Louis.

1049
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:38,010
And then
there's the cherry on top.

1050
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:39,478
- Mike.
- Who showed up this morning

1051
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:41,513
beaten to a pulp.

1052
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:42,881
He also beat Hardman
to a pulp.

1053
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:45,417
One day, what he is
isn't going to be enough

1054
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:47,386
to make up
for what he isn't.

1055
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:51,090
Which is
how you feel about me.

1056
00:39:51,157 --> 00:39:53,692
Harvey, what was
Michael Jordan's record

1057
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,727
on the Bulls?

1058
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:57,563
664 wins,
285 losses.

1059
00:39:57,631 --> 00:40:00,266
More than twice as many wins
than losses.

1060
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,569
Do you know what his record was
in the front office?

1061
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:05,904
- No.
- 185 to 291.

1062
00:40:05,972 --> 00:40:09,541
Almost twice as many losses
as wins.

1063
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:10,876
You know
how I know that?

1064
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:12,711
Because you knew one day,
I'd come in here

1065
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:15,948
asking for this.

1066
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:17,850
Because I look
at the future

1067
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,586
like an adult.

1068
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,921
Are you saying
it's a no?

1069
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:27,226
I'm saying
I'm not rushing this decision

1070
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:30,229
and that your judgment
that day was wrong.

1071
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,505
Thank you.

1072
00:40:41,574 --> 00:40:43,208
[Clears throat]

1073
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:46,712
- Hey.
- Hey.

1074
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,247
I thought
you'd like to know

1075
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:52,851
that Harold got a job
at another firm.

1076
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:54,714
Good.

1077
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,223
Look, Rachel--

1078
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:01,894
He found out,
didn't he?

1079
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,529
I just want you
to know that it was

1080
00:41:03,596 --> 00:41:07,099
after I ended things
with Tess.

1081
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:11,603
I want you to know
that I just don't give a shit.
