查理・布拉德布利
Charlie Bradbury?

12
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,270
天呐
Aah! Geez!

13
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,410
我删掉硬盘上的东西
I erase the drive first.

14
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,140
然后继续过我的小日子  行吗
Then I go back to my old life, right?

15
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,140
你没有小日子可继续了
You don't have an old life anymore.

16
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,710
永远不要再找我了  行吗
Never contact me again, like, ever.

17
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,550
如果你要留下来  我会和你在一起
If you stay, I would be with you.

18
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,250
但如果你要离开  别再回来了
But if you leave... don't come back.

19
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,450
无论你的决定是什么
Whatever you decide...

20
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,890
决定吧
...decide.

21
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,360
听着  本尼
Listen, Benny.

22
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,390
我永远不会忘记你为我做的一切
Everything you've done for me I will never forget,

23
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,630
但是
but, uh...

24
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,130
就这样了
End of the line?

25
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,330
再见
Adios.

26
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,500
如今

27
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,350
你怎么能这样
How dare you?

28
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,780
兰斯
Lance.

29
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,450
没错  我就是在跟兰斯说话
Yeah, that's right. I'm talking to Lance, not --

30
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,890
我们都为了接近她耍手段
Well, then we both cut corners to get close to her,

31
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,020
但这不算作弊
but that wasn't cheating.

32
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,160
哥们  这只是游戏
Dude, it's just a game.

33
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,730
只是个游戏
It's just a game.

34
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,400
兰斯
你会付出代价

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,900
救命
Help!

36
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,310
救命
Help!

37
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,240

你没事吧
You ok, man?

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,710
我们有对付恶魔最厉害的武器
We have the most powerful weapon we've ever had against demons,

42
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,070
我们却不会使用
and we can't find a way to use it.

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,580
凯文在想办法了
Yeah, well, Kevin's on it.

44
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,950
又发现他会打电话来的
And when he finds something, he'll call.

45
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,210
我们等着就好
So we wait.

46
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,620
我们这几周都过得不容易
Look, we have both had a rough go over these past couple of weeks.

47
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,060
而且
And, uh...

48
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,330
我知道你的牺牲很大
I know what you gave up wasn't easy.

49
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,900
也许我们该放松一晚
Maybe we ought to take the night off --

50
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,100
去看部电影  找一两个酒吧喝酒
Go see a flick, hit a bar or two,

51
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,170
好好玩玩
have some fun.

52
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,840
你还记得那滋味吧  小萨姆
You remember fun, don't you, Sammy?

53
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,580
凯文  什么事
Kevin, what do you got?

54
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,350
盖思啊
Hey. Garth.

55
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,880
找张纸记下来吧
Why don't you grab a piece of paper?

56
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,720
是嘛  好的
Really? Okay. Uh, yeah.

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,150
-谢啦  伙计  -客气
- Thanks, man. - Yeah, all right.

58
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,860
-等等  盖思  还在吗  -嗯
- Oh, wait, hey, Garth. Garth, are you there? - Yeah.

59
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,790
你怎么知道我们在哪儿
H-how'd you know where we are?

60
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,860
你被盖思秒杀了
Yeah, you've been Garthed.

61
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,360
听着  你追踪我们就够糟的了
Look, it's bad enough that you're tracking us,

62
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,500
你居然还说什么
but it's even worse

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,800
我们被盖思秒杀了
when you say we've been "Garthed."

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,330
是啊
Yeah.

65
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,340
好吧  我们得关掉手机GPS
Okay, we got to lose the gps on our phones

66
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,970
因为盖思一直在追踪我们
because garth has been tracking us,

67
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,970
显然其他猎人也是  方便他分配任务
and other hunters, apparently, to assign cases.

68
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,110
挺效率啊
Smart.

69
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,610
鲍比也会这样
A total Bobby move.

70
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,780
怎么回事
What's the deal?

71
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,280
挺近的  密歇根  法明顿山
Uh, well, it's close -- Farmington Hills, Michigan.

72
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,950
有人在上锁的公寓里惨遭车裂
Dude got ripped limb from limb inside his locked apartment.

73
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,320
不是好事
That's not good.

74
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,620
猎魔
Working a case.

75
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,990
等着凯文消息的期间
As long as we're waiting on Kevin,

76
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,430
就把这当乐子吧
that'll be our fun.

77
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,700
警长
Sheriff.

78
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,140
我是塔戈特特工
Special agent Taggart.

79
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,270
这是我搭档罗斯伍德特工
This is my partner, special agent Rosewood.

80
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,610
联调局  你们挺迅速啊
FBI? You guys are quick.

81
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,010
尸体都没搬走呢
Haven't even got the body out yet.

82
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,580
联调局都是工作狂  不休息的
Well, the FBI is all work, no play.

83
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,070
这样吧  你跟我说下情况
You know, why don't you give me the tour

84
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,180
我搭档到处看看
while my partner looks around?

85
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,680
我自己干效率比较高
I work better on my own.

86
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,720
你们说了算  跟我来
Your world, agent. Follow me.

87
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,330
死者叫艾德・尼尔森  31岁
Vic's name was Ed Nelson, 31 years old,

88
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,530
保险核保人
an insurance-claim adjuster.

89
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,370
独居  这不奇怪
He lived alone, which was a real shocker,

90
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,510
这儿到处是玩具
considering his place is full of toys.

91
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,610
怎么回事
So what happened?

92
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,210
没有强行闯入的迹象
No sign of forced entry.

93
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,350
目前看来  他是被人绑起来  扯碎了
Near as we can tell, he was tied up and pulled apart.

94
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,680
不是吓死的就是流血致死
Died of the shock or massive blood loss.

95
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,220
这看他自己了
Dealer's choice on that one.

96
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,690
这些链条是怎么回事
So what about these chains?

97
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,190
那是锁子甲
That's actually chain mail.

98
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,030
不是吧
Seriously?

99
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,130
他手腕和脚踝上都有清晰的绳印
We did find clear rope-burn marks on his wrists and ankles.

100
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,610
那么
So, anything...

101
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,280
他身上有什么不见了吗
Missing from the body?

102
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,980
你是说除了胳膊腿吗
You mean aside from the arms and legs?

103
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,050
没有
Uh... nope.

104
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,850
都在呢  肠子肚子都在
All there -- twig and berries, too.

105
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,020
邻居有听到什么奇怪的声音吗
What about the neighbors? Did they hear anything weird?

106
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,190
楼下的邻居说
Uh, neighbor downstairs said

107
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,260
她半夜被惊醒
she got woke up in the middle of the night

108
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,030
因为听到马声
by the sound of horses

109
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,530
又是跺蹄子又是飞奔
stomping their feet and galloping.

110
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,200
我们没看到蹄印
We didn't find any hoofprints.

111
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,570
她听到的大概是电视  要么就是做恶梦
She probably heard a tv or was having a bad dream

112
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,340
她嗑药磕大了
or she was high as balls.

113
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,310
幸好  他手机上有条不错的线索
Fortunately, we got a real lead off his cellphone.

114
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,310
电话记录显示
According to the phone records,

115
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,580
艾德最后一通电话是跟兰斯・雅各布森
Ed's last call was from a guy called Lance Jacobsen,

116
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,120
一个会计  也是三十多  也是独居
an accountant, also 30s, also lives alone.

117
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,060
为什么说是线索
How's he a lead?

118
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,630
他们两人大概谈了15分钟
The two of them talked together for 15 minutes,

119
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,730
然后兰斯给艾德发了些怒气冲冲的短信
and then Lance sent Ed here all kinds of angry texts.

120
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,870
一些是一般的狠话
Some of them were your typical threat stuff,

121
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,970
也有些挺怪的
but some were a little weird.

122
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,600
怎么个怪法
Weird how?

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,800
比如
Like, uh...

124
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,540
你对我们的罪行要血债血偿
"You shall bleed for your crimes against us,"

125
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,980
后面是一个骷髅的表情
followed by the emoticon of a skull.

126
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,510
还有这个
And this beauty --

127
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,780
我是个法师  我会灭了你
"I am a mage. I will destroy you."

128
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,450
现在这些孩子  都在闹哪样啊
These kids today with their texting and murder.

129
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,790
我的人把兰斯带去局里问话了
My men just brought Lance into the station for questioning.

130
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,460
我们要先审他一下
Well, we're gonna need to take first crack at the suspect.

131
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,460
我说了  你们说了算
Like I said, agent, it's your world.

132
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,800
兰斯・雅各布森  我们是联调局的
Lance Jacobsen? We're with the FBI.

133
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,840
联调局
The FBI?

134
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,180
真不敢相信
I can't believe this is happening.

135
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,680
艾德居然死了
I can't believe Ed's dead.

136
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,420
兰斯
Lance?

137
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,250
兰斯  呼吸
Lance, just -- just breathe.

138
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,450
呼吸  没事的
Just breathe. You're fine.

139
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,820
我们得问你几个问题
We just need to ask you a few questions.

140
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,820
冷静一点
Try to calm down.

141
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,460
我们想问你
We want to know about the, uh --

142
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,500
你昨晚发给艾德的那些短信
the texts you sent Ed last night.

143
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,270
他们带我来的时候我就说了那些不是我发的
I told them when they brought me in those texts weren't from me.

144
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,770
但是你的手机和艾德的手机里都有记录
Well, your phone and Ed's phone say otherwise.

145
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,200
我是说是我发的  但不是我发的
No, I mean, they were from me, but they weren't from me me.

146
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,010
你真觉得这么说就清楚了
Did you really think that sentence was gonna clear things up?

147
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,950
对不起
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,620
这都是误会
This is all a big misunderstanding.

149
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,050
那些短信是以法师灰狐狸这个身份
Those text messages were from Greyfox the Mystic

150
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,990
发给贫士撒格瑞姆
to Thargrim the Difficult.

151
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,620
那是我们在月门里的角色
Our characters in Moondoor.

152
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,990
月门是我和艾德玩的游戏
Moondoor is a game that Ed and I play.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,030
我们玩真人扮演游戏
We're LARPers. Live-action role-playing?

154
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,070
是啊  真人扮演  是有意思
Right. Larping. Good times.

155
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,340
我们每隔一个周末在民俗公园玩月门
We play Moondoor every other weekend at Heritage Park.

156
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,270
一切信息都在我们网站上
All the info about it is on our website.

157
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,670
你们还有网站呢
You guys have a website.

158
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,710
是啊  一个玩家设计的
Yeah, one of the players designed it.

159
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,340
事实上  如果你登陆网站
In fact, if you log onto the site,

160
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,380
他们应该发布了昨晚集会的照片
they should have posted pictures from last night's feast.

161
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,750
我整晚都在那儿
I was there all night.

162
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,920
这些跟你发的短信有什么关系
What does any of this have to do with the texts?

163
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,520
我在游戏中的角色是法师灰狐狸
I play a character named Greyfox the Mystic.

164
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,390
我是游戏里一个法力极强的法师
I'm a very, very powerful mage in the game.

165
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,000
法力极强  继续
Okay, uh, very powerful. Go on.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,800
艾德是
Ed is...

167
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,470
艾德是老森林的撒格瑞姆 贫士
Ed was Thargrim the Difficult of the Elder Forest,

168
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,740
哈格里姆和布尔芬的儿子  兄弟是
son of Hargrim and Bouphin, brother to --

169
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,750
我是梅林他就是兰斯洛特
He was Lancelot to my Merlin.

170
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,720
你们既然这么铁  怎么发短信威胁他
Well, if you guys were so tight, then why the threatening messages?

171
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
我们被授予女王荣誉护卫一职
We were named to the queen's honor guard

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,120
是为这周末的诸国之战做准备
in anticipation of the coming battle of kingdoms this weekend.

173
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,890
我觉得他破坏了规矩
I thought he broke protocol,

174
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,230
所以结束后我打电话给他  说他作弊
so I called Ed after game hours and accused him of cheating,

175
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,560
我提出跟他决斗
and then I challenged him to a duel.

176
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,230
-决斗  -天明时分剑锋对魔杖
- A duel? - Wands and swords at dawn.

177
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,270
魔杖是指有魔法的手杖吗
Now, when you say "wands"" do you mean magic wands?

178
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,480
没有魔法  特工
No. Un-magic wands, agent.

179
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,810
因为我就想带着没魔法的去决斗呢
Because what I really want in a duel is an un-magic wand.

180
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,750
就是假魔杖  这叫游戏
Yes! Fake wands! It's a game!

181
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,590
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

182
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,420
诸神啊
Oh, ye gods!

183
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,130
撒格瑞姆 贫士陨落啦
Thargrim the Difficult has fallen!

184
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,370
兰斯  撑着点
L-Lance -- Lance. Hang in there, champ.

185
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,610
怎么样
So?

186
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,610
你相信游戏的这套话吗
Do you believe dungeons & dragons?

187
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,440
他没骗我们
He didn't put a whammy on us.

188
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,010
他是真的很难过  他不是凶手
Those weren't crocodile tears, man. That's not our guy.

189
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,300
那是怎么回事
So what are we looking at?

190
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,580
你看到锁子甲了
You saw the chain mail.

191
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,190
说不定是什么重口的情趣玩具呢
This could be "Fifty shades of Greyfox" for all we know.

192
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,020
好吧  我们看看月门的网站
All right, well, let's check out Moondoor site,

193
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,390
核实一下兰斯的话
See if Lance's story checks out.

194
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,070
欢迎加入月门  密歇根最大的真人扮演游戏
"Welcome to Moondoor, Michigan's largest larping game""

195
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,570
我还以为我们是最宅的呢
And I thought we needed to get out more.

196
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,680
他在这儿呢
There's our guy.

197
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,620
还挺不赖的
It actually looks kind of awesome.

198
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,090
这里有视频
All right, there's a video.

199
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:25,060
月门  阴谋诡计  荣誉激情
Moondoor. A world of intrigue, honor, passion.

200
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,290
四大王国
Four kingdoms --

201
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,360
月随者  精灵族
Followers of the moon, elves,

202
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,370
亡灵战士  和可怕的影兽人
warriors of yesteryear, and the dreaded shadow orcs.

203
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,050
都将在永世之地
All will fight on the Fields of Never

204
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,310
参加两年一次的诸国之战
in the biannual battle of kingdoms.

205
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,840
选择你的剑或权杖
Pick up a sword or a mace.

206
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,880
夺取月门  维护当今统治者
Take control of Moondoor and defend the current ruler...

207
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,550
等等  那不是
Wait, is that...

208
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,980
月女王
...the Queen of Moons.

209
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,560
天呐
Aah, god.

210
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,000
怎么回事
What the hell?

211
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,160
你们会想看看这个
You're gonna want to see this.

212
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,050
千万别是传染病
God forbid he was contagious.

213
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,760
我要去把自己泡在洗手液里
I'm gonna go dip myself in hand sanitizer.

214
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,790
没有电磁干扰  没有巫术袋  没有硫磺
No EMF, no hex bags, no sulfur.

215
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,130
我完全不明白  你呢
I got nada. You?

216
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,430
再看一次录像
Watch the video again.

217
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,770
瞧
There. See that?

218
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,570
跟艾德的一样
Same as Ed's.

219
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,900
或许他们有一样的纹身
I don't know. Maybe they had matching tattoos.

220
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,910
毕竟他们是好战友
I mean, they were brothers in arms.

221
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,040
你认得出吗
You recognize it from anything?

222
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,080
蒂姆・波顿的电影里出现过
A Tim Burton movie?

223
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,480
除了这个诡异的标记
Aside from the, uh, mark of the creepy here,

224
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,220
他们唯一的共同点就是真人扮演了
the only thing these guys have in common is larping.

225
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,320
幸好我们认识女王
Lucky for us, we know the queen.

226
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,140
我狂怒波尔塔将你押在这里
I, Boltar the Furious, bind you to this stock

227
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,710
让月门的所有人都能看清你的面目
so that all of Moondoor may see you for what you are --

228
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,240
一个贼
a thief.

229
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,280
我影兽人的兄弟会从黑山下来
My Shadow Orc brethren will descend from the Black Hills

230
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,620
而这里的...
and the tents of mo--

231
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,490
等等
Uh, hold.

232
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,320
谢谢你  杰里  真抱歉
Thanks, Gerry. Sorry.

233
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,650
不客气  蒙蒂
Yeah, no problem, Monty.

234
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,880
继续
Resume.

235
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,650
而月门的帐篷将浸透鲜血
And the tents of Moondoor will be bathed in blood

236
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,790
将那月女王罢黜
as we unseat the Queen of the Moons

237
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,960
她的王位是篡夺而来  名正言顺的国王
from the throne she stole from the rightful heir --

238
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,920
应是暗影之王
the Shadow King.

239
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,960
-你  -安静
- And you - - Silentium!

240
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,260
好好服刑吧  希顿
Serve your time with honor, Heathen.

241
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:35,370
如果你需要用夜壶  跺三次脚即可
And if you need to use the chamber pot, stomp your feet thrice.

242
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,240
打扰  你是玩真人扮演的吧
Excuse me. Hi. Uh, you are a larper, yeah?

243
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,970
我更喜欢说是"互动文学爱好者"
I prefer the term "Interactive literaturist""

244
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,310
我是罗斯伍德特工
Right. Uh, I am special agent Rosewood.

245
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,840
这位是塔戈特特工
This is special agent Taggart.

246
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,180
等等
Hold!

247
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,380
伙计们  我们这周末不玩穿越
Um, guys, we're not doing the whole genre-mash-up thing this weekend.

248
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,450
三个月才做一次
We only do that every third month.

249
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,620
什么
Uh... come again?

250
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,790
假徽章  低价西服
Your fake badges, the cheap suits.

251
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,990
挺不错的  你们是扮演联调局
It's very cool. I get it. Your characters are FBI agents

252
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,060
不知怎么  穿越到了月门
That somehow traveled to Moondoor,

253
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,430
但是我们这周只做月门
but I'm telling you it's straight-up Moondoor this weekend.

254
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,560
这不是假的
These aren't fake badges.

255
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,900
就是  而且做得很好
Uh, yeah, they are, and they're very good,

256
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,600
但是年底的时候  证件号变成10位的了
But, um, well, the I.D. number shifted to 10 digits

257
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,790
最后两位是字母
with two letters mixed in at the end of the year,

258
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,670
而且这个章是上个月的了
and, uh, the seal's from last month.

259
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,910
真的很不错
Really good work.

260
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,410
但这个周末有大战  好吗
It's just it's a tournament weekend, okay, guys?

261
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,710
你们得按规矩来
So you got to follow the rules.

262
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,010
如果没有规矩  就乱套了
If there's no rules -- chaos.

263
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,520
继续
Resume.

264
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,490
如果你们愿意加入月军
If you would like to join the Army of Moons,

265
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,890
女王一直在招募侍从
the queen is always on the lookout for new squires.

266
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,420
好吧
Yes. Right.

267
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,890
那请带我们去觐见女王
Uh, we would like to see your queen now, please.

268
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,650
女王的行程在几个月前就定好了
Well, the Queen's calendar is booked up months in advance.

269
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,600
但如果你们想看看她的军队
But if you wish to witness what's in store for you in her army,

270
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,400
女王陛下正在场地中检阅新兵
her highness is overseeing new squires on the pitch as we speak.

271
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,990
认输  我认输
Yield! I yield!

272
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,090
我爱你
I love you.

273
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,760
我知道
I know.

274
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,400
去我的医疗帐篷休息一会儿吧
Take your leave to my medical tent

275
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,360
治一下你腿上的伤
and attend to your... severed limbs.

276
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,440
灰狐狸和撒格瑞姆失踪了
Greyfox and Thargrim are missing.

277
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,190
我们向女神祈祷
We pray to the goddess

278
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,480
他们没有遭遇其他队伍的犯规行为
they have not fallen victim of foul play.

279
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,890
没有了他们
In their absence,

280
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,720
荣誉护卫队的力量就变弱了
the honor guard's ranks are weakened.

281
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,030
要加入...
To join...

282
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,830
该死
Oh, Blerg.

283
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,310
女王我需要一点私人时间
The Queen needs some royal "We" Time.

284
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,160
你们自己聊聊天
Talk amongst thyselves.

285
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,870
好剑
Nice balance.

286
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,030
哥们
Dude.

287
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,720
来了
Yeah.

288
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,980
查理
Charlie.

289
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,860
查理・布拉德伯里已经死了
Charlie Bradbury is dead.

290
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,480
她一年前就死了  你害死了她
She died a year ago. You killed her.

291
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,140
我叫卡莉・席勒顿
My name is Carrie Heinlein.

292
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,710
知道吗  你现在又要害死我了
Oh, and guess what. Now you killed her, too.

293
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,030
好吧  听着
Okay, listen.

294
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,070
不  我隐姓埋名
No, I buried myself.

295
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,610
然后迪克・罗曼倒台  他的公司也垮了
Then Dick Roman went down, his company belly-up,

296
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,830
我就想  终于安全了
And I figure, "Hey, it's all good",

297
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,090
我平安无事  能找回原来的生活
and I was fine. I got my life back.

298
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,870
可你们又出现了
Now you're here,

299
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,880
如果你们出现了  说明这儿有怪物
And if you guys are here, monsters are here.

300
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,030
为什么我总是这么倒霉
Why do I have such bad luck?

301
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,170
我算什么  怪物吸铁石吗
What am I -- some kind of monster magnet?

302
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,340
世上有这种的东西吗
Is there such a thing as a monster magnet?

303
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,080
算了  不要回答
You know what? Don't answer that.

304
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,090
我才不管
I don't care.

305
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,550
我关心的是不要再把手臂弄骨折
What I care about is not getting my other arm broken...

306
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,960
甚至丢掉小命
or dying.

307
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,480
那  我现在扔下剑
So, I'm dropping my sword

308
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,360
然后离开这里  混蛋们
and walking off the stage, bitches.

309
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,280
祝你们在城堡里扫荡愉快
Have fun storming the castle.

310
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,270
查理  查理
Charlie. Charlie!

311
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,990
灰狐狸和撒格瑞姆  也就是艾德和兰斯
Greyfox and thargrim -- uh, Ed and Lance --

312
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,270
他们没有失踪
They're not missing.

313
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,190
他们死了
They're dead.

314
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,720
车裂后流血而死
Drawn and quartered and bleeding out?

315
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,150
别再描述给我听了
Please stop talking again.

316
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,900
那你们认为是什么东西干的
So what do you think did this?

317
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,430
除了标记和都参加角色扮演以外
Well, aside from the mark and them both being larpers,

318
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,910
没什么其他的线索
there's really not much else to go on.

319
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,060
等等  我见过这个
Wait, I've seen this before.

320
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,850
这是凯尔特人的魔法标记
It's a Celtic magic symbol.

321
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,600
证物

322
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,590
起码在我最喜欢的电子游戏里是的
At least it was in my favorite video game.

323
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,210
这有用吗  我能走了吗
Does that help? Can I go now?

324
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,530
这是个开头  别走
It's a start, but no.

325
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,450
听着
Um, listen.

326
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,670
你能告诉我们一些关于艾德和兰斯的事吗
What can you tell us about Ed and Lance?

327
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,660
好人
Good guys.

328
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,570
女王曾经所向无敌的军队中最优秀的两名成员
Two of the best members of the Queen's ever-shrinking army.

329
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,440
曾经所向无敌
"Ever-shrinking"?

330
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,330
我的王国最近有些不顺
My kingdom has had a lot of bad luck lately,

331
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,210
也许是因为我  但也许与这事有关
probably 'cause of me, but maybe it's tied to this.

332
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,750
一个月前  
A month ago,

333
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,780
我的一个卫兵在战斗前摔伤了膝盖
one of my guys had both her ankles broken before battle.

334
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,740
再之前  
Before that,

335
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,680
有三个人在家里遭遇了事故而进医院
I had three people have hospital-worthy accidents while at home.

336
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,170
你们觉得这当中有关联吗
You think there's any connection there?

337
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,700
他们有共同的敌人吗
They have any enemies in common?

338
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,850
在现实生活中没有
In real life? No.

339
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,240
大家都和睦相处
Everyone gets along famously.

340
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,040
但是在游戏中  他们有很多敌人
In the game, though, they had tons of enemies.

341
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,230
红色代表月随者  就是我的人
Red reps the followers of the moon -- my peeps.

342
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,670
绿色代表精灵
Green's for elves,

343
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,460
月门

344
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,260
蓝色是亡灵战士
Blue's for warriors of yesteryear,

345
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,900
黑色是影兽人
and black's for shadow orcs --

346
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,540
彻底的混蛋
total d-bags.

347
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,530
这个周末将会有王国间的争斗
This weekend is the battle of the kingdoms

348
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,110
决定谁能带上永恒王冠
to see who wears the forever crown.

349
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,720
这个周末
This weekend,

350
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,180
每一个王国都是我们王国的敌人
each faction is definitely an enemy of me and mine.

351
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,140
知道吗  如果你...
You know, if you, uh...

352
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,870
撤回弓箭手并让宽剑手去西边
move your archers back and your broadswordsmen to the west...

353
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,400
-和亡灵战士一样  -对
- Huh. Like the warriors. - Yep.

354
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,380
好主意  谢谢
Hey, good call. Thanks.

355
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,420
那南边的城墙怎么办
What about the southern wall?

356
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,170
-伙计们  -什么
- Guys. - Yeah?

357
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,330
对哦  抱歉
Right. Sorry.

358
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,390
那也许其他王国的某个人
So maybe someone from one of the other kingdoms

359
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,620
掌握了真正的魔法
got ahold of real magic

360
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,320
并用来削弱你的军队
and started using it to weaken your army.

361
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,080
但为什么不直接针对我呢
But why not just come after me?

362
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,390
为什么会逐步升级
And why the escalation?

363
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,260
好吧  我们会仔细排查所有王国
All right, we will canvass the kingdoms.

364
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,530
你应该赶快离开这里
You should get out of here.

365
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,600
我们不想你受伤
We don't want you to get hurt.

366
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:39,840
等等
Whoa, wait.

367
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,600
查理比我们更加了解月门游戏
Charlie knows Moondoor a lot better than we do.

368
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,100
我们需要她
We need her.

369
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,110
萨姆  我觉得我们完全能够搞定
Sam, I think we can take care of

370
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,030
一群举着泡沫塑料剑的会计们
a bunch of accountants with foam swords.

371
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,390
我们需要任何能得到的帮助  迪恩
We need all the help we can get, Dean.

372
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,950
有人面临生命危险
People are dying.

373
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,250
我的想法是  一般你也都这么想
My point, which is usually yours,

374
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,890
她应该逃去一个安全的地方
is that she should get somewhere safe

375
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,090
恢复平凡的生活
and get back to a normal life.

376
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,650
我就在这里  我想要离开
Hey, I am right here, and I want to leave.

377
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,310
谢谢
Thank you.

378
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,380
但女王
But the Queen...

379
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,170
她必须留下
she has to stay.

380
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,230
萨姆说的对  有人有生命危险
I mean, Sam is right. People are dying.

381
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,680
我不能看着这事儿发生
That can't happen on my watch.

382
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,660
知道吗  我已经厌倦了逃亡
And you know what? I am tired of running.

383
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,180
我喜欢这里的生活
I like my life here.

384
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,060
我要留下  为此而战斗
I'm gonna stay and fight for it.

385
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,640
是我
Yeah.

386
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,450
好的
Okay.

387
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,300
谢谢
Thanks.

388
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,170
兰斯的毒理报告出来了
So, the toxicology report came back on Lance.

389
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,220
没有中毒
Nothing.

390
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,660
但法医说他的身体上有明显的痕迹显示
But the medical examiner said his body showed clear signs

391
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,080
他是被莨菪毒死的
that he was killed by belladonna.

392
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,650
-是黄片影星吗  -黄片影星吗
- The porn star? - The porn star?

393
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,570
是一种毒药
The poison.

394
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,010
但他们在体内找不到任何中毒痕迹
Um, however, they couldn't find a trace of it in his system.

395
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,450
就像他们在艾德的公寓里找不到一根绳子
Just like they couldn't find ropes in Ed's apartment.

396
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,130
查理  我想借用一下你的笔记本
Charlie, I'm gonna need to borrow your laptop.

397
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,800
月门游戏中不能带笔记本
There are no laptops in Moondoor.

398
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,380
干嘛  规定就是这样
What? There are rules.

399
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,530
但四个帐篷之外是技术支持帐篷
But there is a tech tent four tents down.

400
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,530
好吧
Okay.

401
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,070
不如你们俩查游戏里的人
How about you guys go canvas,

402
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,060
我去查死亡事件和这个标记
and I'll dig into these accidents and this mark?

403
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,770
好的
Okay.

404
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,410
我需要你们所到之地的所有情况
I'm gonna need a full wiki on where you guys have been.

405
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,310
但是首先  你要扔掉这西装
But first, you're gonna have to ditch the suit

406
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,730
如果你想和女王边走边谈的话
if you're gonna walk and talk with the queen.

407
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,430
当心
通往未来的传送门

408
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,780
打扰一下
Excuse me.

409
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,140
请问有没有一个在线玩家的目录
Do you know if there's a directory of online players?

410
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,560
有啊  在网页上有
Yeah, it's on the website.

411
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,480
有账号就能进入
All you need is an account to access it.

412
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,680
谢谢你
Um, thanks, uh...

413
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,530
玛利亚
Maria.

414
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,540
我是说  邪恶法师格兰吉雅
I mean, Gholandria the wicked.

415
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,350
你用萨姆前女友的身份跟他发短信
You sent Sam a phantom text from his ex?

416
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,570
真混球  先生
Dick move, sir.

417
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,450
是  偶尔犯浑而已
Yeah, not my finest hour.

418
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,310
他终于和这个妞找到点儿正常生活
So he found some normalcy with this chick,

419
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,360
然后都没了  再一次
and now it's gone... again.

420
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,510
都因为你
Thanks to you.

421
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,120
是啊  他这些投入的感情最多
Yeah, well, now he's more committed than ever,

422
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,740
所以麻烦就大了
so there's that.

423
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,480
但是  相信我  这种生活
But, trust me, this life --

424
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,990
你不能有任何牵挂
You can't afford attachments.

425
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,660
你只能让它  去吧
You just got to... let go.

426
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,030
我们还是在说萨姆
Are we still talking about Sam,

427
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,110
还是你最近也跟某人分手了
or did you break up with someone, too?

428
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,650
-我  -是啊
- Me? - Yeah.

429
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,220
不
No.

430
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:40,930
陛下
Your majesty.

431
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,530
你一直很喜欢真人扮演么
You always been into larping?

432
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,790
没呢
Nah.

433
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,780
比起角色扮演  我更喜欢台式机
For role-play, I prefer a tabletop.

434
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,800
龙与地下城  伽玛世界  汽车大战
D&D, Gamma world, Car wars.

435
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,280
那就是为什么克鲁苏发明了多面色子  不是吗
That's why Cthulhu invented multi-sided dice, right?

436
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,610
但是我的一个伙计喜欢真人扮演
But a buddy of mine was into larping.

437
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,260
寻他而来  为佳人而留
Went for him, stayed for the chicks.

438
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,580
也不是那样了
It's not just that, though.

439
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,360
这是种逃避
It's an escape.

440
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,590
在这里  我是女王  一个英雄
I mean, here, I'm queen, a hero.

441
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,380
在真实世界  我只是一个整天入侵代码
Out there in the real world, I'm just hacking out code

442
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,600
喝喝咖啡的人
and chugging coffee all day long.

443
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,550
等等
Now, wait a second.

444
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,860
如果不是你的话
If it wasn't for you,

445
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,720
我们永远都不会干掉迪克・罗曼
We would have never been able to take down Dick Roman.

446
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,670
在真实世界
Out there in the real world,

447
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,230
你也是个英雄
you are a hero.

448
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,040
我的女王
My Queen.

449
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,750
我注意到有很多女士在打量你
I'm noticing a lot of these maidens checking you out.

450
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,510
怎么了  我又不能阻止她们
What? I can't shut this down.

451
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:30,850
当女王真不错
It's good to be queen.

452
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,490
这  这只不过是游戏的一部分
It's -- it's all just part of the game.

453
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,810
混合技术搭建  酷
Genre mash-up. Cool.

454
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,440
我认识她  那是菲利斯
Hey, I know her. That's Phyllis.

455
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,570
听说她摔断了脚踝还是什么
Heard she broke her ankles or something.

456
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,320
哇  看起来她
Wow. It looks like she got --

457
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,970
跛了
Hobbled.

458
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,530
那个是杰米
Oh, and that's Jamie.

459
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,150
他说有人闯进他家
He said someone broke into his house,

460
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,790
用他自己的权杖锤打他  但是
beat him with his own mace, but --

461
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,420
没有闯入的痕迹
No signs of a forced entry.

462
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,850
你知道这是月门里的什么吗
Uh, do you recognize this from Moondoor?

463
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,550
我觉得这是凯尔特人的
I-I think it's Celtic?

464
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,280
不知道  不好意思
No. Sorry.

465
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,940
-但是我会查查看  -谢了
- But I'll look it up. - Thanks.

466
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,070
我在各个王国穿梭
I haven't seen anything like it

467
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,540
但从没见过这样的东西  圣上
in my travels throughout the realms, your highness.

468
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,500
好吧
All right.

469
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,830
如果你想到了什么  来我的帐篷见我

把精灵从单子上划掉
Scratch the elves off the list.

权杖  跛子  中世界毒药
Mace attacks, hobbling, medieval poisoning --

473
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,820
有人在对女王的人下手
Somebody's targeting the queen's people.

474
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,420
不  不只是他们
No, not only them.

00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,750
你看  这四个人是女王的
See, those four are with the queen,

476
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,660
这两个是精灵
but these two -- they're elves.

477
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,160
还有两个是亡灵战士
And these two are warriors.

478
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,580
唯一没有受害的人是
The only group not to get hit --

479
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,750
影兽人
The shadow orcs.

480

单子上最后的种族  不可能找到的
Last group on the list, impossible to find.

481
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,990
等等  我知道哪里可以找到
Wait, I know where we can find one.

482

-我进来的路上碰到的  -太棒了
- I met him on the way in. - Perfect.

483
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,910
也许他能告诉我们这是什么
Maybe he can tell us what the frack this thing is.

484
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,030
这是痛苦之树
It's, uh, the tree of pain.

485
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,660
如果你被这个标记了这个
Uh, if you are tagged with this mark,

486
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,080
你就会成为仙境魔法的受害者
You will be a victim of fairy magic.

487
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,620
等等  仙境魔法会对人不好
Wait. Fairy magic can be bad?

488
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,020
女王去死
Death to the queen!

489
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,050
篡位者去死

00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,190
男仆去死

怎么了
What?

492
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,750
月门里没有笔记本电脑
Well, there's no laptops in Moondoor.

493
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,460
这里也没有日内瓦公约
There's no Geneva Convention, either.

494
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,000
你看过这个吗
Have you seen this?

黑山

游乐场背后的森林  来吧

503
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,300
我从没有玩过混合技术搭建
I've never done genre-mash-up play before.

504
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,720
很有趣
That was fun.

505
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,910
一开始都是新鲜的  对吧
First time for everything, right?

00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,760
很多都可以是第一次
First time for a lot of things

女王殿下  你在这儿呢
My queen. There you are.

我找你找遍了
I've been searching everywhere for you.

512
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,850
这个呆瓜要用他渎神的利剑
Has this... oaf attempted to harm you

513
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,730
伤害您吗
with his blasphemous metalworks?

00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,400
波尔塔  他和我一路的  这是我的新

侍女
Handmaiden.

516
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,460
我们在找认识暗影之王的人
We seek an audience with the shadow king.

517
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,760
这些山不安全
Uh, these hills are not safe.

518
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,910
我恳求您  我的女王  请回帐吧
I beseech you, my queen, you should return to camp.

519
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,040
他是对的  我主
He's right... your worshipfulness.

520
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,630
在你离开前我能说两句话吗
Uh, may I have a moment before you take your leavings?

521
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,550
女仆
Handmaiden?

522
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,780
他生疑了  我很惊慌
He was suspicious. I panicked.

523
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,310
好吧  你拿着我的电话
All right, look. You take my phone.

524
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,790
找到萨姆  我们来找暗影呆瓜

00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,070
你帮忙找萨姆  去吧
Yeah, you are helping by finding Sam. Go.

527
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,860
带路去找兽人吧  波尔蒂
Lead the way to the orcs, Bolty.

528
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,130
别人问起你的时候你再回话  女仆
Speak when spoken to, handmaiden.

529
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,920
黑魔法
Ohh! Dark magic!

530
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,030
我的眼睛
Ohh! My eyes!

531
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,900
你攻击的刺痛灼烧着我的灵魂
The stinging of your attack burns my very soul!

532
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,840
黑魔法
Dark magic?

533
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,600
真是白去了
Well, that was a bust.

534
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,750
你确定影兽人在那儿吗
You sure the Shadow Orcs are even out there?

535
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,620
对于一个女仆来说
For a handmaiden,

536
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,630
你实在问得太多了
you certainly ask many questions.

537
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,740
是  我确定
Yes, I am positive.

538
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,990
他们只是非常善于隐藏自己
They're just very good at hiding themselves.

539
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,270
但是我突然想起来一个
But a plan has sprung to mind

540
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,050
可以把暗影之王引出来的方法
that will draw the shadow king to us.

541
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,700
我们应该把影兽人关押起来
We shall take the shadow orc held in stock,

542
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,350
跟他做战俘交换
offer him up as a prisoner exchange.

543
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,040
把他引出来再打败他
Draw him out and beat him down.

544
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,720
我喜欢你的风格  波尔塔
I like your style, Boltar.

545
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,750
我去集合战俘
I shall retrieve the prisoner.

546
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,730
你去照顾女王的洗衣房和夜壶
You tend to the queen's laundry and chamber pots,

547
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,100
然后在这儿见
then meet me back here.

548
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,330
装备不错
Nice outfit.

549
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,890
你喜欢吗
You love it.

550
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,170
好吧  当你在玩角色扮演时
Right. Well, while you were, uh, playing dress-up,

551
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,280
我发现那标记是
I found out that the mark...

552
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,160
是影兽人的
Belongs to the Shadow Orcs.

553
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,770
是的  而且他们在使用精灵魔法
Yeah. And they're using fairy magic.

554
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,770
痛苦之树  太棒了
The tree of pain. Awesome.

555
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,220
凡是身上有标记的都遇袭了
Whoever gets marked gets ganked.

556
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,810
好吧  那我们怎么阻止它
All right, how do we stop it?

557
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,250
找出是谁施了咒语  把他除掉
Find whoever cast the spell, and take them out.

558
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,700
除掉咒语  就不再有标记
No more whammy, no more marks.

559
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,000
没有标记  就不会再有人遇害
No more marks, no more dead bodies.

560
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,980
好吧  很不错
Okay, well, perfect.

561
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,260
那个多嘴波尔塔

去找影兽人的战俘了

563
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,000
我们会进行一笔战俘交换
We're gonna do a little prisoner exchange,

564
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,880
把藏匿的暗影之王引出来
try to draw the king out of hiding.

565
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,420
其实是我的主意
It was my idea.

566
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,610
查理在哪儿
Where's Charlie?

567
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,430
她刚才和你在一起
She was with you.

568
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,840
没有  我让她去找你了
No, I sent her to you.

569
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,610
查理
Charlie?

570
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,760
陛下
Your highness?

571
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,230
查理
Charlie?

572
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,870
对了  她拿着我的手机
You know what -- she's got my phone.

573
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,520
打打看
Try it.

574
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,160
无信号

575
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,490
我是月女王
I'm the, uh, queen... of moons.

576

很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

577

00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,470
好吧

579

这真的是场不错的绑架
Well, this has been a really great kidnapping,

So, good talk.

真正的魔法
Wow. Real magic.

583
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,100
真的很酷  如果没这么恐怖的话
That is really cool, if not mostly terrifying.

584
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,040
好的
Okay.

585
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,160
我们可以把事解决掉的
We can work this out, can't we?

586
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,750
给你点黄金  或者我的王冠
Get you some gold, my crown.

587
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,430
再或者祭祀仪式
Ritualistic sacrifice?

588
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,830
我不是真的女王
Look, I am not really a queen.

589
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,900
我只是个搞计算机的女孩
I'm just an I.T. Girl...

590
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,500
站在一个怪物面前
Standing in front of a monster...

591
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,920
请求不要杀她
asking it not to kill her.

592
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,960
好吧
Great.

593
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,670
我人生最糟糕的时期结束了
Now the worst period of my life comes to an end.

594
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,030
我看见我的老板被利维坦吃了
I saw my boss get eaten by a leviathan,

595
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,880
摔坏了胳膊  四处奔波
broke my arm, lived life on the run,

596
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,430
好不容易恢复正常
finally got it all back,

597
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,090
现在一个带着颅骨面具的家伙又要杀了我
and now a dude in a stag-skull mask is gonna kill me.

598
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,120
我只是想找回以前的生活
I just want my old life back!

599
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,090
那也正是我想要的
That is all I want, as well.

600
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,180
我发誓  她要是有个三长两短

601
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,290
我们找过了所有的帐篷
Dude, we checked all the tents.

602
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,500
我们四处询问  一定会找到他的
We'll talk to these guys. We'll find her.

603
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,600
你们好  异教徒
Greetings, heretics.

604
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,600
你应该在我面前跪下
You should kneel before me, cur.

605
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,710
好吧  你干脆让我
All right, why don't you let me --

606
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,870
安静
Silence!

607
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,610
在我们做交换之前
Now, before we exchange,

608
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,310
说几条公告
a few announcements.

609

明天在一号场地
Um, there is a peewee-league soccer playoff game tomorrow

610
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,070
有一个迷你杯足球季后赛
on the alpha field.

611
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,150
我们不想惊吓那些现代人
We don't want to freak out the mundanes,

612
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,450
所以决定把场地改到二号场地
so we got to move the battle of kingdoms to the beta field.

613
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,080
好吧
All right. That's it.

614
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,760
我要用老方法解决问题
You know what? I'm gonna do this the old-fashioned way.

615
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,340
-迪恩  不要  -不行
- Dean, don't.  - No, I'm --

616
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,160
-我告诉你了  -闭嘴
- I told you there are... - Shut up.

617
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,910
我要真正的回答
All right. I need real answers.

618
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,110
这可是真枪  看见没
This here is a real gun, see?

619
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,350
告诉我  女王在哪儿
Now, start talking. Where's the queen?!

620
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,410
我不知道
I don't know!

621
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,210
你胸前的家族徽章
Yeah, well, your little family crest there

622
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,020
可不是这么说的  伙计
tells a different story, pal.

623
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,400
-这个  -对
- This? - Yeah.

624
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,090
上个月就在这个标记
Uh, I got sick last month

625
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,570
在我胳膊上出现后我就病了
after this thing just appeared on my arm.

626
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,320
我觉得这很酷
I thought it looked really cool,

627
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,430
就把它当做我的家族徽章了
so I turned it into my family crest.

628
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,630
我的皮肤医生说这不是恶性的
I mean, after my dermatologist said it wasn't malignant.

629
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,810
迪恩  他不是我们要找的人
Dean, he's not our guy.

630
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,660
他只是一名受害者
He's just another vic.

631
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,520
我叫马斯克・希尔比  我是名律师
My name is Max Hilby. I'm an attorney.

632
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,120
我不知道女王在哪
I have no idea where the queen is,

633
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,580
但如果你现在放我走  我不会起诉你
but if you let me go right now, I won't press charges.

634
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,430
我发誓
I promise.

635
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,940
还有这个  给你了
Here. Uh, take them. Please.

636
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,800
走吧
Go.

637
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,920
快走
Go! Go!

638
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,880
怎么了
What? What?!

639
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,140
女王真的遇到危险了吗
Is the queen really in danger?

640
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,620
我注意到小溪旁有一些奇怪的东西
Okay, look, I-I noticed something odd down by the creek.

641
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,740
有一顶奇怪的帐篷  不是我们的
It's this weird tent. It's not one of ours.

642
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,460
挺吓人的
It's kind of creepy.

643
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,400
你怎么一下子这么有用
Why are you being so helpful all of a sudden?

644
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,660
我喜欢上女王了
Look, I harbor an epic crush on the queen.

645
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,960
也许你们可以找到她时替我美言几句
Maybe you could put in a good word for me when you find her.

646
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,990
我觉得你不是她的口味
I don't think you're her type.

647
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,920
什么  你是说她不喜欢兽人
What? You mean she's not into orcs?

648
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,870
我叫吉尔达
My name is Gilda.

649
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,590
我来自阿克莫尔的神圣树林
I'm from the hollow forest of Arkhmoor.

650
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,310
我是一个仙女
I'm a fairy.

651
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,110
真好
Mm. Swoon.

652
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,700
我是说  你是怎么到这的
Uh, I mean, how did you get here?

653
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,790
我是被一条咒语召唤来的
I was summoned here by a spell.

654
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,280
被谁
By whom?

655
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,200
我不知道他的名字
I don't know his name,

656
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,190
但我是被招来服从他的命令的
But I was brought here to do his bidding.

657
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,430
他的命令  绝不是什么好事
His bidding? That's never good.

658
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,390
我的主人
My...master,

659
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,090
他让我伤害人们
he... he has me hurt people.

660
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,660
他逼迫我做的  否则我绝不会伤害任何人
He's forcing me to. I'd never hurt anyone.

661
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,840
我是一个仙女  善良的那种
I'm a fairy...the good kind.

662
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,890
我知道  他为什么这样
No, no, I get that. Why is he doing this?

663
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,600
我不知道
I don't know.

664
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,080
他开始时只下达一些小命令
He started off with smaller commands,

665
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,300
但他现在越来越暴力了
but he's become more violent.

666
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,370
这一周他让我杀了两个人
He had me kill two men this week.

667
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,160
老兄  有人把这个游戏看得太认真了
Man, someone is taking this game way too seriously.

668
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,280
游戏
Game?

669
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,930
就是这个  我的装备  这所有的
This -- my outfit, all of this --

670
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,530
这仅仅是个游戏
It's just a game here.

671
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,530
你们为什么要玩这个游戏
Why would you play such a game?

672
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,210
现实常常让人不爽
This world -- not so much with awesome.

673
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,700
玩这个游戏是为了逃避现实
The game is a way to get away.

674
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,120
这个森林很可爱
It's a lovely forest,

675
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,030
但跟我的家完全不同
but it's nothing like my home.

676
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,080
没错
Right.

677
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,870
那我们该怎么把你送回去呢
So, how do we get you back there?

678
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,330
我自己没法从咒语中解脱出来
I can't break free from the spell, myself.

679
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,720
必须有个英雄偷走我主人的魔法书
A hero must take my master's book of magic

680
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,650
毁掉它  破除咒语
and destroy it, breaking the spell.

681
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,940
吉尔达  我叫查理・布拉德布利
Gilda, my name is Charlie Bradbury,

682
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,400
我是来拯救你的
and I am here to rescue you.

683
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,300
你干嘛不离开  波尔蒂  我们自己去
Why don't you take off, Bolty? We got it from here.

684
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,620
一个女仆和一个时间旅行者拯救女王
A handmaiden and a time traveler rescue the queen?

685
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,880
我可不这么认为  善良的女士
I think not, kind lady.

686
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,440
听着  这可不是游戏  波尔塔
Look, this isn't a game, Boltar.

687
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,030
我们的朋友  这位女王  真的有危险
The queen, our friend, is in real danger.

688
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,750
你可能会受伤
You could get hurt.

689
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,170
我才不会置我的女王于危险而不顾
I will not leave my queen in peril.

690
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,770
看那边
Look there.

691
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,550
我们还没检查过那个帐篷
We haven't checked that tent.

692
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,970
伙计们
Dudes.

693
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,450
如果帐篷在抖  拜托别不敲门就跑进来
If the tent is rockin', don't come a-knockin'.

694
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,750
不  就是他  我的主人  快跑
No, it's him! My master! Run!

695
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,220
月门里可没有枪  先生们
No guns in moondoor, gentlemen.

696
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,030
吉尔达  来吧
Gilda, if you please?

697
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,290
好吧  现在你想怎样  杰里
Well, now what, Gerry?

698
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,230
我叫狂怒波尔塔
My name is Boltar the Furious!

699
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,350
我原本计划
My plan was,

700
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,300
摆脱所有的竞争者后
after getting rid of all of my competition,

701
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,010
明天赢得比赛
to win the battle tomorrow,

702
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,040
说服女王我应该做她的国王
convincing the queen that I should be her king.

703
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,630
结果你们两个白痴跑出来
But then you two idiots showed up,

704
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,160
我不得不见机行事
and I was forced to improvise.

705
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,470
将悲伤的少女从影兽人手中解救出来
Rescue the damsel in distress from Orcs,

706
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:34,120
当上国王  杀掉你俩  这样也行
become king, kill you both -- that'll work, too.

707
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,310
那你为什么要从弄瘸别人升级为谋杀
So why did you go from hobbling to murder?

708
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,360
灰狐狸和撒格瑞姆做了荣誉护卫
Greyfox and Thargrim became part of the honor guard.

709
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,810
他们接近了女王
They got close to the queen,

710
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,510
但他们是通过破坏规矩达成目的的
but they did it by breaking the rules --

711
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,760
真金白银贿赂其他选手
paying off other players with real money,

712
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,170
而不用月门的货币
rather than moondoor currency.

713
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,350
他们是在作弊
They were cheating.

714
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,170
哦  那用魔法就不算作弊了
Oh, and using magic isn't?

715
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,030
魔法是月门的一部分
Magic is a part of moondoor.

716
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,670
你是怎么回事
What is your problem?

717
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,640
为什么要伤害别人  这是个游戏而已
Why would you hurt people? This is just a game.

718
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,500
这不是什么游戏  只有月门
There is no game! There is only moondoor!

719
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,770
我来这里就是为了与众不同
I came here to be different,

720
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,600
逃离我的无聊人生  做个英雄
to get away from my crappy life, to be a hero.

721
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,630
知道吗
And guess what?

722
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,420
什么  你是个现实生活中的卢瑟
What, you were a loser in the real world,

723
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,370
你在这里照样是卢瑟  
and you're a loser here? Shocker.

724
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,190
卢瑟能够根据一本魔法书
Would a loser track down a real book of spells

725
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,390
强迫仙女服从他的命令吗
and compel a fairy to do his bidding?

726
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,420
说不准  你怎么拿到的
It depends. How'd you get it?

727
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,570
淘宝
eBay.

728
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,900
听我说
Look.

729
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,860
波尔塔  你没必要这样
It doesn't have to be like this, Boltar.

730
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,370
把魔法书交出来
Just hand over the book of spells.

731
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,870
我们来了结这件事情
We can work this out.

732
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,760
这事儿最终会了结的
This will all work out...

733
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,110
但是得等我把你们踢出去
after I remove you from the playing field

734
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,100
抹去她的记忆
and wipe her memory.

735
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,860
吉尔达
Gilda?

736
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,350
吉尔达  那个大个子
Gilda, the big one.

737
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,550
我没法阻止他
I can't stop him.

738
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,650
那本书  你必须毁掉它
The book -- you must destroy it.

739
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,080
你好  杰里
Hey, Gerry.

740
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,440
我才是解救悲伤少女的人
I'm the one who saves damsels in distress around here.

741
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,710
不
No!

742
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,410
你没事吧
Are you okay?

743
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:42,770
我从咒语中解放了  你救了我
I'm free of the spell. You saved me.

744
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,280
神圣森林永远都欠你的人情
The hollow forest is forever in your debt.

745
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,040
我现在必须回到那些绿山
I must return to those green hills now.

746
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,270
我还要把前主人带回去
I will take my former master with me.

747
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,030
他必须因自己的罪行面对仙女裁判所
He must face a fairy tribunal for his sins.

748
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,200
等等
Wait.

749
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,370
有可能的话给我打电话
Call me, maybe.

750
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,650
接下来你要去哪里  查理
So what's next for you, Charlie?

751
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,260
新的小镇  换个新身份
New town? New identity?

752
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,220
如果说这24小时教会了我什么
If the last 24 hours have taught me anything,

753
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,410
那就是逃避解决不了问题
It's that escaping isn't what it used to be.

754
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,480
我再也不会换身份了
No more replacement characters for me.

755
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,140
从现在起  我要面对现实
I got to face reality from now on.

756
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,790
痛苦的是  现实中真的有恶魔
Sadly, reality actually includes monsters,

757
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,050
你们接下来要去做什么
but what are you gonna do?

758
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,540
如果有什么能帮到你们的  尽管开口
If I can ever be of help to you guys, let me know.

759
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,850
一定会
Will do.

760
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,830
还有你  你没事吧
And you, uh... you're good?

761
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,630
你是说除了
apart from the fact

762
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,660
你阻碍我跟个仙女上床
that you blocked me from banging a fairy,

763
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,060
我即将会在战役中输掉王冠
and I'm about to go lose my crown in battle,

764
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,580
因为我的军队被消灭了

再见了  娘们儿

那么  接下来干什么
So, what's, uh... what's next?

768
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,860
一点儿都不好玩  对吧
'cause no fun, right?

769
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,930
在你开口之前我要说  我明白的
Look, before you say anything, I-I-I get it.

770
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,410
因为没有什么乐趣能够
No amount of fun is gonna help you

771
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,960
弥补你所放弃的
get over what you gave up.

772
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,430
你嘛  你需要时间  对吧
You just, uh... you need time, right?

你说得对
And you're right.

776
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,030
找乐子帮不了我
Having fun won't help me.

777
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,870
帮的是我们俩
It'll help both of us.

778
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,280
来吧
Shall we?

779
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,520
很多年后  当你在床上垂死挣扎时
And dying in your beds many years from now,

780
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,960
你愿意拿从今天开始到死之前那些日子
would you be willing to trade all the days,

781
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,700
来换一个机会
from this day to that, for one chance --

782
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,680
这话不是从那里...
Isn't that the speech from --

回到这里的机会
Just one chance to come back here

785
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:13,220
告诉我们的敌人  他们或许能够消灭肉体
and tell our enemies that they may take our lives,

786
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,240
但他们永远都夺取不了...
but they will never take...

787
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,440
停
Hold!

788
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,820
都是我的错
My bad.

789
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,790
抱歉  你没开玩笑吧
Sorry. You can't be serious.

790
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,800
我们的自由
