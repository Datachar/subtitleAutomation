9

So did you hear the buzz on the block?
(Turns on TV)

10
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:25,207
The new neighbors have finally moved into the Meenahan's house.
<i>(Tv playing indistinctly)</i>

11
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:27,451
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. I'm bringing these over

12
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:28,894
to welcome 'em
to the neighborhood.

13
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:30,306
You're bringing potato chips?

14
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,675
It doesn't matter
what you bring.

15
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:33,134
It's that
you brought something.

16
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:34,357
So you wanna come with me?

17
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:35,562
Not in any way.

18
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,306
Aw, come on.
It's the neighborly thing to do.

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,056
It'll give us a chance
to check out their stuff.

20
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:42,431
We already know
it's better than ours.

21
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:43,492
What's the point?

22
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:44,767
(Sighs and crunches)

23
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:49,816
Hey, mom.

24
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:51,678
I was just filling in
my dates for wrestlerettes.

25
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:53,434
If you thought I was
busy as a mascot,

26
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:56,500
- I am gonna get even busier
as a wrestlerette. - Mm-hmm.

27
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:58,191
Seriously. I'm gonna be
like one of those people

28
00:00:58,306 --> 00:01:00,135
who says they're crazy busy.

29
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:02,359
That's how busy
I'm gonna be. (Laughs)

30
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:07,073
Come on, Mike.
Last chance to go with me.

31
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:09,364
It's not like you're doing
anything important.

32
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:10,753
You know what? Hang on.

00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:19,450
Thanks, pal.
Tell 'em I said hi.

<i>(Sports game</i>

38
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:27,704
Hi. Frankie Heck.
We just live down the street.

39
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:29,778
You know, the house with all
the screaming coming out of it?

40
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:31,113
(Both laugh)

41
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:32,818
Anyway, it's just
a little something

42
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:34,198
from our home to yours.

43
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:34,973
Aw.

44
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:36,454
That is so sweet.

45
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:38,640
Colleen Webber. Get on in here.
It's cold out there.

46
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:41,057
Whoa. Looks like a lot
of the neighbors

47
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,224
have been stopping by.

48
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,930
Well, no.
Just one, actually.

49
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:45,585
Nancy Donahue.
Do you know her?

50
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,441
Uh, yeah.
I think I do.

51
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:48,644
(Men shouting) Oh!

52
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:49,898
- Come on!
- Unbelievable!

53
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:51,375
That's my husband. He's
watching the game

54
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:53,073
with a few guys he met at work.

55
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:55,723
Honey, Jeff!
Come meet the neighbor!

56
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:58,531
Hey. Sorry about
the noise.

57
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,802
- Hi. I'm Jeff.
- Hi. Jeff. Frankie Heck.

58
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:03,866
Hi. I'm gonna stare at you
for three seconds,

59
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,733
then I'll never forget
your name.

60
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:08,968
Locked and loaded.

61
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:10,559
He's amazing with names.

62
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:11,900
Thanks...

63
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:12,933
Rhonda, right?

64
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:14,352
(Frankie and Jeff laugh)

65
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:16,023
Hey, did you bring these,
Frankie?

66
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:19,480
Have to say, hands down,
best welcome gift we've gotten.

67
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:21,765
(Man) Jeff, we're down by 12.

68
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:23,050
Okay. I gotta get
back in there.

69
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,622
- All right. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

70
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:26,137
(Jeff) Lucky chips coming in.
<i>(Crowd cheers)</i>

71
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:27,110

72
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:28,022
Yeah!
(Laughs)

73
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:30,533
Gotta be the chips!
Thank Frankie!

74
00:02:30,645 --> 00:02:33,290

Frankie! Frankie!

75

00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,627
<i>Just so much fun.</i>

77
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,391
<i>And then I went back</i>
<i>to my house.</i>

78
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:42,628
Ugh. It's so depressing in here.
(Switch clicks)

79
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:44,950
A little light
wouldn't kill you, Mike.

80
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:46,851
You're not a bat.
(Curtain rings swoosh)

81
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:49,233
Hey. What are you doing?
It was fine in here.

82
00:02:49,355 --> 00:02:50,864
No, it was dank.

83
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:53,135
(Switch clicks) You know,
it was just so much fun

84
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,068
over at
the new neighbors' house.

85
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:56,652
There were these guys
watching the game,

86
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,670
and they were
all friendly and festive...

87
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:00,300
You didn't invite 'em over,
did you?

88
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,851
No, Mike. I didn't
invite anybody over.

89
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:03,860
<i>(Whistle blows)</i> Attagirl.

90
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:04,911
You know what?
Forget it.

91
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:06,499
Just sit here alone in the dark

92
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,173
and watch your TV.

93
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:09,621
(Exhales)

94
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:12,039
(Amplified voice)
And I can't believe

95
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:14,381
that I have to say this
for the second consecutive week,

96
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,925
but the bulletin board
outside of the main office

97
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:19,609
is for approved announcements
only.

98
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:21,253
Not pictures of your heinies.

99
00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:23,024
(Laughter) All right.

100
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:26,119
And now a message
from the cheerleaders.

101
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:28,012
(Girl) - All right, Courtney!
(Girl) - Go, Debbie!

102
00:03:28,144 --> 00:03:29,599
(Girls) Go, Hens!

103
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:31,862
So the Orson High
wrestling team,

104
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,526
which we never
really knew about,

105
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:36,399
is expected to do
super well this season,

106
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:39,305
and we're uber-pumped.
Aren't we, Deb?

107
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:40,725
We sure are, Court.

108
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,522
And it's sad, 'cause they don't
get the school spirit they need.

109
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:47,204
So we, the football
and basketball cheerleaders,

110
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,642
have decided to do
triple duty this year

111
00:03:49,765 --> 00:03:51,686
and be the wrestling
cheerleaders, too!

112
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,992
(Debbie and Courtney scream,
students cheer)

113
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:55,417
(Courtney) Say it with us!

114
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:58,255
(Both chanting)
Never give up! Never give in!

115
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:01,340
Thundering Hens
fight for that pin!

116
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:02,980
Mom!

117
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:06,376
Axl, get off your girlfriend
and take out the trash

118
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:08,591
like I already told you to
five times today.

119
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,265
Ugh. Okay.

120
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:12,078
Don't move a muscle.
(Chuckles)

121
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:15,619
(Sighs)

122
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:18,382
It's nice to finally
see your face.

123
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:20,453
I've really only seen
the back of your head before.

124
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:22,377
You have a very oblong head.

125
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:24,116
(Whispers) Oblong.

126
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:25,841
Hey. You're into
"Planet Nowhere"?

127
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:27,507
God, I spent so much time
reading those books,

128
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,014
my vision started to blur.

129
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,543
Really? You, too?
(Door closes)

130
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:31,482
Who's your favorite character?

131
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:32,501
- Soran!
- Soran!

132
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,102
So many people
prefer the Vernegos...

133
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:35,067
- Oh.
- but not me.

134
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:37,306
Brick! Go nerd out
somewhere else.

135
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:39,051
Silligan. Am I right?

136
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,481
(Laughs)

137
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:43,866
Silligan.

138
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:45,031
Ah.

139
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:47,195
Hey, Frankie!

140
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,197
Told you. Never forget.

141
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:51,730
Oh. You out getting some exercise?
(Laughs)

142
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,629
No. I was just returning
those casserole dishes

143
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:55,685
to the Donahues.

144
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,035
You didn't want that
paper plate back, did you?

145
00:04:58,152 --> 00:04:59,776
Oh, no.
That is our gift to you.

146
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,504
(Both laugh)

147
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:05,511
You know, Jeff,
this might sound weird,

148
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,219
but you're really friendly,

149
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,251
and my husband...
well, he's not always,

150
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:11,451
and I was just wondering

151
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:14,868
if maybe you could ask him
to hang out sometime.

152
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:15,993
Oh. Uh...

153
00:05:16,094 --> 00:05:18,066
I don't want to imply that
he doesn't have any friends.

154
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:19,845
It's just,
his dad is a recluse,

155
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:22,076
and Mike definitely
has those tendencies.

156
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:23,416
Not that he's gonna become one,

157
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:25,000
but you know,
in the back of my mind,

158
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:26,224
I worry about it.

159
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:29,436
Oh, he's also a hoarder.
Mike's dad is, not Mike.

160
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:30,433
Anyway...

161
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:32,941
Listen, Frankie
I've got one rule in life--

162
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:34,368
I'll have a beer with anyone.

163
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:37,808
(Indistinct conversations)

164
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:41,161
Courtney. Debbie.
We gotta talk.

165
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,811
Hi. Are you
our new transfer student?

166
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:45,344
Welcome to Orson High.

167
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,076
I am not a transfer student.

168
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:51,817
I'm Sue Heck. My brother is Axl?
You've talked to me at my house?

169
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,458
You know what? Doesn't matter.

170
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,369
Look, wrestlerettes
already exist,

171
00:05:56,485 --> 00:05:57,897
and that's <i>our</i> job.

172
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:00,280
We're the ones who cheer
for the wrestling team,

173
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:03,685
so your cheering services
will not be needed.

174
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:04,771
Court, what are wrestlerettes?

175
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,505
I don't know,
but it's a fun name.

176
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,085
- We should use it.
- No!

177
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:10,596
You can't use it
because I came up with it...

178
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:13,319
last year,
when I founded wrestlerettes.

179
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:15,285
Wait, I don't think "founded"
is a word, is it?

180
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:17,550
Mm, I think people
mostly say "found,"

181
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:18,873
like "lost and found."

182
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,027
Oh, is that
what you're looking for?

183
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,284
It's in the main office.

184
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,634
And totally feel free

185
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:25,524
to come watch us cheer
for the wrestlers.

186
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:27,551
And good luck
at lost and found.

187
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:41,858
(Telephone rings)

188
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,070
(Beep)

189
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:44,306
Hello?

190
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,012
Oh, hi!

191
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:47,052
Yeah, hang on.

192
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,357
Mike, it's for you.

193
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:50,746
It's never for me.
It's probably some solicitor.

194
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,692
It's not a solicitor.
It's Jeff, our new neighbor.

195
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:55,616
That's what they tell you
to get you on the phone.

196
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,573
Just hang up.

197
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:59,385
Mike, I'm pretty sure it's him.

198
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,019
Why is he calling <i>me?</i>

199
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,741
I don't know.
Just take it.

200
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:03,771
Find out what he wants.

201
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:05,242
I don't know what he wants.

202
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:06,611
(Lowered voice)
He can hear you.

203
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,566
Uh... hello?

204
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:13,634
(Camera shutter clicks) Axl?

205
00:07:13,752 --> 00:07:15,781
Shh. I'm talking
to my lady.

206
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:17,782
(Clicks) That doesn't
look like talking.

207
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,930
We're snapchatting.
It's for grown-ups.

208
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:22,133
You'll do it, too, in a few
years when you get a phone.

209
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:24,209
And then in a hundred years
when you get a girlfriend.

210
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:25,397
(Laughs) (Click)

211
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:26,657
Right.

212
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:28,336
Can I ask you something?

213
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,241
Do you ever worry that Cassidy
might get bored with you

214
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,710
if you don't share the keys
to a lasting relationship,

215
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:36,785
such as friendship
and intellectual stimulation?

216
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,041
Just thinking out loud.
(Click)

217
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:40,019
Ugh. Where'd you hear all that junk?
(Click)

218
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,496
At the library
in the dollar bin,

219
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:44,544
I picked up "Men Are From Mars,
Women Are From Venus."

220
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,154
Not actually a science fiction
book, as it turns out.

221
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,579
(Keypad clicking)
But it did talk a lot

222
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:50,760
about how a couple needs
to find common ground

223
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:52,408
to keep
the relationship strong.

224
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,397
Hey, we got plenty in common.

225
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:55,457
We both think I'm awesome.

226
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,145
Now just shut up. I gotta say
good night to my girlfriend.

227
00:07:58,824 --> 00:07:59,979
(Camera shutter clicks)

228
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:01,770
See you then.
(Beep)

229
00:08:02,134 --> 00:08:03,313
So?

230
00:08:03,993 --> 00:08:05,125
(Bottles rattle) So?

231
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,465
What was that about?

232
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,052
Uh, he asked me
to watch the game with him.

233
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:10,278
(Cap fizzes) I said fine.
That was it.

234
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:11,961
Ooh. Where you gonna go?

235
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:13,067
I don't know.

236
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,367
Well, is it gonna be
a full dinner,

237
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,575
or is it just drinks
and light snacks?

238
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:18,178
It's not a wedding, Frankie.

239
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:20,494
Well, okay.
That sounds super.

240
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:22,739
Let me know if you need help
picking out an outfit.

241
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:26,457
- Oh! What a shot.
- Mm.

242
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:27,689
<i>(Man on TV) 41 to 44!</i>

243
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:29,111
You must have played
back in the day.

244
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:31,290
I haven't played in a while.
My knee.

245
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:33,209
You still have
your original knee?

246
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:35,181
I'm like 50% titanium.

247
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:36,591
Sucks gettin' old, doesn't it?

248
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:37,703
Yeah, I hear you.

249
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:39,557
Sometimes I have to pee
<i>while</i> I'm peeing. (Laughs)

250
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:41,240
<i>Good!</i>
<i>(Cheering)</i>

251
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,235
Tied it up.

252
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:44,182
- Nice shot.
- Yes.

253
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:45,238
Sorry, pulled
my right shoulder.

254
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:46,168
I gotta go left.

255
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:48,532
Oh, that's a no-go for me.
Tweaked my back.

256
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:50,317
- Ooh. - What do you say we just
sit and drink more beer?

257
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:52,051
- That sounds good.
- All right.

258
00:08:56,784 --> 00:08:57,710
Hold on a sec.

259
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,121
(Chuckles) I, uh...

260
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:02,369
(Inhales) thought maybe
we could have a conversation.

261
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:06,217
Thought maybe we could, uh,
you know, <i>con-verse.</i>

262
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:07,728
Oh. Okay.

263
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:09,776
What do you wanna
"con-verse" about?

264
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:12,388
Well, uh, I thought
you could start,

265
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:13,401
'cause, you know, I was the one

266
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,211
that came up with the idea
of talking. (Laughs)

267
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,067
(Clicks tongue) Okay.

268
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:23,172
Uh, I'll start. Hey,
you going to the pep rally?

269
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,180
Uh, no. Why would I?

270
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,544
Come on, Axl.
I had two AP tests today.

271
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,326
I don't feel like talking.
I hope that's cool.

272
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:33,930
Yeah. Pfft. (Chuckles)
Totally cool, yeah.

273
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:38,222
<i>Yep, Brick had gotten</i>
<i>into Axl's head,</i>

274
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:40,673
<i>just like Sue had to do</i>
<i>with her wrestlerettes.</i>

275
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:43,159
Okay. I know you all saw
the assembly the other day,

276
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,890
and I am sure you had
the same reaction I did.

277
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:47,377
Yeah, the cheerleaders
were really good.

278
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:49,610
No. Weren't you listening?

279
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:52,030
The cheerleaders are
stealing wrestlerettes from us.

280
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:53,965
You guys, we have to
do something about this.

281
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,323
That sounds like
it could take a while.

282
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:57,952
This is the night
I usually bury things

283
00:09:58,091 --> 00:09:59,409
I found during the week.

284
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,732
Oh, I could sew together
a spirit quilt

285
00:10:01,854 --> 00:10:02,691
for the cheerleaders,

286
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:04,395
to bless them
in their endeavors.

287
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:07,858
No. We're not burying anything,
and we are not blessing anyone.

288
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:09,666
We built wrestlerettes
from the ground up,

289
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:12,840
and we gotta fight for it.
Who's with me?

290
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,179
Wait.
We're-- we're gonna fight?

291
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,131
'Cause I got a sock full of
old batteries in my locker.

292
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:17,250
I call the blonde one.

293
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,640
Becky!

294
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,496
So... my house
for the next one?

295
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:25,883
You got it.
(Laughs)

296
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:28,317
(Seat belt latch clicks) All right.
I'll see you around.

297
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:29,377
Thanks. It was fun.

298
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:30,709
Don't thank me.
Thank your wife.

299
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:32,445
She's the one that suggested it.
(Closes door)

300
00:10:33,496 --> 00:10:34,777
Suggested what?

301
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,530
You know, us getting together.

302
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,259
Uh-huh?

303
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,127
Yeah, she said you were shy.

304
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:42,048
You're not shy.
If anything, you talk too much.

305
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:43,981
(Laughs) I'm just kiddin'.

306
00:10:44,262 --> 00:10:45,234
Have a good one.

307
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,863
(Shifts gears)
Yeah. Will do.

308
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:51,529
(Door opens)

309
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,169
Hi. How'd it go?
(Door closes)

310
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:55,305
Did you ask Jeff
to hang out with me?

311
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:57,552
What? No.

312
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,887
I mean, I ran into him outside
when I got the mail.

313
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:02,209
That's a "yes."
That's a Frankie "yes."

314
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:04,213
(Sighs) What happened?

315
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:05,936
Did-- did you have a bad time?

316
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:08,519
- I had a fine time.
- Hey, you had a fine time.

317
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,892
That's great. So you guys
getting together again?

318
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:12,561
- Nope.
- Well, why not?

319
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:15,720
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe 'cause I'm shy.

320
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:16,933
Okay, listen...

321
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:18,843
You telling guys I'm shy?

322
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:21,671
First off,
you don't use that word.

323
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:23,859
And if anything,
it's "stoic."

324
00:11:23,972 --> 00:11:25,799
Mike, it's not like I'm going
around talking about you.

325
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,768
I only said
you were... stoic

326
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:31,122
as to how it related
to your dad.

327
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:33,158
W-what are you doing
talking about my dad?

328
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:35,572
I don't know, just how you
can be sort of like him,

329
00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:37,620
and how he hardly leaves
the house and he's a hoarder,

330
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:39,779
- and he--
- Are you out of your mind?

331
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:41,673
Mike, who cares?
If you had a good time,

332
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,591
what does it matter
how you and Jeff got together?

333
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,201
Because I'm a grown man!

334
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,893
Your wife doesn't call
other grown men

335
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:49,442
and ask them to take you out.
It's weird.

336
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:50,986
Yeah, but you weren't doing it.

337
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:52,900
I'm not 5, Frankie.

338
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:55,024
I don't need you to set up
playdates for me.

339
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:56,473
I have friends, okay?

340
00:11:56,587 --> 00:11:57,380
And I told him that.

341
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,530
- I totally told him you have friends.
- Aah!

342
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:02,273
Mike, I'm sorry. I thought
you two would like each other.

343
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:04,356
Even Nancy Donahue thought
it would be a good idea

344
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:05,560

345
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:06,916
You talked to Nancy Donahue
about me.

346
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:08,532
That's it. We're movin'.

347
00:12:08,664 --> 00:12:11,538
Look, it doesn't matter
how you and Jeff met.

348
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,540
The point is, you can't let
pride stand in the way

349
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,248
of what could be
a great friendship.

350
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:18,278
Frankie, no more talking
about me to anybody.

351
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:20,237
Period. Got it?

352
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:22,069
(Door creaks)

353
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:25,626
(Frankie) Can I at least
tell Nancy it went well?

354
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:32,686
(Door creaks)

355
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:36,311
I need you to teach me stuff
so I can talk to people.

356
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,977
It's Cassidy, isn't it?

357
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:40,075
You're feeling
intellectually inferior.

358
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:41,412
No.

359
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:45,933
But if you must know,
I feel she's smarter than me.

360
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:48,896
Ah.
I knew this day would come--

361
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:52,305
a day I'd become more to you
than something to Indian burn,

362
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:55,323
whip a towel at,
or force to smell your farts.

363
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,745
Just shut up and help me.

364
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,002
(Thud)

365
00:12:58,316 --> 00:12:59,922
Now you don't need
to know all of them.

366
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:01,130
Just pick one.

367
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,575
That way,
if someone talks to you

368
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:05,092
about a particular artist,
you respond by saying,

369
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,824
"that's interesting
that you like this artist,

370
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:08,526
but I like... blank."

371
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,209
Hmm. Great. Perfect.

372
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:11,852
Now just show me
this Blank dude's stuff,

373
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:14,210
and let's kick art's sorry ass.
Ha ha!

374
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,926
JD Salinger's famous book
on teen angst

375
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,553
is called
"Catcher In The..."

376
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:19,637
"Rye."

377
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:21,181
(Crunching)

378
00:13:21,273 --> 00:13:23,349
The character Atticus Finch
is from the book...

379
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:24,697
"To Kill A Mockingbird."

380
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,047
F. Scott Fitzgerald's
most famous novel

381
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:29,023
is entitled "The Great..."

382
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:30,486
- "Escape."
- No.

383
00:13:30,598 --> 00:13:31,506
Ugh. "Train Robbery."

384
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:32,608
Sorry. (Crunching)

385
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:33,950
Uh... the "Pumpkin,
Charlie Brown."

386
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:34,989
Wait. Wait.

387
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,639
"Gatsby."
"Great Gatsby."

388
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,735
(Laughs)

389
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,947
(Resumes crunching)
Whoo! Ha! I win!

390
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,724
<i>Well, Axl might have been</i>
<i>feeling victorious,</i>

391
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:45,652
<i>but I was feeling a
little guilty.</i> (Beeping)

392
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:48,305
<i>I'd overstepped my bounds,</i>
<i>and I knew I had to fix things.</i>

393
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:51,656
Hi, Jeff? It's Frankie,
your new neighbor.

394
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:54,787
Yeah, hi.
So here's the thing--

395
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:57,135
Mike had a really good time
the other night,

396
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,971
and I know he would love
to do it again,

397
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:01,331
but he's not exactly the type
to pick up the phone.

398
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,916
Not that he's socially awkward.
He has friends.

399
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,907
So if I didn't make
that clear before, he does.

400
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:09,916
But he also has that loner DNA

401
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,611
I mean, you should
meet his brother.

402
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:13,909
The guy lived in a tent
for a year.

403
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:17,765
But <i>anyway,</i> if you wanted
to ask him out again,

404
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:19,183
that would be great.

405
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:21,503
But he was a little hinky that
I asked you in the first place,

406
00:14:21,616 --> 00:14:23,087
so if you talk to him,

407
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:26,288
maybe you don't mention
that I call...

408
00:14:26,862 --> 00:14:28,585
Okay. Talk later. Bye.
(Beep)

409
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,411
Have you lost your mind?

410
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,967
(Amplified voice) And that's why
you should always wear socks.

411
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:38,775
Okay, students, please put
your hands together

412
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:41,874
for something we've never had
at this school before.

413
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:44,428
Hmm? Wrestling cheerleaders!

414
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:47,643
(Cheering)

415
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,380
Not so fast.

416
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:06,713
Uh, what are you doing here?

417
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:09,573
What we are doing here
is fighting for wrestlerettes,

418
00:15:09,765 --> 00:15:11,345
which <i>I</i> founded.

419
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,785
Yeah, <i>founded.</i>
It's a word. Look it up.

420
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,878
- I don't get it. Do you get it, Deb?
- No, I don't.

421
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:19,914
How about we let
the school decide

422
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:21,683
who gets to cheer
for the wrestlers?

423
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:25,100
Oh, that's right.
Time to bring it on.

424
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,672
(Both) Oh, my God.
It's a cheer-off!

425
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,241
It's a cheer-off! Whoo!
(Cheering)

426
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:40,568
(Marching band playing)

427
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,473

(Door closes)

433
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:08,062
Why wouldn't I be here?

434
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,644
'Cause the pep rally
is going on.

435
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,890
And if everybody's
not suitably peppy,

436
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,350
there's no way
we'll take down Roosevelt.

437
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,956
Eh, I don't wanna be there.

438
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:20,313
I wanna be here,
because art is awesome.

439
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:23,732
(Laughs)
Ooh. Like what you're doing.

440
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:26,526
Sort of reminds me of, uh,
Van Gogh's "Starry Night,"

441
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,654
which he actually painted
from memory during the day.

442
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:33,146
So... uh, did you know Van Gogh
did his most famous paintings

443
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:34,690
the last two years of his life?

444
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,335
Also, "To Kill A Mockingbird"
is a significant book.

445
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:38,541
I could talk about that
for hours.

446
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:39,989
I can also talk about
"Catcher In The Rye,"

447
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:41,322
but not for as long.

448
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:44,037
Okay. What's going on here?

449
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,375
(Sighs)

450
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,221
I don't know.
(Chuckles)

451
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:49,908
Um, doesn't it bother you

452
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,768
we don't have
deep conversations and stuff?

453
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:55,185
Not really.

454
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,594
Guess I never thought about it.

455
00:16:56,706 --> 00:16:58,161
Does it bother you?

456
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:00,008
Well...

457
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,799
yeah. (Chuckles)

458
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:02,845
Kinda.

459
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:06,417
I... I know what's
going on in here,

460
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:07,547
but I don't always say it.

461
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,203
You know, I don't always
express it.

462
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:11,570
And before,
I never really cared,

463
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,978
but when you start, like...
falling for somebody...

464
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:19,484
I just want to make sure
that you see

465
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,078
there's more to me than...

466
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,144
you know, everybody else sees.

467
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:27,247
That's
a pretty deep thought, Axl.

468
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:28,995
Oh, yeah?

469
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:31,038
Yeah. I like it.

470
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,111
You like my thought, huh?
My thought turn you on?

471
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,021
Oh, yeah.

472
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,119
How about
I give you another one?

473
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:37,138
I'd like another one.

474
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:38,642

518
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,771
<i>I stepped over the line
with Jeff.</i> (Beeping)

519
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:47,425
<i>So I did what I should have</i>
<i>done right from the beginning--</i>

520
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:48,851
<i>I called his wife.</i>

521
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:50,945
Hi, Colleen,
it's Frankie, your neighbor.

522
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,421
I hope you don't mind me leaving
a message on your cell,

523
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:56,578
but, well,
I was a bit of a dope,

524
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:58,742
and I called Jeff
so he would call Mike again,

525
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,036
and Mike found out.

526
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:02,149
And I promised him
I wouldn't call Jeff again.

527
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:05,338
So that's why
I'm reaching out to you,

528
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:07,309
just wife-to-wife.
'Cause it would be silly

529
00:20:07,426 --> 00:20:09,557
if they didn't get together
because of what <i>I</i> did.

530
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:12,565
So if you could tell your
husband to just call my husband

531
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:13,675
so they could grab
another beer,

532
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:15,586
that would be great.
<i>(Voice mail beeps)</i>

533
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:17,721
Hi. It's Frankie
calling back real quick.

534
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:19,028
Now that I thought about it,

535
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:20,886
maybe don't tell Jeff
I called you,

536
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,587
'cause that might be weird.

537
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,151
<i>(Beep)</i>
Hi. Frankie again.

538
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:25,888
You know how I said
in the last message

539
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:27,340
not to tell Jeff I called you?

540
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,243
I realized I shouldn't ask you
to lie to your husband.

541
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,208
So however you wanna
handle it amongst yourselves

542
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:35,212
is your business,
but how 'bout no one tell Mike?

543
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,638
(Laughs) Just let's none of us
tell Mike, okay?

544
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:38,389
<i>(Beep)</i>

545
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:39,301
Sorry to call back again,

546
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,603
but I just wanna be
super-duper clear.

547
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:41,814
'Cause you don't really know me,

548
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:43,717
and I don't want you to think
I keep secrets from my husband.

549
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,801
'Cause I don't.
We have a very good marriage.

550
00:20:45,897 --> 00:20:47,125
I mean,
everybody has their problems.

551
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,952
But I mean, it's good.
No, it's solid.

552
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:51,262
<i>(Beep)</i> I feel like I'm
starting to sound crazy.

553
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:52,565
But someone who knows
they're crazy

554
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,944
isn't really crazy, right?
Like Hitler.

555
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,064
<i>(Beep)</i> Oh, God, I just
realized I mentioned Hitler,

556
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:58,558
and that's <i>really</i> inappropriate.

557
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,009
I don't even know
if you're Jewish.

558
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:02,238
Doesn't matter.
Hitler's horrible for everybody.

559
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,392
You know what?
Let's just start over.

560
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:06,815
You can tell Jeff
whatever you want...

561
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:08,483
<i>Well, it's no surprise</i>
<i>that we didn't see</i>

562
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,261
<i>our new neighbors much</i>
<i>after that.</i>

563
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:13,262
<i>Although we did see them</i>
<i>briefly the other day.</i>

564
00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:21,368
<i>I don't know. Maybe it's true--</i>

565
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:23,127
<i>I can't leave</i>
<i>well enough alone.</i>

566
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,838
<i>But I like to think</i>
<i>I'm striving for excellence</i>

567
00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:27,319
<i>in a family of settlers.</i>

568
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,418
<i>Sometimes you succeeed
and sometimes you don't.</i>

569
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,530
<i>You know, I'm glad we didn't
become friends with them.</i>

570
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:33,828
<i>They're weird.</i>

571
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:36,144
<i>Yeah. They're
definitely weird.</i>
