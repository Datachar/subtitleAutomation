00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,325
Some guys just can't
take "no" for an answer.

3
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:11,494
The Morrigan wants that photo!

4
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:13,730
Oh, I can't blame her.
Have you seen it?

5
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:14,396
Awkward!

6
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:28,744
Kenzi for the assist!
Yes!

7
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:32,130
Did you like that part? Where
I pretended to fall on my ass

8
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:35,215
when actually I was like a stealth
missile lasering in on target.

9
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:38,019
Smooth. Remind me
to book you on "Dancing With The Fae".

10
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:39,219
Is that a thing?

11
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:42,189
Just help me drag tall, dark
and hideous out of sight, okay?

12
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:45,492
You know, far be it from me
to be a Wendy Whiner...

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,861
Totally.

14
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:49,228
But this is the third
Faebag attack this week.

15
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:50,664
Your point, Wendy?

16
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:54,034
Yesterday it was the two-headed
thingie that looked like Regis.

17
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:55,869
Then before that it
was that hotdog vendor

18
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:57,737
that turned out to be
a fire- breathing...?

19
00:00:57,805 --> 00:01:00,206
- I wanna say, frog?
- Jellyfish?

20
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:02,341
Whatever it was, we
kicked its gelatinous ass.

21
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:06,885
You know, I never thought I'd
say this, but I'm only human, Bo.

22
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:09,815
And, no offense, but you ain't
lookin' so chipper either.

23
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:12,785
Hey, whatever the Morrigan
dishes out, I can handle it.

24
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:15,420
You still got that doozie
from yesterday's slug fest?

25
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:17,089
Yesterday it was a cut.

26
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:18,957
Today it is a bruise.
I'm healing.

27
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:21,726
- Slowly. Very slowly.
- What are you saying?

28
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:24,062
The doc...
I mean...

29
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:26,230
you know, isn't it like
trying to charge an iPad

30
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:29,100
- with a hamster wheel?
- Okay, time out.

31
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:31,135
What exactly do you have against Lauren?

32
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,269
<i>Moi?</i>

33
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:35,539
Oh, come on, Kenzi, with the little
digs and the rolling of the eyes...

34
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:37,741
- I'm not stupid.
- Well...

35
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,043
Here's your chance, while I'm still high

36
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:42,679
off my wicked moves.
Get it out of your system!

37
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:46,349
She is bossy, territorial,
and controlling.

38
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:49,086
She thinks you're immature,
irresponsible and clingy.

39
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:50,286
She does!?

40
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:51,922
Oh, you've said those
things about yourself.

41
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,289
Yeah, but when I say it, it is adorable.

42
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:56,792
Okay, the point is I love Lauren.

43
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,895
She's a huge part of my life.
As are you.

44
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:02,431
So in the Battle of
BFF versus Main Squeeze,

45
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:05,701
I think it's time we called a truce.
Got it?

46
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:09,237
Uh huh.

47
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:13,374
Now, all those on Team Bo...
drinks are on me.

48
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:19,914
That's right...

49
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,551
Oh, Bruce... you disappoint me.

50
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,719
- I'm Steve...
- How did this happen?

51
00:02:25,787 --> 00:02:30,624
- It's not my fault, she had an army.
- Don't insult my intelligence!

52
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,692
You're a worse liar
than your brother, Eric.

53
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:34,862
- Dave.
- I don't care!

54
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:36,663
If I hadn't just had my nails done,

55
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:38,766
I'd rip your beating heart out myself.

56
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,334
You're too kind.

57
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:50,743
I think someone's getting a little
too big for her leather britches.

58
00:02:56,683 --> 00:02:59,885
Soon, my pet... soon.

59
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,996
If Li'l Bo Bleep thinks she
can play in the big leagues...

60
00:03:11,063 --> 00:03:12,764
let the games begin.

00:03:22,307 --> 00:03:25,009
<i>My love carries a death sentence.</i>

00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:29,879

EKG, MRI, EMV...

70
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:50,098
Wake me up when you get to S&M.

71
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:53,769
See, the truth of it, Vex, is that...

72
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:58,040
No, don't sugar coat it, Doc.
Just give it to me straight.

73
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:01,376
Okay... there is nothing
physically wrong with your arm,

74
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:03,945
or your nervous system, or
your musculoskeletal system...

75
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:08,650
Then...
why... can't I...

76
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:11,386
- Get it up?
- Oh, regular riot, you are.

77
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:14,255
Since there's no physiological
reason for your mesmeric impotence...

78
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:15,690
Aha! I made you do that!

79
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:19,460
- No, actually, that was just an itch.
- Damn you!

80
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,595
What I'm trying to say
is that your "condition"

81
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:24,465
may be psychological in nature.

82
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,032
What, you sayin' I'm whacked?

83
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,902
Like I'm a nutter?
A few ounces short of a pint?

84
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,505
It's not at all
uncommon in Fae your age.

85
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:34,240
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?

86
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:39,379
You shall feel the wrath of Vex!

87
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,753
Why aren't you strangling
yourself by now?!

88
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,654
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
I actually have the pamphlet...

89
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,156
Oh, save your pathetic bedside manner

90
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:55,761
for your new, presumably
temporary, girlfriend!

91
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:58,963
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on... it can't be easy

92
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:01,466
keepin' up with the
Energizer SuccuBunny.

93
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,868
Though Dyson could.

94
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,036
Okay... you know what?
I think we're done.

95
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,837
Any chance of a prescription refill?

96
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:09,407
- Out!
- Really?

97
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,346
Bloody physicians.

98
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:19,717
I mean, imagine sayin' that
there's nothing wrong with it.

99
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,719
I mean, have you ever
heard anything so...

100
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:24,888
Hello! Barkeep!
I'm talking to you!

101
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:28,225
- Still?
- Unbelievable!

102
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:30,427
Here I am, pouring out
my heart to you and...

103
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,667
Ok Dyson, I'm not here for my health.

104
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,936
You wanna look at
these case files or not?

105
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:41,270
Uh, absolutely.
Just gimme a sec...

106
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:43,773
Ah... greetings.

107
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,109
- Don't even start, Vex.
- I beg your pardon?

108
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:50,513
- I'm not buying you another drink.
- Hey, I'm deeply offended.

109
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:53,215
- Good, now go away.
- Hey, you don't own me.

110
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:54,583
<i>Okay, look...</i>

111
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,585
we've been listening to
your same sad story for days.

112
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:59,087
The Dark doesn't want me.
The Light can't stand me.

113
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:00,756
My friends...
Oh, wait...

114
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:02,157
he doesn't have any, does he?

115
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:04,927
- Sucks to be Vex.
- This is an outrage!

116
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:07,496
Nine ball... side pocket.

117
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:23,444
What is it with that chick?

118
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:24,846
She's just not feeling the love.

119
00:06:24,913 --> 00:06:27,447
- But why?
- Because she thinks you're a murderer?

120
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:30,049
But more importantly,
what have you been up to?

121
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,184
What? Oh...

122
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:33,854
- The Morrigan again?
- Oh, piece of cake.

123
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:35,054
Don't underestimate that woman.

124
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:36,556
After the Garuda meltdown, the Light

125
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:38,625
and the Dark have agreed to play nice.

126
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:40,293
Unaligned means unprotected.

127
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:41,928
Oh, but you are forgetting...

128
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:44,797
I have this.

129
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,967
My own little insurance policy.

130
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:50,303
I still think you
should talk to The Ash.

131
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:52,305
You look like you could use a break.

132
00:06:52,373 --> 00:06:54,007
And I'm guessing Kenzi could, too.

133
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:55,674
Ow!

134
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:56,942
<i>Pardonez moi...</i>

135
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:01,046
- What's his problem?
- I have no idea.

136
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:03,648
You brought this on yourself, you know.

137
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:05,617
Is this how you roll now?
Tough love?

138
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:08,586
You handcuffed the Morrigan
to her bed for a Kodak moment.

139
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:12,424
You sure this has nothing to do with
your Fae United Nations experiment?

140
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:15,359
A Light cop partnered
with a Dark cop? Really?

141
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:17,728
It's cynicism like
that has kept our sides

142
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:19,530
from building a genuine peace.

143
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:22,066
Also, why do you care
who Dyson is paired with?

144
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:24,435
- I don't.
- Didn't think so.

145
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,837
Know what might help your situation?

146
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,741
Just so happens I had a declaration
to the Light all prepared...

147
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:33,876
I'm not gonna be pressured into
choosing a side out of fear.

148
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:35,778
Well, can't blame an Ash for tryin'.

149
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:39,249
You know what? Forget it.
I can handle the shitstorm,

150
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:41,651
it's just that Kenzi is
starting to feel the strain.

151
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:43,420
Now who's dishing out tough love?

152
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,289
Bo, hang on...

153
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,659
Look, since we got all Garuda-fied,

154
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:53,328
I've been doing some serious
inventory of the archives.

155
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:54,663
And... ?

156
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,730
Seems someone has grabbed
my Staff of Righteousness.

157
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:58,866
The Staff is a piece of wood...

158
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:03,104
a treasured ceremonial relic ...
and very powerful.

159
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,005
Currently believed to
be in the possession

160
00:08:05,074 --> 00:08:07,908
of one Mortimer Fassbinder.
Pawnbroker and sleazebag.

161
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:09,677
So, if I bring you this Staff...

162
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:12,345
I could probably post a
security detail near your place.

163
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:15,048
Keep an eye out for The Morrigan's pets.

164
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,884
- Where do I find this Fassbinder?
- Hold up, Slick...

165
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:22,155
There's something you
should know about the Staff.

166
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:28,627
Cheers, Bruce!

167
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:32,331
Lovely lady, it is your lucky day.

168
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,967
I could have you killed just
for crossing my threshold.

169
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:37,336
Tut tut, bygones and all that...

170
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:42,007
A heartfelt expression of my
loyalty to the Dark. And you.

171
00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:47,678
I am beautiful in restraints.

172
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:50,081
Delete...

173
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:58,889
- Was there something else?
- Well, I thought you'd be pleased.

174
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:01,558
If you really wanted to
please me you would have

175
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,494
brought me that bitch's
head on a platter.

176
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:05,061
But... but, I...

177
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:10,066
But maybe your recent bout of
impotence has spread to your spine?

178
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:14,605
Lucky for you, my pity
outweighs my disgust.

179
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,907
I won't have you killed.
At least not today.

180
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:22,211
Oh... you're too kind.

181
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:25,281
We all have our cross to bear.

182
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:27,416
Now drink up and go.

183
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,053
The next time we meet...

184
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:36,324
...either Bo or you will be dead.
The choice is yours.

185
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:46,359
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

186
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:48,327
Whatcha doin'?

187
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,831
Oh, you know, just some
Doctor-y stuff.

188
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,934
You know, I am actually
interested in your work.

189
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:57,669
You can talk to me about
whatever it is you do.

190
00:09:57,737 --> 00:10:00,406
Really? You want to hear
about my latest monograph

191
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:03,292
regarding the rhizome repellent
gradient of Fae blood compared

192
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:06,111
with human blood, especially when
suspended in an isotonic solution?

193
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:09,681
- Or we could go to a movie.
- Okay.

194
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:12,517
- What is that?
- Oh...

195
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:18,623
- The Staff of Righteousness.
- The who of what?

196
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,358
Don't ask.
Oh, and don't touch.

197
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:25,696
Well...
what can I touch?

198
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:29,265
Haha, very funny.

199
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:38,174
What's gotten into you?

200
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:39,743
Well, you know, nothing just yet.

201
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:42,345
But I was kinda thinking
maybe we could, um...

202
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:47,750
Oh... wow...
and to think I just came by

203
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:49,785
to see if I left my phone here.

204
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:52,922
Hmm... I don't know.
Let's look...

205
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:57,626
Well, it's not in there.
Gosh, you know,

206
00:10:57,694 --> 00:11:00,161
with any luck maybe you
left it on "vibrate".

207
00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:02,630
I thought you'd be too
tired after last night.

208
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:06,267
Tired? I am going for the
gold in the Succu-games.

209
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:11,272
Well...
I don't know what's gotten into you,

210
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,976
but far be it from me to stand in
the way of a young athlete's dream.

211
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:26,119
- Yo, V-man.
- Whatever.

212
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,888
Sounds like somebody
woke up on the wrong side

213
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:30,524
of the pull-out couch this morning.
What's up?

214
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:35,227
- It's my arm.
- Again with the pity parade?

215
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,463
Look, you got a busted
wing, you can't fly.

216
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,033
You gotta walk around like the
rest of us poor miserable humans.

217
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,235
Welcome to Kenzi-ville!
Man!

218
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,571
Now you know what it's
like to be surrounded

219
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,507
by superheroes every day.
Suck it up, Pathetico!

220
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,810
You know, if I were you, I'd
re-consider a career in social work.

221
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,445
Can we just...

222
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,615
...forget about your Fae-self
for like a nanosecond,

223
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,650
and talk about something
that's really important?

224
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,885
Doubtful.

225
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,054
- Mascara.
- You have my attention.

226
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,723
Dude, your lashes are freakin' amazing!

227
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,492
Yeah...
it's all in the brush technique. Wait...

228
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,829
I picked up a few tips from Da Vinci.

229
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,198
- As in The Code?
- Oh, yeah, now there was a queen for ya.

230
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,668
He was all over David's
ass like curry on chips.

231
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,403
- Can you help me with my clumping?
- Oh, please...

232
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,303
<i>Hey, y'all.</i>

233
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,839
Hey... Whazat?

234
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:25,642
The end of a long story, involving

235
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,611
a greasy pawnbroker and
some hardcore negotiating.

236
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,813
<i>Uh, do you mind?
We're working over here.</i>

237
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:31,881
Anyone seen my phone?

238
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:33,583
You say phone?
What, your phone?

239
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:37,285
Here, shift a cheek so I can
look under the cushions...

240
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:41,857
Nothing...

241
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:44,593
- Scootch!
- Where'd you last have it?

242
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:47,228
That's the thing...
I coulda sworn that I left it...

243
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:50,398
Yeah, iPads, iPhones electricity...
it's all just a fad, really.

244
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:53,067
The future's analog and all that.
I'm tellin' ya.

245
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:01,408
Am I doing it right?

246
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:04,045
Hmm...
just a little bit up...

247
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:06,146
O.M.G.

248
00:13:07,382 --> 00:13:09,415
You guys are so cute together.

249
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:14,054
I wish I had a makeup buddy.

250
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:18,257
I thought she could be my friend,
and she doesn't even like me.

251
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:20,259
- Who?
- Tamsin!

252
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:23,963
She is so mean girl, right?

253
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:26,799
I mean, buy an actual
personality already.

254
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:29,134
Did you happen to rifle
through my duffel bag,

255
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:32,104
and scarf down a couple of
yellow pills with tigers on 'em?

256
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,673
I'm gonna talk to Dyson.

257
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:40,712
And Bee-Tee-Dubs...
It is "trés" private.

258
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:43,547
Private?

259
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:47,885
Lauren's pelt is gonna be steamed!

260
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,654
What's it with you and the Doc?

261
00:13:49,722 --> 00:13:51,355
I mean, besides her
terrible bedside manner

262
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:54,025
and the fact that she's a
damn sight cleverer than you.

263
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:57,628
Not to mention sneaky.
She spy-banged Bo.

264
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:59,830
Dyson's drop-kicked Bo's
heart ten times over,

265
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:02,365
and you still howl
when he comes 'round.

266
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:04,300
I...! No!

267
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,505
Listen, are you gonna teach me

268
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:11,241
the double pump smudge-proof
technique or not?

269
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:14,710
I'm so proud of you.
Come here...

270
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:19,749
Alright, you're gonna move
it like this just at the ends.

271
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:21,617
You can't... like shake it...

272
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,354
I do not like your friend.

273
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:27,889
She's not my friend.
She is my new partner.

274
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:32,861
What is she saying about me?
Because whatever it is, it's not true.

275
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:34,896
- Have you been drinking?
- What? Like, alcohol?

276
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:36,865
I wish.

277
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,171
- Do you have fake ID?
- What?

278
00:14:44,673 --> 00:14:46,473
Let's do it.

279
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:51,578
Let's get faced!

280
00:14:51,646 --> 00:14:54,113
Okay, you are cut off.
I'm gonna talk to Trick.

281
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,992
Wow, you're so beautiful.

282
00:15:11,431 --> 00:15:12,331
I'm sorry...

283
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,966
I gotta go...

284
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:27,712
- I think Dyson likes me.
- Say what?

285
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,282
Don't tell anyone this...
but I think I might kiss him!

286
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,004
There's no pupil dilation...

287
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:48,541
no concussion...

288
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:51,209
I'm stumped.

289
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:53,946
You have little specks in
your eyes that look like stars.

290
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:55,447
Call me crazy, but based on

291
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:56,948
your little display at the bar...

292
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:59,250
I mean, I do know that you and Dyson...

293
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:01,152
Spill on aisle 3!
Spill on aisle 3!

294
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:02,219
Ow, ow...

295
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,755
Come on! Let's go to a movie.

296
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:06,223
Wow, you're really hot.
Have you ever kissed a girl?

297
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,260
I need you to sit still
to check your EKG, ok?

298
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:10,962
- Bzzz!
- Bo, stop!

299
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:13,397
We have now swapped brains.

300
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:17,168
Hi, I'm Dr. Lauren.
I don't like to have any fun.

301
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:19,636
Take two frownie brownies
and call me in the morning.

302
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:21,105
You're really starting to scare me.

303
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:22,806
Okay Bo... just listen to me...

304
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,009
Bo! Listen to me...

305
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:27,211
have you come in contact with
any strange Fae lately...?

306
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,612
- This is so lame!
- Bo! Please!

307
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,048
Okay, well...

308
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,918
there was this one gross
guy with a magic stick...

309
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:47,463
Hey, Tammers.
"T-sin". Officer "Slamsin"!

310
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:51,500
- Okay...
- Are you playin' with yourself?

311
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:53,202
Did somebody spike your brewski?

312
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,105
Dude... this one time?
That totally happened.

313
00:16:56,172 --> 00:16:58,807
I got to be Kenzi.
Nailed it.

314
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:03,744
Right... if you're trying
to throw me off my game

315
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:05,579
before we get down, it's working.

316
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,719
- Do you think Bo likes me?
- Do I look like I care?

317
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:14,222
I think I'm gonna ask her on a date.

318
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:16,423
Okay, well...
knock yourself out.

319
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:20,627
In the meantime...
you're either in the game...

320
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:27,834
- or you are in my way...
- You are so badass.

321
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:36,608
Bo and Dyson sitting in a tree...!

322
00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:38,077
Shhhh!

323
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:40,279
K-i-s-s-i-n-g!

324
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:43,782
Oh, that would be so awesome!
But, shhh! People are listening.

325
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:51,389
- Hey, Gramps, what's this?
- Seventh century.

326
00:17:51,457 --> 00:17:53,058
Please, put it back in my study.

327
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,993
- Ew, she's gross.
- Just put it back.

328
00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:58,729
"Put it back."
Can I have the car keys?

329
00:17:58,797 --> 00:17:59,630
No.

330
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:05,302
If I don't get the car keys,
I'm gonna count to a hundred.

331
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,670
In French .

332
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:09,406
- Good grief...
- See what I mean?

333
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:09,973
<i>Un.</i>

334
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:12,142
<i>Deux!</i>

335
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:15,479
<i>Trois...</i>

336
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:21,417
You think this is being caused by
the job that The Ash sent her on?

337
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:22,351
<i>Quatre...</i>

338
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:23,419
You tell me.

339
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:24,520
<i>Quatre...</i>

340
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,223
Can the Staff of Righteousness
have symptoms like these?

341
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,258
<i>- Quatre...!
- Cinq!</i>

342
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:33,129
- For the love of Aphrodite, it's cinq!
- Sorry, French Police.

343
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,330
Cinq.

344
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,598
Six...

345
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,401
At first glance, there's
nothing in the lore

346
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:41,603
that suggest the Staff
is causing her symptoms.

347
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,938
You have to admit, it's a
pretty strange coincidence.

348
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:46,808
She goes looking for the
Staff and comes back like...

349
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,410
- Pollyanna on mushrooms?
- Exactly.

350
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:50,845
- Hey...
- What?

351
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:51,679
Where's "seven"?

352
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:03,157
Bo, get down!

353
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,058
"Don't you wish you're..."

354
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:08,394
Hey! Let me finish!
Don't Kanye me.

355
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:12,098
<i>- You are a cheater!
- Whatever!</i>

356
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,699
You're a cheater.
And you're getting a zit.

357
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:18,171
Bo is right.
You're mean!

358
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:24,076
Whatever this is... it's contagious.

359
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:31,316
...you gotta forget about brown...
black is always the new black.

360
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:36,188
- You can't ground us.
- Yeah. You're not our Mom.

361
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:38,457
Yeah, we don't even
have to listen to you.

362
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:40,224
So... Bo shagged them both daft?

363
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:43,361
- We have a situation.
- More like a SHITuation.

364
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:44,828
You guys wanna see my room?

365
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:46,897
- Uh... yeah!
- Shotgun!

366
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:49,167
- No! No!
- No, wait! Wait!

367
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,805
Something's made them sick.
And what's worse is the...

368
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:02,078
- Is that...?
- A pig...?

369
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:04,847
He's looking for something...

370
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,851
Or someone! Bo...

371
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:11,854
Kenzi, where is there a knife?
Or your trunk?

372
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:14,056
- Uh, upstairs!
- Well, what about your sword??

373
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:16,458
- Up... stairs!
- Okay, well, Kenzi, think of something!

374
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:17,793
<i>That's usually your thing, Doc!</i>

375
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:21,129
This little piggy's
about to go to market!

376
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:38,179
We need a weapon!
We need something!

377
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:39,980
Whoa!

378
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,490
Bloody hell...

379
00:20:52,493 --> 00:20:55,295
That'll do, pig...
that'll do.

380
00:20:55,496 --> 00:20:56,496
How did you...

381
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,498
I...

382
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:04,503
Aren't you the dark horse.

383
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:13,912
He's dead.

384
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:17,249
Dudes, all I did was grab
this stupid shillelagh

385
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:20,417
and all of a sudden I'm
Darth Vader.

386
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:23,955
- Let me see that...
- Yeah, about that...

387
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:27,825
the shaft is kinda...
Fae-zy Glued to my hand.

388
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:30,461
Yeah...
That happened to me once.

389
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:31,362
Painful.

390
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:36,675
"Grab a weapon," she said.

391
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:39,912
It seems to be an energy bond.

392
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,948
- So un-bond it.
- I can't.

393
00:21:42,782 --> 00:21:44,616
The wood is melded to your flesh.

394
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:46,552
Worst hand job ever.

395
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:48,787
Whoa, Mack! The knife!?

396
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:51,456
No, I saw it on TV.
It cuts right through wood.

397
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:52,890
And tomatoes.

398
00:21:56,162 --> 00:21:58,596
Not my bad.
Stick bad.

399
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,602
Plus...
your music sucks!

400
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,937
<i>I bought that one ironically.</i>

401
00:22:07,672 --> 00:22:09,139
<i>All of them, actually...</i>

402
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:13,677
- Um, what the heck is this?
- Oh! Look at that!

403
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:15,846
What is with your voice?
It's all Scottish-y.

404
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:17,547
Oh! Well, do you like it?

405
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:18,248
<i>It's lame.</i>

406
00:22:18,316 --> 00:22:20,917
- No.
- Yo, peeps! We are under attack!

407
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:24,854
- Big whoop.
- Fascinating.

408
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:26,822
They seem to be immune
to any sense of danger.

409
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,125
Ohforgodsakes...
Hey!

410
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:31,995
We have a dead man-pig
in the living room,

411
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:34,097
I have a tree stuck to my mitt,

412
00:22:34,164 --> 00:22:36,599
and I did not sign up
for the babysitter's club!

413
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,001
Oh, Dyson touched my boob!

414
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:41,203
That was an accident!
It was with my elbow!

415
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,404
Doesn't even count!
Come on!

416
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:43,571
Seriously?

417
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:45,740
Guys, guys, guys!
Let's order pizza!

418
00:22:45,808 --> 00:22:47,042
Yes.

419
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,877
For some reason, only the
3 of them are infected.

420
00:22:48,944 --> 00:22:50,445
Let's not take any chances.

421
00:22:50,513 --> 00:22:52,714
No physical contact until I
know what we're dealing with.

422
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:54,548
- Got it.
- Double cheese! Yeah!

423
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,218
Double cheese!
Pizza!

424
00:22:57,285 --> 00:22:58,919
- Pizza!!!
- Pizza!

425
00:22:58,987 --> 00:23:00,754
And you three, stay put.

426
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:02,089
<i>Get the pizza!</i>

427
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:03,824
Where did you get these??

428
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:07,728
- It's fantastic!
- Give it to me...

429
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:08,762
Totally lame...

430
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,364
Aww... There's another one!
Come here, you!

431
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:15,135
What I don't understand is that
if this disease only targets Fae...

432
00:23:15,202 --> 00:23:16,669
Why isn't Vex infected?

433
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:19,039
Well, perhaps my superior genetic makeup

434
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,941
has rendered me immune to
embarrassing afflictions.

435
00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:25,511
- What is that?
- What?

436
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:29,881
You have a strange
pustule behind your ear

437
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:31,983
that wasn't there when
I examined you last.

438
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:33,985
Pustule...
Ew.

439
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:42,160
Ugh...
Ugh! UGH!

440
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:43,861
Ewww with a double side of hurl.

441
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:47,831
- What is it??
- It's what's left of a cocoon.

442
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:49,534
You've been used as an incubator.

443
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,569
- By what?
- My guess?

444
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:55,639
- A parasite.
- What? I'm unclean?!

445
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:58,575
Relax... it isn't in you anymore.

446
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:00,477
But where could you have picked this up?

447
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,879
Have you been with
any strange Fae lately?

448
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:06,349
Damn bitch!

449
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:07,950
- What's that?
- What's that?

450
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:09,652
Oh, nothing, uh...

451
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,822
I was just saying how devastated
I was about all this, uh...

452
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,958
Listen, I'm gonna get some
help from Trick. Alright?

453
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:17,826
I'm gonna make things right.
Alright?

454
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:28,270
- What the hell did you do to me!?
- Used you to spread a parasite.

455
00:24:28,338 --> 00:24:31,239
- What kind of bloody parasite!?
- The parasitic kind.

456
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,576
Zaps its victims
with nymphoid hormones.

457
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:38,279
Turns them into self-obsessed
brats too young for Fae powers.

458
00:24:38,347 --> 00:24:40,348
So, they're completely
vulnerable to attack?

459
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,382
Precisely.

460
00:24:43,185 --> 00:24:46,520
But what about the "other
white meat"? Relatives of yours?

461
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:51,791
The infected emit a pungent
pheromone that attracts

462
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,628
a nasty breed of
UnderFae in for the kill.

463
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:57,764
Yeah, well, luckily Kenzi
pounded little Piggly Wiggly

464
00:24:57,765 --> 00:25:00,834
into UnderFae bacon with
her magic shillelagh.

465
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:03,669
- And the Succubitch?
- Still alive and singing.

466
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:07,906
Along with the other Twi-hards.
Dyson and his new partner.

467
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:11,910
Oh!
Now this is getting interesting.

468
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:17,249
Three of my favorite people,
trapped in one place...

469
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,784
with no way to defend themselves.

470
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,687
<i>And she's got The Ash's play stick.</i>

471
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,326
You want to prove your
loyalty to the Dark?

472
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,599
Finish off the teen trio, and
bring me the Staff of Righteousness.

473
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,702
And if I do?

474
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,005
I'm sure I could find some...
entry level position...

475
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:45,109
No! I want all titles restored ...
a million in cash

476
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:50,547
- and my club. I want it back.
- There's the Vex I remember.

477
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,252
"Grab a weapon", she said...

478
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,322
For the hundredth time,
Kenzi, I didn't know!

479
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,425
Alert the media, there is something
Doctor Flawless doesn't know!

480
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,061
This is hardly the time, Kenzi.

481
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:06,595
Course it isn't...
'Cause that would be "messy"!

482
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:10,232
Do you think just once!
Maybe just once, you could try to be...

483
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,401
- What? What??
- Helpful!

484
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:14,336
- Excuse me?
- Sure!

485
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:16,105
Because everybody else does!

486
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:18,925
You just bounce through life,
no job, no plan, from one beer

487
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:21,677
to the next and still, everybody
dotes on you, don't they?

488
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:23,311
What do you care where they dote?

489
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:25,814
- Just forget about it...
- Yeah... what is that?!

490
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:27,749
Why are you always
rolling your eyes at me,

491
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:30,551
with your normal upbringing
and your medical degree.

492
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:32,787
You don't know anything
about my life, Kenzi!

493
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:34,989
I know you think you're
too good for me...

494
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:39,826
No, I don't actually!
You think that I'm good enough for Bo!

495
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:48,501
- She's my best friend.
- And I love her.

496
00:26:49,003 --> 00:26:52,439
I know! I know.

497
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,510
Are you sure we're not infected?

498
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:05,017
No.
We're just...

499
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:06,119
...stupid.

500
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:10,956
Well, I prefer...
..."emotional".

501
00:27:17,096 --> 00:27:17,963
Moving on?

502
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:21,366
- Killer Pig?
- Yeah...

503
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:23,635
Yep, okay...

504
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:30,507
I can't believe I ever
thought you didn't like me.

505
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,878
I don't think I was
supposed to like you.

506
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,413
Why? What do you mean?

507
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:39,216
<i> I'm a Valkyrie.</i>

508
00:27:41,753 --> 00:27:44,053
- I think.
- Wow...

509
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:46,256
Really?

510
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:50,927
- What's a Valkyrie?
- I don't know.

511
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,782
But...
sometimes when I like people,

512
00:27:55,783 --> 00:27:57,066
I have to make them go away.

513
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,902
- What are you talking about?
- Can you keep a secret?

514
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:07,776
Till I die.

515
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:14,449
- No, I'm not supposed to.
- No, wait! Wait!

516
00:28:17,586 --> 00:28:20,587
I have an idea! Okay...

517
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:26,527
Let's write down our
deepest, darkest secrets...

518
00:28:26,594 --> 00:28:27,894
...in poetry.

519
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,563
Cool!

520
00:28:30,198 --> 00:28:32,399
But like real poetry.
The kind that rhymes.

521
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:36,703
You're really awesome.

522
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:41,240
No.
You're really awesome.

523
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:47,913
Um...

524
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:49,515
Oh, oh!

525
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:53,585
See its snout?

526
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:55,721
It's similar in genetic
makeup to the pig.

527
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:58,523
It was scenting out its
prey, it knew which of us

528
00:28:58,591 --> 00:28:59,725
was infected with the parasite.

529
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:01,259
Hurray for the Truffle Pig.

530
00:29:01,327 --> 00:29:04,062
These creatures travel in packs.
When their buddy doesn't return...

531
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:05,397
They'll all go hog wild?

532
00:29:05,465 --> 00:29:08,298
Not even my wonder whacker
may be enough to save us.

533
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:11,034
That's why we need Bo and
the others back to normal.

534
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:13,604
Based on the secretions
that I pulled from the cocoon

535
00:29:13,672 --> 00:29:16,073
from Vex, I think I can
cobble together an anti-toxin

536
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,377
- for the parasite. But I need time.
- And a lab, maybe?

537
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:23,580
Well, not necessarily.
I've got a few basic supplies in my kit.

538
00:29:23,647 --> 00:29:25,915
But I need you to gather
up some ingredients.

539
00:29:25,983 --> 00:29:28,451
Uh, baking powder, vinegar, turmeric...

540
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,552
Yeah, yeah, okay...

541
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:31,921
Alright, go...

542
00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:35,057
Also, garlic, hairspray,
and lubricating oil.

543
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,493
Flavoured or bulk?

544
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:40,596
As for me...
I'm going upstairs to take a swab.

545
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:42,131
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

546
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:45,234
Doc, you goin' in solo?
Without backup?

547
00:29:45,302 --> 00:29:49,438
- I think I can do this.
- You're as stubborn as you are bossy.

548
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:52,474
Godspeed.

549
00:29:57,313 --> 00:29:57,979
Okay!

550
00:30:04,153 --> 00:30:07,655
- What happened?
- I don't want to talk about it.

551
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:11,159
But... I got it.

552
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:13,427
Sure did.

553
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:15,829
Wow...

554
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:20,500
- Nice job.
- Yeah, I did something else too...

555
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:24,238
I set up an early warning
system outside, Home Alone style.

556
00:30:24,306 --> 00:30:26,540
Good. That'll help.

557
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:29,208
Okay...

558
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:31,610
You must've gone to some
crazy-ass medical school.

559
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:35,748
Yale taught me chemistry and physiology.

560
00:30:35,816 --> 00:30:40,019
But this kind of stuff is
just experience and luck

561
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:43,222
and whatever I figured out in the field.

562
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,890
- "Field" meaning...
- Afghanistan.

563
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,626
Shit, dude...

564
00:30:49,462 --> 00:30:52,230
- How long?
- Long enough.

565
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:57,735
- Why didn't you ever say so?
- You never asked.

566
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:07,744
You're listening to Dyson take a whiz.

567
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:09,146
I am not.

568
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:14,218
Did you read my poem?
It was stupid, right?

569
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:17,753
No, I liked it.
A lot.

570
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:22,025
Yours was really beautiful...
in a way.

571
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,562
But it was...
really, really sad.

572
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:30,766
I wish there was something
I could do to help you.

573
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:32,667
You can't help me.

574
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:35,437
Nobody can.

575
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:39,241
Our secret?

576
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,811
Cross my heart.

577
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:01,929
Make mine a Fae-cuccino, please...

578
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:05,432
I'm just straining any
impurities. God, I hope...

579
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:08,168
Perimeter breach!

580
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:14,874
- Uh... we've got company!
- How many?

581
00:32:14,942 --> 00:32:17,411
There's just...
Uh, no, there's another one...

582
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,746
- Ugh, it's not ready!
- Oh, God...

583
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:30,656
The 3 little piggies are back!
And this time, it's personal.

584
00:32:31,124 --> 00:32:33,325
- Vex!
- Dude, what are you doing?

585
00:32:33,393 --> 00:32:34,560
I'm going home.

586
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:47,002
- You slimy sonuvabitch!
- Ooooh!

587
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,137
Your words are like tiny
little daggers in my heart!

588
00:32:49,205 --> 00:32:50,271
I trusted you!

589
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:53,641
Yeah, well, just give us the
rugrats so we can all go home!

590
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,077
Not on your miserable life!

591
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:03,918
Duran Duran?

592
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:09,656
<i>♪ "...I'm on the hunt, I'm after you..." ♪</i>

593
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,693
<i>♪ "...I'm lost and I'm found..." ♪</i>

594
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,529
<i>♪ "...and I'm hungry like the wolf..." ♪</i>

595
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,702
<i>Bo! Help!</i>

596
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,837
That sounds like Kenzi!

597
00:33:29,643 --> 00:33:32,277
"...I'm hungry like the wolf!"

598
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:34,813
Bo?!

599
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,521
- Crank it, Tammy!
- Okay!

600
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,663
The antidote's ready!

601
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,667
- I need to get upstairs...
- Go long and wide, Doc!

602
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:58,301
I got you covered!

603
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:00,570
Are you gonna be okay??

604
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,577
Sure! This is kinda fun.

605
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:10,246
Okay...
Way to not overthink it.

606
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:19,155
Hey... Twinkle toes...

607
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:21,724
I'll be havin' that wee Staff of yours.

608
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:25,327
Come closer.
Let me give it you.

609
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:28,597
Oh, I'd be delighted.
Look what I found.

610
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,433
This isn't really like...

611
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:34,502
any Spin The Bottle game
I ever played.

612
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,739
- Oh, it's new rules.
- Are you sure?

613
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:41,375
Absolutely, I read it...
somewhere. It's your turn.

614
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:50,017
- I gotta kiss you.
- Okay.

615
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:03,863
- Man... what are you?
- Dude... that was all you.

616
00:35:03,931 --> 00:35:05,497
Are you playing Spin The Bottle?

617
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,466
That was so dope.

618
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:10,102
- Let's do that again.
- Okay.

619
00:35:10,436 --> 00:35:11,069
Yeah, let's not...

620
00:35:11,938 --> 00:35:13,138
Ow!!!

621
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:16,541
- Hey, where's our pizza?
- There's no pizza coming.

622
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:19,010
Come here, you little...

623
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:24,348
I believe "wanker" is the
word that you're looking for.

624
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:26,550
<i>A dirty traitor!</i>

625
00:35:27,485 --> 00:35:30,821
And to think I shared my limited
edition purple-pixie glitter with you!

626
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:33,924
Aw, you think sharing
makeup makes us friends?

627
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:37,327
Don't do this...
I thought you were your own man.

628
00:35:37,395 --> 00:35:40,396
I am my own man!
And I happen to have an axe.

629
00:35:40,464 --> 00:35:42,165
But you're not doing this for you.

630
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:43,967
You're doing it for that
stupid bitch!

631
00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:45,468
Anything is better than this!

632
00:35:46,336 --> 00:35:49,305
I mean, look at me!
I'm sleeping on a couch!

633
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:51,507
People are laughing at me to my face!

634
00:35:51,575 --> 00:35:53,009
You can't believe that The Morrigan's

635
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:55,078
just gonna welcome you
back with open arms!

636
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:56,912
Listen, luv, you've
obviously read the book

637
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,914
on "Hostage Negotiation 101"...
Can we just skip

638
00:35:58,982 --> 00:36:01,516
to the bit where you tell
me I'm better than this?

639
00:36:01,584 --> 00:36:03,685
- You are.
- What if I'm not?

640
00:36:03,753 --> 00:36:07,022
Losing your powers was the best
thing that could have happened to you.

641
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,225
I feel like I've
finally met the real Vex!

642
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:14,195
He's a true artist.
He's a gentle soul!

643
00:36:14,263 --> 00:36:17,399
And he will not be trifled with.
Not even by her!

644
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,000
He's done with that!

645
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:25,840
Vex... please!

646
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:32,446
Oh, Kenzi...

647
00:36:34,115 --> 00:36:36,016
I'm getting soft in my old age.

648
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:39,286
Good choice...

649
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:40,721
<i>Good choice!!!</i>

650
00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:48,695
It's all right...

651
00:36:50,163 --> 00:36:51,197
She's coming...

652
00:36:55,736 --> 00:36:57,804
Time for Mama
to bring home the bacon.

653
00:37:01,474 --> 00:37:03,308
I don't think I'd mind
getting my ass kicked

654
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:05,310
- by someone that hot.
- That had to hurt.

655
00:37:06,346 --> 00:37:08,213
Oh! God!

656
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,415
One to go, one to go,
one one one to go!

657
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:11,916
And that's two!
No, that's two!

658
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:13,151
Bo for the gold!

659
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:17,388
Ahem...
Uh, all's well that ends well, yeah?

660
00:37:17,456 --> 00:37:18,656
No hard feelings?

661
00:37:23,294 --> 00:37:24,328
<i>Ow!</i>

662
00:37:24,396 --> 00:37:26,530
Girl, you got you some
gaaame. True.

663
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:32,635
Come on, Bo...

664
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:35,772
The whole thing's... blank.

665
00:37:38,843 --> 00:37:41,444
But fuzzy, like...

666
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:44,180
...like there's something there,
but why can't I remember?

667
00:37:45,215 --> 00:37:48,717
Because you're not supposed to.
We're probably better off this way.

668
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:50,185
Yeah, good call, Tammy.

669
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:55,991
- I mean, Tamsin.
- Okay!

670
00:37:56,058 --> 00:37:59,495
Look, all I know is
that this latest crapfest

671
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:01,663
just caused a whole
mess of Fae paperwork.

672
00:38:01,731 --> 00:38:05,132
So, thank you for destroying
my weekend, and goodbye.

673
00:38:08,904 --> 00:38:11,606
Well, that girl is just no fun at all.

674
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:41,133
The one who touches the
Staff of Righteousness

675
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,168
shall take up the noble cause,

676
00:38:43,236 --> 00:38:45,971
accept the sacred mantle
of Ruler of Forest Nymphs

677
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:49,141
and Wood Sprites,
and fight for truth and justice

678
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:52,444
throughout the land to the
end of their natural days.

679
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:54,446
You're kidding me.

680
00:38:54,513 --> 00:38:56,280
This is a huge responsibility
you've taken on.

681
00:38:56,348 --> 00:38:58,950
I just picked up a frikkin' stick!

682
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:02,153
That's how destiny works.
One day you're you, and the next day...

683
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,588
I'm a superhero.

684
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:08,292
Pro...

685
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:11,261
I could be awesome, forever.

686
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:14,164
- Yup.
- Okay... Con...

687
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:17,367
I would have to learn
how to do everything

688
00:39:17,435 --> 00:39:20,070
with my left hand and I mean everything.

689
00:39:20,137 --> 00:39:24,608
Well... as a last, desperate
resort there is an escape clause.

690
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:26,742
Sold.
Show me the eject button.

691
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:28,345
Very well.

692
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:35,986
Close your eyes and say
the words... No peeking.

693
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:39,755
"I decline".

694
00:39:44,361 --> 00:39:46,561
I... decline.

695
00:39:53,203 --> 00:39:54,336
It was that easy?

696
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:58,139
Why didn't you just say so?

697
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:01,109
What? A Blood King
can't have a little fun?

698
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:11,529
I don't think much of
your interior decorator...

699
00:40:11,597 --> 00:40:13,198
It's a work in progress.

700
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,867
Much like yourself.

701
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:19,270
Don't change the subject.
You're not off the hook yet.

702
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:22,206
Oh! Look at you.
All grown up. "The Ash."

703
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:25,442
Did you get the new business cards, yet?
Maybe a little vanity plate?

704
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:28,311
- Daddy must be so proud.
- You violated Fae law.

705
00:40:28,379 --> 00:40:30,881
Oh, by having a little fun with SuccuBo?

706
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:32,983
You executed a blatant
attack on the Light.

707
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:36,953
Oh, come on now.
When did everyone get so uptight?

708
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,587
I remember the good old days.

709
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:41,791
A little raping, a little pillaging,
the odd "collateral damage"...

710
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:45,394
and then you'd have yourself a party.
Now it's all rules, rules, rules.

711
00:40:45,462 --> 00:40:48,364
Your actions may have
jeopardized the new peace plan.

712
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:50,733
A plan, in case you've forgotten,

713
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:53,434
that was endorsed by the
Fae Elders themselves.

714
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:55,937
What can I say?

715
00:40:56,939 --> 00:40:59,975
Except, mea culpa.

716
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:02,844
I was just trying to spice
things up a little bit.

717
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:05,280
I was a cop for thirty years.

718
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,985
One thing I learned...
bullshit stinks.

719
00:41:12,187 --> 00:41:13,553
And lady, you reek.

720
00:41:14,923 --> 00:41:16,857
You ever pull a stunt like this again,

721
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:20,861
I will personally rip off your head
and shove it up your lily white ass.

722
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:24,930
This détente is too important
to be screwed up by some petty feud.

723
00:41:26,366 --> 00:41:27,400
Am I clear?

724
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,403
Crystal.

725
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:38,744
Hey man, we are just one
Vex short of a real fiesta.

726
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:41,246
Where you goin'?

727
00:41:42,215 --> 00:41:43,182
I don't know yet.

728
00:41:44,951 --> 00:41:46,518
Why don't I go make some tea.

729
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,555
Vexster... hey!
Come on, all is forgiven.

730
00:41:50,623 --> 00:41:52,224
But it shouldn't be, Kenz.

731
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,659
I can't stay here.
Not after what I've done.

732
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:55,893
Dude, you saved my life...

733
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:59,530
Or that pig shifted to the left
at just the right moment.

734
00:42:00,432 --> 00:42:02,265
That is not true.

735
00:42:04,902 --> 00:42:05,768
Is it??

736
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:08,872
You know...

737
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:13,210
if you'd looked at my history
you'd know I was a betting man.

738
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:17,547
I'm going to take some
time to reflect, you know?

739
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:21,384
Reset the system.
I guess the Doctor was right!

740
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:23,519
Bloody humans...

741
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:30,660
- You thinkin' maybe Tibet?
- India, via Vegas.

742
00:42:30,728 --> 00:42:34,163
You know, the whole
Eat, Pray, Mesmer tour.

743
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,635
Yeah... well...
I'll be back.

744
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,571
Fully armed and ready to rock.

745
00:42:43,806 --> 00:42:45,907
How do I know I'll ever see you again?

746
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,921
Not your ebony handled
bison bristle blush brush?

747
00:43:03,558 --> 00:43:05,359
<i>You break that brush and I'll kill ya.</i>

748
00:43:05,427 --> 00:43:06,426
<i>Ow!</i>

749
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:12,832
<i>Catch you in another lifetime!
Maybe...</i>

750
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,872
I'm gonna miss that a-hole...

751
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:21,608
I know.

752
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:23,108
- Ow...
- Here...

753
00:43:29,015 --> 00:43:32,348
