黑帮医生 前情提要
<i>Previously on The Mob Doctor</font>

2
00:00:02,246 --> 00:00:04,195
只要你还在芝加哥，你就欠我的
As long as you are in Chicago I own you,

3
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:05,063
一言为定
that's the deal.

4
00:00:05,183 --> 00:00:07,155
郊区应该归我们管
Downtown should be ours.

5
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:10,182
我们在创造历史，最好别站错队伍
We're about to make history here.Better be on the right side of it.

6
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,488
郊区太抢眼了
Downtown is too high-profile.

7
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:14,611
我说了，我不感兴趣
Like I said, I ain't interested.

8
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,183
你想知道什么？
What do you want to know?

9
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:17,295
是不是你杀了我爸爸？
Did you kill my dad?

10
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:18,431
我跟你发誓
I swear to you,

11
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,322
以我的性命和你妈的性命发誓
on my life,on your mother's life,

12
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:21,858
我没杀你爸爸
I did not kill your father.

13
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:23,710
关于那天晚上你都知道些什么？
You know something? At the end of the day,

14
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:24,952
我和老康
me and Constantine...

15
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:26,820
首先我们都是父亲
we're fathers first.

16
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:27,888
老康还有个孩子？
Constantine has kids?

17
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:29,423
你谁呀？
Who the hell is this guy?

18
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:30,958
好久不见了
It's been a long time.

19
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:32,760
我对人脸有过目不忘的能耐
I never forget a face.

20
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:34,591
你走近点好好看看
Then look closer.

21
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:37,714
是我呀，爸爸
It's me, Dad.

22
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:36,047
见到你真好，卢克
It's good to see you, Luke.

23
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:40,733
我在监狱里的时候听说你妈妈去世了
I heard about your mom's passing when I was in the joint.

24
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,610
我非常的抱歉
I'm very sorry.

25
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,448
是吗？我猜你的吊唁卡一定让邮局给弄丢了
Yeah? I guess your condolence card was lost in the mail.

26
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:51,943
我们都25年没见面了
Well... we haven't seen each other in 25 years.

27
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:57,281
你需要什么？
What do you need?

28
00:01:57,315 --> 00:02:00,659
哦，我惹了个麻烦
Um, I'm in trouble.

29
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:02,194
我就说么
That I figured.

30
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:06,133
我的不动产大部分都在
I'm in real estate down in Miami...

31
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,943
迈阿密的南部海滩
South Beach, mostly.

32
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:10,347
我想我应该在房市低迷的时候购入
I figured I should go big while the rates were low...

33
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,386
你知道，获取有利条件
You know, take advantage.

34
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,324
有雄心，这是好事
Ambitious...that's a good thing.

35
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:17,702
我在海边买了块地
I got my hands on a beachfront property...

36
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,341
能容纳十套房子那么大
Big enough I could put up 10 units.

37
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,511
一开始经营得还不错
And it was all going great

38
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:22,113
结果我栽在了经营许可证上
until I got screwed on the permits,

39
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:24,085
银行不肯贷款给我
and then the banks wouldn't even look at me.

40
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:27,359
让我猜猜，有人给你提供了私人贷款
Let me guess... somebody offered you a private loan.

41
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:28,762
人家当时很绝望么
I was desperate,

42
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:31,034
我本来有三个月的时间偿还贷款
and I was supposed to have three months to pay them back.

43
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,940
这是老把戏了
That's the oldest trick in the book.

44
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:34,611
这帮人等你把钱花完之后
They wait for you to spend the money.

45
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:36,688
再把利率抬高
And then they call in the loan at high interest.

46
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,694
他们把我的帐全都转到
It turns out the money I borrowed

47
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:42,533
诺格拉斯·卡特尔那里
belongs to the Nogales Cartel.

48
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:55,669
是啊，孩子，你说的对
Yeah, well...you're right, kid.

49
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:58,340
你确实惹了大麻烦
You're in a lot of trouble.

50
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:00,442
他们闯入我家
They broke into my house.

51
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:03,848
我不知道该怎么办，只能跑出来了
I-I didn't know what to do.I just ran.

52
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,652
行了，你想让我帮你调查这个事是吧
All right,you let me look into it.

53
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:07,591
在这段时间里，你就住在我家吧
In the meantime, why don't you stay at my house?

54
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,860
你会比较安全
You'll be safer.

55
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:13,470
直说了吧，我不是来寻亲来的
All due respect, I'm not looking for a father.

56
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:16,046
我只是想寻求帮助
I'm just looking for help.

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,950
我明白
I understand.

58
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,823
卢克
Luke.

59
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:28,027
我明天再跟你联系
I'll check back with you tomorrow.

60
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:29,629
自己小心点
Well, be careful.

61
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:36,841
他真是你儿子吗？
He's really your kid, huh?

62
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:40,814
是的，他惹上诺格拉斯·卡特尔
Yeah. He's in the weeds with the Nogales Cartel.

63
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:42,151
我得保护他
I want him protected.

64
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:45,691
看着他，吉尔，别让他走出你的视线
Stay with him, Gio.Don't let him out of your sight.

65
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,397
提诺，诺格拉斯·卡特尔……
Tino, the Nogales Cartel...

66
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:51,770
你知道这会带来麻烦对吗？
You know this could be a problem, right?

67
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:56,180
他是我的儿子，斯塔沃斯，我能不管吗？
He's my blood, stavos.What can I do?

68
00:03:56,214 --> 00:03:58,885
跟特拉帕尼说一声，我要见他
Tell Trapani I want a meeting.

69
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:06,266
这些孕妇都怎么回事啊？
What's with all the pregnant people?

70
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,903
有个人在楼上的心里助产室晕倒了
Guy collapsed in a Lamaze class upstairs.

71
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:13,275
我们是创伤科的，我是沃尔克克斯大夫
We're from the trauma team.I'm Dr. Wilcox.

72
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:14,946
这是德芙琳大夫
This is Dr. Devlin.

73
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,115
我，我是贝瑟尼
I-I'm Bethany.

74
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,252
这是我丈夫斯图尔特
This... this is Stuart,my husband.

75
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:21,389
我们正在学习婴儿心肺复苏术，他突然就晕过去了
We were just learning baby CPR,and he just passed out.

76
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:26,398
血压83,40，可能是血管迷走神经性晕厥
Pressure's 83/40.Probably vasovagal.

77
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,935
输液一公升。他有什么慢性病吗？
Hang a liter.Any chronic illnesses?

78
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,437
没有。一般都吃什么药？
- No.- Medications?

79
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:31,606
没有，什么都不吃
No, nothing.

80
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,144
我们遵循自然生育
We're... we're having a natural pregnancy.

81
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:36,116
嗯，我们俩都是
Um, yeah, well, both of us.

82
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:40,621
波形宽而多变，像是室性心动过速
Looks like a wide-complex tachycardia, maybe v-tach.

83
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,854
这可能就是晕倒的原因
Well, that would explain the fainting.

84
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,154
注射胺碘酮
Start an amio drip.

85
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:45,856
心脏收缩降到68了，我们的赶紧注射胺碘酮
Systolic's down to 68.We need that amio fast!

86
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:47,091
不，别用那个了，他太不稳定了
No, forget it.He's too unstable.

87
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:48,393
我觉得得给他用心电复律器
I think we should cardiovert him.

88
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:51,095
打依托咪酯
Push the etomidate.

89
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:54,433
好吧，听着，贝瑟尼
All right, listen, Bethany.

90
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:57,104
我们得给他进行电击治疗
We're just gonna give him a small electrical shock

91
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,438
让他的心率恢复正常
to reset his heart to a normal rhythm, okay?

92
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:00,340
让护士带你到外边等着好吗？
Would you go with the nurse,wait outside?

93
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,011
我们会尽快告诉你结果的
We'll come talk to you as soon as we can.

94
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:03,113
不，我……
No. I...

95
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:09,117
准备，走你
- Paddles.- Clear.

96
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:23,637
安培表无显示
Amp of epi.

97
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:26,540
加油
Come on.

98
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:34,348
别死啊
Come on.

99
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,552
提诺，你把我约到这儿来
Tino, you brought me all the way out here.

100
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:45,221
也没给我带点吃的
You don't even bring those pignoli biscotti.

101
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:46,556
是啊，要是再吃那些垃圾食品
Yeah, you keep eating crap like that,

102
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,892
就等着等着让人把你
it's gonna take a dozen pallbearers

103
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:49,326
抬进坟墓吧
to put you in the ground, huh?

104
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,294
生意怎么样
How's business?

105
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:53,664
没法说，你叫我来干吗？
Can't complain. So?

106
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:56,368
听说你跟诺格拉斯·卡特尔有合作关系
Word is, you're in bed with the Nogales Cartel.

107
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:58,901
我给了他们一个废车处理的生意
I gave them a deal to traffic junk on the Eisenhower,

108
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:00,502
你说的是这个吗？
if that's what you mean.Why?

109
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:03,740
我有个很亲密的人跟他们有麻烦了
I got a guy close to me.He's underwater with them.

110
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:05,077
我想让你给他们打个电话
I'd like you to make a phone call,

111
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:06,912
帮我把他约出来单独见个面
arrange a sit-down for me.

112
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:07,912
你帮这个人是谁？
Who's the guy?

113
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,279
我儿子
My son.

114
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:12,251
啊，是你跟黑泽·克拉斯特（伊利诺伊州城市）那个女的生的孩子吧
Ah, the kid you had with that broad from Hazel Crest.

115
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:14,755
对，听着，我很感激你能帮我这个忙
Yeah. Look, I appreciate you doing me this favor.

116
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,787
没问题，我会尽力帮你的
No problem. I'll...I'll do the best I can.

117
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:19,522
你告诉他们我会负责他们全部的损失
You tell them I'll cover everything.

118
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:22,228
哦
Ah.

119
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:25,497
啊
Ah.

120
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:26,800
怎么了？
Is something wrong?

121
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,136
啊，我的妞
Ah, it's my girl.

122
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,804
她得了一种奇怪的感冒，好几个礼拜都没好
She's got some weird flu kicking her ass the past few weeks.

123
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,339
病得都下不来床
She can barely get out of bed.

124
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:35,941
哦，你知道我手下有个能出诊的大夫
Yeah, well, you know I got a doctor who makes house calls.

125
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,476
你想让我叫她帮着看看吗？
You want me to bring her over?

126
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,555
真的？
Really?

127
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:42,416
我的意思是，咱们互相帮助，朋友不就是这样嘛
I mean, that's how it works, huh? You help me. I help you.

128
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:51,125
我不该那么着急给他做心率复苏
I shouldn't have rushed into the cardioversion.

129
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:54,494
我们应该等胺碘酮或者试试腺苷（都是药）
We should have waited for amio or... or tried adenosine.

130
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:57,465
如果他的体征不稳定
And that could have sent him straight into v-fib

131
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,635
就是直接导致他的心律失常
if he wasn't going there already.

132
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,803
格蕾丝，处理心动过速的首要原则是
First rule of wide-complex tachycardia, Grace...

133
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,437
不能有创伤
Do no harm.

134
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:06,672
我错了
This is my fault.

135
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:08,676
你怎么跟他妻子解释？
What are we gonna say to his wife?

136
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,778
我们做了个病理判断
We made a judgment call,

137
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:11,578
我们俩都认为那是正确的处理方法
and we both thought it was the right one.

138
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:25,430
斯图尔特怎么样了？
How's Stuart?

139
00:07:25,464 --> 00:07:27,333
咱们坐下说吧
Will you sit down?

140
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:39,943
马斯蓝夫人，非常抱歉
Mrs. Maslan,I am so sorry.

141
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:41,677
你丈夫死了
Your husband died.

142
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:44,914
噢，我的天啊
Oh, my God.

143
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:56,822
我想看看他
I want to see him.

144
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,312
他尸骨未寒
He's still warm.

145
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:31,988
我们给他做了心脏起搏，但是他没挺过来
We tried to restart his heart,but he didn't respond.

146
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:35,321
你们为什么不给他抢救？
Why couldn't you help him?

147
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,860
我们已经尽力了
We tried everything we could.

148
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:41,396
斯图尔特的心率严重失常
Stuart had a severely unstable heart rhythm.

149
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:44,936
一旦发作，谁也没办法挽救
Sometimes when that happens,you just can't restore it.

150
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:50,775
要不要我给你的家人打电话？
Is there anyone that we can call?

151
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:58,679
我在哪？
Where am I?

152
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:04,354
黑帮天使 第一季 第十二集 复活
The Mob Doctor 01x12 Resurrection

153
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:06,526
==中文翻译：@godort==

154
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:19,380
我听说你们今天早上很兴奋
I hear you folks had quite an exciting morning.

155
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,670
上一分钟我还在心里助产室，一转眼我就死了
One minute we were at Lamaze,and then apparently I died.

156
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:25,252
抱歉
Excuse me.

157
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:26,432
没有心肌梗塞的征兆
No evidence of infarction.

158
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,634
醒来之后，他就一点事儿都没有了
Other than this cold,he's been perfectly healthy.

159
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,618
哦，太神奇了
Oh, he is. Or <i>was.</i>

160
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:34,039
到底怎么回事？
How did this happen?

161
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,377
有些医学论文上
There are several cases in the medical literature

162
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,062
把这种现象叫做“拉萨路综合征”
of what's called "Lazarus Syndrome."

163
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:42,590
病人在经过抢救无效宣布死亡之后
People pronounced dead who come back to life

164
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,684
又活过来了
after attempts at resuscitation have failed.

165
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,218
这种情况非常罕见
It's extremely rare.

166
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,689
我当了三十年医生了，从来没见过这种情况
In 30 years of practice,I've never seen a case,

167
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:53,161
所以我想跟我的两位大夫谈谈
which is why I'd like to borrow my two doctors for a moment,

168
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:54,463
如果你不介意的话。不，当然不介意
- if you don't mind.- No, of course.

169
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,868
说说吧，到底怎么回事？
So, what exactly happened in there?

170
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:02,069
我们也不知道
We have no idea.

171
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:05,008
你们是通过什么判定他死亡的？
What criteria did you use to call the code?

172
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:07,076
30分钟以上心脏没有跳动
Over 30 minutes in asystole,

173
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,445
瞳孔放大而且没反应
pupils fixed and dilated,

174
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,584
超声波显示心脏无跳动
and no cardiac activity on ultrasound.

175
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:12,719
嗯，好吧，那就说们确实死了
Mm, well, that does sound pretty dead.

176
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:14,053
他的心率仍然很不稳定
His rhythm is still grossly unstable.

177
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:15,688
但是没有心脏缺血病状
But no evidence of ischemia.

178
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:18,057
我们还是想不明白为什么他的心脏停了那么长时间又开始跳了
We still can't figure out why his heart stopped or restarted.

179
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:20,928
好吧，去约一下冠状动脉血栓CT检查
All right, order a stat coronary C.T. and echo,

180
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:24,100
确保他别再死过去
and make sure our Lazarus doesn't return to the cave.

181
00:10:27,638 --> 00:10:29,607
好，我这就去
Answer it. I got this.

182
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:54,800
听着，格蕾丝，我们要去看的这个人
Listen, Grace,the guy we're gonna go see...

183
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:57,136
是我的一个老朋友
He's been a friend of mine a long time.

184
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,607
他可能会跟你提到什么事
And he might mention something to you

185
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,843
我宁愿先告诉你
that I'd rather you hear from me.

186
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:03,343
我有一个儿子
I have a son.

187
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:06,478
他叫卢克
His name is Luke.

188
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:11,848
今天是我25年来第一次见到他
And I saw him today for the first time in 25 years.

189
00:11:11,883 --> 00:11:14,684
你们的关系不是那么亲密啊
Not exactly close, huh?

190
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:16,052
我爱我的儿子
I love my son,

191
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:19,825
我曾经尝试着关心他和他母亲
and I tried to do right by him and his mom.

192
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:22,930
然而我想他的母亲已经厌倦了这种生活
And I guess she just got tired of the life

193
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:24,700
他们搬到佛罗里达去了
and took off for Florida.

194
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:27,470
她让我发誓远离我们的儿子
She made me promise to stay away from him.

195
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:30,373
这对我来说太痛苦了
And I can't tell you how hard that was...

196
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:32,642
你知道，每个生日，每个节日
you know, birthdays, holidays,

197
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:34,376
连个电话都没有
not to pick up the phone.

198
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,979
但是我守住了我的诺言
But I kept my word.

199
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:38,479
你想弥补你们的父子关系？
You gonna try and reconnect?

200
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,644
不，太晚了
No, it's too late.

201
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:43,344
他只想让我把他从火坑里拉出来
He just wants me to dig him out of a jam.

202
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:45,847
除非你死了，否则没有什么晚不晚的
It's never too late till you're dead.

203
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:49,317
你又成乐天派了
Look who's the optimist.

204
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:55,527
如果这对你来说很重要，那么对他也一样
Just means if it matters to you, it might matter to him.

205
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:07,701
欢迎之至，提诺
Welcome, Tino.

206
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:10,872
这是特拉帕尼先生，这是德芙琳大夫
Mr. Trapani,this is Dr. Devlin.

207
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:12,708
嘿，叫我艾尔就行了，你能来真是太好了
Hi. I'm Al.Thanks for coming.

208
00:12:12,743 --> 00:12:13,843
谁病了？
Where's your patient?

209
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:15,813
让大夫去克洛伊的房间
Take the doc up to Chloe's room.

210
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:17,381
我一会就来
I'll be right there.

211
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,322
我给卡特尔捎信过去了
I floated the message to the cartel

212
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:23,257
我跟他说你愿意把卢克的欠款全部还清
that you're willing to pay off Luke's debt.

213
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,425
他说什么呀？
And?

214
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,361
这可是在跟大人物打交道啊
It's working its way up the food chain.

215
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:29,495
你好像有事瞒着我，艾尔
There's something you're not telling me, Al.

216
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,764
他们已经采取惩罚性措施了
They've already taken punitive measures.

217
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:33,563
他们要对卢克进行报复行动
They've ordered a hit on Luke.

218
00:12:33,597 --> 00:12:36,662
杀手已经到芝加哥了
The guy they hired is boots down in Chicago.

219
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:39,096
这人叫迪亚哥·布里特
It's Diego Balt.

220
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,431
他从未失手过，提诺
He never misses, Tino.

221
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:43,268
你的意思是说已经太晚了吗？
Are you saying it's too late?

222
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:45,708
我发誓我已经尽力帮你了
I'll do the best I can...I give you my word.

223
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:47,544
巴闭，给吉尔打电话
Bobby, call Gio.

224
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,211
告诉他找到卢克，我们随后就来
Tell him to find Luke,that we're on our way.

225
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:50,679
这就去
I'm on it.

226
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:53,548
我会把格蕾丝送回去的
I'll send a car for Grace.

227
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:56,489
哦，没发炎
Well, got no redness.

228
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:57,589
太好了
That's something.

229
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:01,458
甲状腺正常
Glands feel normal.

230
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:03,830
我浑身都疼
I just hurt all over.

231
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:08,100
你不发烧
Well, your temperature is fine.

232
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,770
哦，她得什么病了，大夫
So, um, what's wrong with her, doc...

233
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:12,472
是重感冒之类的吗？
Some kind of bad flu or something?

234
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:13,640
我还不敢肯定
I'm not really sure yet.

235
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:16,076
有什么慢性病或者做过什么手术吗？
Any chronic medical issues or surgeries?

236
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,158
我做过一两个整形手术
Well, I may have had a thing or two done

237
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:19,992
为了让我跳舞的时候更好看
to improve my looks back when I was dancing...

238
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:22,650
你知道的，很普通的那种
you know, normal stuff.

239
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:25,452
那么，都是什么样的手术？
So, what kind of surgeries are we talking about?

240
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:30,122
哦，鼻子，腹部，当然还有隆胸
Uh, nose, tummy,the girls, of course.

241
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:32,490
那么，你植入的是硅胶还是盐溶液？
And, um, your implants...Are they silicone or saline?

242
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:35,827
哦，我不知道
Uh... I don't know.

243
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:39,163
那是我的一个常客送我的圣诞礼物
They were a Christmas present to me from one of my regulars.

244
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:41,096
不能对礼物太挑剔对吗？
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, right?

245
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,097
问这干吗？
Why?

246
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:44,231
硅胶泄露
Silicone leaks...

247
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,968
会导致肌肉疼痛和免疫失调
They can cause fibromyalgia or immune disorders.

248
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:47,270
你能让我看看吗？
Do you mind if I check?

249
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:50,940
半个芝加哥的人都看过我的胸部，看吧
Half of Chicago's seen my boobs,so knock yourself out.

250
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,074
好吧
All right.

251
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:56,312
好
Okay.

252
00:13:57,882 --> 00:13:59,613
右边这个比左边的小
The right one's smaller than the left.

253
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:01,746
这样正常吗？不正常
- Has it always been that way? - No.

254
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:05,150
咱们得把它取出来再做一些化验
We're gonna need to remove them and run some tests.

255
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:08,184
越快越好。哦，我不确定
- The sooner the better.- Uh, I don't know.

256
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:10,621
嘿，嘿，嘿，听我说，不用担心
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.It's nothing to worry about.

257
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:13,426
你得先把你的病治好
We got to fix whatever's making you sick.

258
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,329
好吧
Okay.

259
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:17,230
我给医院打个电话定一间手术室
I'll call the hospital and book an O.R.

260
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:11,813
我马上就到，头儿
You almost here, boss?

261
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:13,981
他在富兰克林大街往北走了
He's heading north on Franklin.

262
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:16,150
他刚走过路口
He just passed superior.

263
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:17,850
不用，我能盯住他
No, I got him.

264
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,352
行吧
All right.

265
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:22,421
好，从芝加哥和富人区中间的小道传过去
All right, come up through the alley between Chicago

266
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:24,921
我能接到他，好吧？
and Superior...I'm gonna grab him, all right?

267
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:26,690
好吧，我看见他了。
All right. I got him.All right.

268
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:28,892
卢克，卢克！
Luke. Luke!

269
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,227
你在这干吗？
What are you doing here?

270
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,762
你爸爸叫我来找你。我不需要保姆
Your father sent me.I don't need a babysitter.

271
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:34,598
嘿，哥们，我只是执行命令，好吗？
Hey, buddy, I just do as I'm told, all right?

272
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:41,079
赶紧进来，你差点把我屎吓出来
Get in. You scared the crap out of me.

273
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:48,621
你被陷害了，孩子。你什么意思？
You been made, kid. What are you talking about?

274
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:50,355
你还带着你从迈阿密带过来的手机呢吧？
Did you bring your cellphone from Miami?

275
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:51,688
我当然带着了。让我看看
Of course I did.Let me see it.

276
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,930
嘿！你想被杀死吗？
Hey! You want to get killed?

277
00:15:57,964 --> 00:15:59,964
你刚才就差点让人杀了
Because that's almost what just happened. 

278
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,201
追你的这个人是个职业杀手
This guy who's after you is a serious player.

279
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:03,637
现在我得把你送到一个安全的地方
Now I got to get you someplace safe.

280
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,207
你是说这个事你搞不定吗？
Are you telling me you can't make this go away?

281
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:08,075
你要是恨我，我也没意见
You want to hate me, I'll learn to live with that.

282
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:09,543
但是你要想从这件事里全身而退
But if you're gonna get through this,

283
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:12,213
你就必须得照我说的做
you're gonna do exactly what I tell you.

284
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,137
艾尔哪去了
Where's Al.

285
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:18,623
他在走廊上呢
He's just down the hall.

286
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:20,960
嘿，克洛伊，我是鲁滨逊大夫
Hi, Chloe.I'm Dr. Robinson.

287
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:22,130
我来接管你
I'm gonna be scrubbing in.

288
00:16:22,165 --> 00:16:23,534
必须得做这个手术吗？
Are you sure we have to do this?

289
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:25,102
我的意思是，会不会什么地方搞错了？
I mean, what if something goes wrong?

290
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:26,537
如果你体内的硅胶泄露了
Well, if you have a silicone leak,

291
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:27,772
我们就必须把它取出来
we have to take care of it.

292
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:29,341
德芙琳大夫说得对，不过别担心
Dr. Devlin's right.But don't worry...

293
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,109
不会有事的
We're not gonna let anything happen to you.

294
00:16:31,144 --> 00:16:33,112
好吧
Okay.

295
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:34,747
开始吧
Let's do it.

296
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:36,582
静脉注射管插进去了
I.V. Line is in.

297
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:39,585
咱们确保我做完手术之后
Just make sure that the new girls

298
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:41,356
还能让艾尔喜欢我，好吗？
are up to Al's standards, okay?

299
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,327
绝对没问题
Absolutely.

300
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:53,342
那么，你看这个健康的心脏模型中
So, you can see in this model of a healthy heart

301
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:55,310
电流通过的
how the electrical current flows

302
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:58,845
的正确途径
in a regular pattern down well-defined pathways.

303
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,849
模型显示，斯图尔特的心脏
In this model, Stuart's heart,

304
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:05,484
电流脉冲
the contractions and electrical impulses

305
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:08,018
是杂乱无序的
are erratic and disorganized.

306
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:09,783
他两周没睡觉了
He hasn't slept in two weeks.

307
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:10,782
我以为是太兴奋了呢
I thought it was the excitement.

308
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:13,350
失眠？老做噩梦
- Insomnia? - Nightmares.

309
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:16,088
我老能梦见我抱着我儿子
I-I keep dreaming that I'm holding our son

310
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:17,789
然后把他扔到喷泉的池子里去
and I drop him down a well.

311
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:19,523
我们家根本就没有喷泉
We...We don't have a well.

312
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,192
我甚至都没见过喷泉，这真可耻
I've never even seen a well.It's... it's pitiful.

313
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:24,029
哦，不，这没什么
Oh, no, not at all.

314
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:28,367
第一次当爸爸都会很恐慌的
Becoming a father for the first time can be pretty terrifying.

315
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:32,304
那么，没准这就是问题所在，他反复说孩子的事
So, maybe that's what it is... He's stressed out over the baby.

316
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:34,270
我不同意，马斯蓝夫人
I don't think so,Mrs. Maslan.

317
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:37,239
可能是斯图尔特的生物电途径枯竭了
It's as if Stuart's electrical pathways are dying,

318
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,908
而我们暂时还查不出来原因
and our tests haven't been able to pinpoint why.

319
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:41,978
也就是说他还会再死一次？
So he could die again?

320
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:44,946
在我们找到病因之前
Until we understand the etiology,

321
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,913
这都不好说的
that's hard to predict.

322
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,047
好吧，那就是说
All right, so it looks like

323
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:49,714
我们还得在这呆一阵了
we're gonna be here for a little while.

324
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:59,519
预约EP检查，给他换抗肾上腺素药
Order an E.P. study and switch him to sotalol.

325
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:01,187
好的
Yes, sir.

326
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:04,090
你不是喜欢挑战么，威尔科克斯大夫
You like a challenge,Dr. wilcox.

327
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,525
挑战来了
Looks like you've got one.

328
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,303
这怎么可能呐？
How is this possible?

329
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,571
我还以为克洛伊的症状是来自硅胶泄露呢
I thought Chloe's symptoms were from a silicone leak.

330
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,073
但，那绝对是盐溶液
Well, those are definitely saline.

331
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,174
是啊
Yeah.

332
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,503
听着，好消息是
Look, good news...

333
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:35,837
她需要重新把假胸放回去
She needed the implants replaced,

334
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:39,173
而且我觉得我们干得不错
and I think we did an excellent job.

335
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,006
听着，她可能感染了某种病毒
Look, she probably just has a virus or something.

336
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,540
他不发烧
She didn't have a fever.

337
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:45,541
她也没有什么好转
Her symptoms aren't improving.

338
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:47,244
咱们肯定漏掉了什么
We're missing something.

339
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:49,014
大夫，她流血了
Doctors, she's bleeding.

340
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:52,151
是伤口吗？
From the incision site?

341
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:55,754
她的尿路大出血
Her urinary tract is hemorrhaging.

342
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:57,422
好吧，把她推到重症监护室去
Okay, get her to the ICU for monitoring.

343
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:59,223
给她做一个尿路造影照片
Type and cross for four and get a stat urogram.

344
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:02,093
赶快
Come on. Let's go.

345
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:24,175
好吧
All right.

346
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:26,374
这有足够你吃上几天的食物
You got enough food for a few days.

347
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:29,640
从现在开始，在我告诉你没事了之前，不要离开这间房间
Now, don't leave the room until you get the okay from me.

348
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:30,974
这太可怕了
This is crazy.

349
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:32,608
要不然我报警吧
Maybe I should have just called the cops.

350
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:34,043
不行，那是你最不应该做的事
No, that's the last thing you should have done.

351
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:35,078
你就在这安顿好就行了
Just settle down.

352
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:36,915
帕拉特尼正在跟他们接洽
Trapani's working his connections.

353
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:39,316
在这期间，我会让斯塔沃斯
In the meantime, I got Stavos reaching out

354
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:41,720
到迈阿密去找卡提尔的律师
to one of the cartel's top lawyers in Miami.

355
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:43,122
放心吧，都会搞定的，孩子
Everything's gonna be fine, kid.

356
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,088
你怎么那么淡定呢？他们已经找到过我了！
How can you say that? They already found me once!

357
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:48,424
除非你自己干出什么蠢事，否则不会有人找到你的
Nobody's gonna find you unless you do something stupid,

358
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,826
而且你也不会干蠢事的对吧
and you're not gonna do that.

359
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,827
哥们，别紧张，我们有人在这儿监视
Buddy, relax.We'll watch a little something.

360
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:53,795
不会有事的
We'll eat a little something.It'll be good.

361
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:55,663
你要不要我在门外安排点保安？
You want me to put a couple guys outside?

362
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:57,932
不用了，越低调行事约不显眼。
No. The lower the profile,the better.

363
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,804
艾尔，你的妞怎么样了？
Al, how's your broad?

364
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:07,837
她没事
She's okay.

365
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,771
她得了什么并发症
She had some kind of complication.

366
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:11,305
他们正在给她做检查
They're doing a scan now.

367
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:12,306
那些医生都很专业的
Well, she's in good hands.

368
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,341
谢谢
Thanks.

369
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:17,747
哦，咱们的对手有消息了
So, uh, I heard back from our compadres.

370
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:19,049
什么消息？
So, what's the deal?

371
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,681
我们能不能把那些债权都买下来？
Can we buy out of this with a bag of cash?

372
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:23,684
钱在这事上不管用了，提诺
Money ain't gonna do it, Tino.

373
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:27,055
兄弟，我之前说过，他们派到芝加哥的那个人
Guy I mentioned before... The one they sent to Chicago...

374
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:29,357
他被雇佣的当天就消失了
Well, soon as he gets hired, he goes dark.

375
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:31,927
想取消这个任务不太可能了
There's no way of canceling the job.

376
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:33,129
很抱歉，提诺
I'm sorry, Tino.

377
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:34,966
我知道你想保护你的儿子
I know you want to protect your kid,

378
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:38,969
但是这帮人可真不是好惹的
but these guys...they don't play nice.

379
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:42,968
好吧，谢谢你，艾尔，我知道了
All right, thanks, Al.Message received.

380
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:44,937
他帮不上忙对吧？
He couldn't do anything, could he?

381
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:47,606
听着，这还不算完，孩子
Look, it's not over, kid.

382
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,443
我得赶紧离开这儿。坐下，别紧张
I got to get out of here.Sit down and relax.

383
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:52,012
你说你解决不了这个事
You said you could fix this.

384
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,114
我会解决的
And I will.

385
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:54,450
你就会吓唬人
You're a bully

386
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:56,219
以吓唬人为生
who scares people for a living.

387
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:57,855
听着，我把事情搞砸了，我觉得你能帮我
Look, I screwed up,and I thought you could help me,

388
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:58,991
但是这事太可怕了
but this is insane.

389
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,094
你没好好想想
You're not thinking straight.

390
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:03,228
我想了，现在他们都知道我是你儿子，他们肯定能找到我
Yeah, I am. Now they know I'm your son, they can find me.

391
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,865
我在亚伯塔（加拿大北部城市）有个朋友，我可以去找他
I got a buddy in Alberta I can stay with.

392
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:06,969
我走了
I'm out of here.

393
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:08,473
你怎么就知道你在加拿大就安全了呢？
What do you think...You're gonna be safe in Canada?

394
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:10,008
甭管你去哪他们都能找到你
They're gonna find you anywhere you go!

395
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:11,910
那又怎样，我就一直被软禁在这
So, what... I'm just supposed to stick around here

396
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:13,212
看着你跟我这儿演爸爸？
and let you play dad until then?

397
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:16,049
我不干
I don't think so.

398
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,020
你胸前戴的这个勋章
This medal that you're wearing on your chest...

399
00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:21,523
告诉我这是怎了来的
Tell me about it.

400
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:22,758
这是我妈给我的
It was my mother's.

401
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:24,893
这是我曾祖父给她的
She got it from her grandfather.

402
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:27,060
不是，卢克，她没跟你说实话
No, Luke, she didn't.

403
00:21:27,094 --> 00:21:30,162
这是我爷爷留给我的勋章
That medal belonged to my grandfather,

404
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:31,697
是我把它送给你妈妈的
and I gave it to your mother,

405
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:33,699
她不会无缘无故把这个勋章传给你
and she wouldn't have passed it on to you

406
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,835
除非她觉得
unless she thought there was something right

407
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:37,538
送给她勋章的这个人值得依靠
about the man who gave it to her.

408
00:21:37,573 --> 00:21:41,607
不对，你胡说，她知道你是什么样的人
No. That's a lie. She knew what you were.

409
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:44,110
听着，事情没你想得那么简单
Look, it's not that easy.

410
00:21:44,144 --> 00:21:45,779
我的意思是，
I mean, who I am...

411
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:48,116
到了我该对这个家承担责任的时候了
it may have been a liability back then.

412
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,851
现在，我要保护你
But now who I am is gonna save your life.

413
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:04,225
嘿，马斯蓝夫人怎么样了？
Hey.How's Mr. Maslan?

414
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,893
不太好
Not good.

415
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:07,493
EP检查什么也没查出来
E.P. studies were a bust.

416
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:09,997
我就不明白了
I can't figure this out.

417
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:12,066
其他化验结果怎么样？不怎么样
- What about the other tests?- Inconclusive.

418
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,236
他的回波搏动没有不正常反应
No structural abnormalities on his echo...

419
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,905
冠状动脉CT正常。电解检查呢？
- Normal coronary C.T.- Electrolytes?

420
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,574
钙，钾，镁，磷酸盐……
Calcium, potassium,magnesium, phos...

421
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:19,843
都正常
All normal.

422
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:22,212
要不试试换一种抗心律失常检查？
What about trying a different class of antiarrhythmic?

423
00:22:22,246 --> 00:22:23,647
都试过了
All maxed out.

424
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:25,876
你说我会不会是第一个让病人死两次的
Do you realize I'm gonna be the first resident

425
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:29,724
住院医呢？
to have a patient die on me twice?

426
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,533
出事了！
Something's wrong!

427
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,334
点滴增压，可能是循环紊乱
Pressure's dropping.Looks like electrical alternans.

428
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:38,635
超声波
Ultrasound.

429
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:52,051
操
Damn it.

430
00:22:52,086 --> 00:22:54,086
心肺复苏术肯定导致了心脏内膜出血
The CPR must have caused bleeding into the pericardium.

431
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:56,188
我需要18号针和一个大注射器
I need an 18-gauge needle and a large syringe.

432
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:57,556
我不明白
I don't understand.

433
00:22:57,591 --> 00:22:59,459
我需要把斯图尔特心脏周围的血液抽出来
We need to drain the fluid from around Stuart's heart.

434
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:01,560
你确定吗？你们干得每一件事都只会让他变得更糟
Are you sure? Everything you've done has just made him worse.

435
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:03,361
抱歉，这是为了治疗并发症
I'm sorry for the complications,

436
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:04,362
但是我们必须把血吸出来
but we have to remove the blood

437
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:06,896
不然他的心脏就会停止跳动
or his heart will stop beating.

438
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:14,275
加油啊
You got it.

439
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,842
加油，斯图尔特，不要死
Come on, Stuart.Stay alive.

440
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:23,549
吉尔，好久不见，最近忙什么呢？
Gio, long time no see.Where you been?

441
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,885
啊，你知道，艾迪
Ah, you know, Eddie...

442
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:27,921
努力工作，确保生意运转
working hard,trying to keep the lights on.

443
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:29,656
你父亲的膝盖怎样了？
How's your dad's knee?

444
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,125
哦，很好，谢谢关心
Oh, it's good. It's good, thanks.

445
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,793
你知道，他说他的腿抽起来疼得要命
You know, he says it, uh,throbs like hell,

446
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:36,627
不过他最近报了个水疗班，已经好多了
but he's doing these aquatic classes and that's helping.

447
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,795
哦
Oh.

448
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,297
他最近在跟一帮老太太鬼魂
He's hanging out with a bunch of old broads...

449
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:41,799
那才是最有效的治疗
That's really what's helping.

450
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,800
哦，不好意思，艾迪，接个电话
Oh. Well, I'm sorry, Eddie.One second.

451
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:46,969
有事您吩咐，康老
What's up, Constantine?

452
00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:48,139
没有
No.

453
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:50,474
不是，你儿子让我出来买点东西
No, your... your kid sent me to get some stuff

454
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:53,978
骑士旅馆没有电话
'cause they don't have any cable at the Esquire Motel.

455
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:56,147
杂志之类的
Like skin mags and stuff.

456
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:58,149
好的，我知道了
All right, I got it.

457
00:23:58,184 --> 00:24:00,153
我知道了，一小时之内回去
I got it.I'll be back in an hour.

458
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,924
什么事啊？
What's that about? Ohh.

459
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,258
知道么，我突然之间就变成了一个
You know, it's like,all of a sudden,

460
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:06,593
傻逼保姆了
I'm a freaking babysitter.

461
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,262
他已经完全醒了，别问了
He's all wound up.Don't ask.

462
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:10,366
我要一个这个，好吗
I'm gonna take this.Okay.

463
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,366
我再来份报纸
Yeah, I'll take...I'll take a <i>Trib,</i> too.

464
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,768
好的
All right.

465
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:16,607
给你钱，别找了
There you go, Eddie.Keep the change.

466
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:17,775
回见了
Good to see you.

467
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:20,175
谢谢
Thanks.

468
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,794
抱歉
I'm sorry.

469
00:24:35,828 --> 00:24:37,964
我有个拉撒路综合征病人
I had an emergency with a Lazarus Syndrome patient.

470
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:40,970
他怎么样？不怎么样
- Is he okay? - Barely.

471
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:43,639
奥利维亚正为此抓狂呢
Olivia's really beating herself up over it.

472
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:45,474
还有一个事
In other news...

473
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:49,311
看看这个，克洛伊的扫描结果出来了
Check this out.Chloe's scans came in.

474
00:24:49,345 --> 00:24:50,712
肾脏瘤？
It's a kidney tumor?

475
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:53,749
确实是个肿瘤，不过不在她的肾脏上
It's definitely a tumor,but it is <i>not</i> on her kidney.

476
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,820
在她的前列腺上
It's in her prostate.

477
00:24:56,855 --> 00:24:59,691
你这是什么意思？
What are you talking about?

478
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:02,025
她曾经是个……男人
She was born... a he.

479
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:06,899
前列腺
Seminal vesicles,

480
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:08,669
输精管双方向结扎
bilateral ligation of the vas deferens.

481
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:10,338
她是个变性人
She's a transgender female.

482
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:12,070
这就是为什么她会做了那么多整容手术
That explains the multiple cosmetic surgeries.

483
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:13,670
这就是为什么她不愿意看医生
And why she didn't want to see a doctor.

484
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:15,473
但就算她曾经是个男的，我还是不明白
But even if she was a man,I would have missed it.

485
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:17,242
我是说，她那么年轻，怎么会得前列腺肿瘤呢
I mean, she's way too young for prostate cancer.

486
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:18,809
因为这种手术之后
Well, not if she's taking estrogen

487
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:20,275
都得打大量的雌性激素
as part of her post-op protocol.

488
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,610
我定了间手术室
Well, I booked an O.R.

489
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:23,612
从她的出血速度来看
At the rate she's bleeding,

490
00:25:23,646 --> 00:25:25,514
这个肿瘤的生长速度很快
this tumor's got to come out of her fast.

491
00:25:25,548 --> 00:25:26,850
好吧，我去跟她谈谈
All right, I'll go talk to her.

492
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:28,384
好的
Okay.

493
00:25:33,122 --> 00:25:34,855
嘿
Hey.

494
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,958
隔着绷带我看不见，我的胸部看上去怎么样？
I can't tell under the bandages.How do they look?

495
00:25:37,992 --> 00:25:38,991
非常的好
They're gonna be great.

496
00:25:39,992 --> 00:25:41,225
艾尔在哪？
Is, uh, Al around?

497
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:43,059
他去买吃的了，要我给他打电话吗？
He went to get food.Do you want me to call him?

498
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:46,395
不，不，不用了
No. No, that's okay.

499
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,397
哦
Um...

500
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,902
克洛伊，
Chloe.Mm-hmm.

501
00:25:52,937 --> 00:25:55,572
你的化验结果出来了
Your C.T. came back,

502
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:58,404
结果上说你的前列腺上，
and it looks like you have cancer...

503
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:02,204
长了个肿瘤
In your prostate.

504
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:04,873
不会吧
That's not possible.

505
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:05,873
不幸的是，会的
Unfortunately, it is.

506
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:07,706
这就是你尿血的原因
It explains why you're peeing blood.

507
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,940
我是个女人
I'm a woman.

508
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:10,772
对，你是
Yeah, you are.

509
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:14,377
但是从医学的角度上来说，你曾经是个男人
But at one point, physically,you were a man.

510
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:18,310
你的检查结果显示出你的男性性征
Your C.T. showed remnants of your male reproductive tract,

511
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:20,144
包括你的前列腺
including your prostate...

512
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,981
长了个肿瘤
With a tumor.

513
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,646
我还以为我都把那部分切除了呢
I thought I got rid of that part of me.

514
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,947
它现在又来伤害我
And now here it is...Hurting me all over again.

515
00:26:27,982 --> 00:26:32,117
我想你不能永远保守这个秘密了吧？
I guess you can't keep a secret forever, huh?

516
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:35,253
是啊
I guess not.

517
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:38,825
我们会让你度过这个难关的，好吗？
Look, we're gonna get you through this, okay?

518
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:40,093
这很重要
It is serious.

519
00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:42,497
在手术和化疗之后，你就没事了
But with surgery and chemo,you're gonna do great.

520
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:43,898
不，你不明白
No,you don't understand.

521
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:46,433
我跟你说了这是个秘密
I told you it was a secret.

522
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:48,104
艾尔不知道这事
Al doesn't know.

523
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,008
亲爱的，你的癌症已经到了非常严重的程度
Sweetie,your cancer's pretty advanced.

524
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,444
我们得给你做手术
We got to get you into surgery.

525
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:54,945
怎么做？
How?

526
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:57,113
我意思是，如果艾尔知道了
I mean, if Al finds out...

527
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:58,748
咱俩就死定了
He'll kill us both.

528
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,466
嘿
Hey.

529
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
嘿
Hey.

530
00:27:19,003 --> 00:27:21,641
哦，手术很成功
So, the, uh, surgery went well.

531
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:22,977
你感觉怎么样？
How you feeling?

532
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:24,645
有点晕
A little out of it.

533
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,413
两个手术，一个接着一个的
Two surgeries,one on top of the other...

534
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:29,180
晕是正常的
What do you expect?

535
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,953
她怎么样？
How'd she do?

536
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:37,154
我们把她腹部的肿瘤完全去除了
Well, we were able to completely remove the abdominal tumor.

537
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:38,590
太好了，谢谢你
That's great news. Thank you.

538
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,893
你感觉怎么样？
How you doing, honey?

539
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:42,628
挺好的
Good.

540
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:46,166
但是，哦，我们发现了一个意外的并发症
But, uh, we ran into an unexpected complication.

541
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,069
手术的时候
When we got in there,

542
00:27:48,104 --> 00:27:51,773
我们发现肿瘤扩散到了克洛伊的子宫里
we saw that, uh, the tumor had invaded Chloe's uterus...

543
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:55,408
所以我们必须把子宫切除
So we had to remove it.

544
00:27:55,442 --> 00:27:58,408
那，你的意思是
So, you mean...

545
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,814
我们不能要孩子了？
I can't have kids?

546
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:02,950
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

547
00:28:02,984 --> 00:28:05,685
没事，亲爱的
It's okay, honey.

548
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:09,853
只要你能好起来就是最重要的
As long as you're healthy,that's all that matters.

549
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,358
我们要是哪天想要孩子了
We decide we want to have kids one day,

550
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:13,927
咱就领养一个，好吗？
we can just adopt, right?

551
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:17,164
德芙琳大夫，你怎么看？
What do you say,Dr. Devlin?

552
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:19,267
我看没问题
Definitely.

553
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:22,107
行了，你们俩单独待会吧
All right,I'll leave you two alone.

554
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:25,278
谢谢你为我做的这一切
Thank you...for everything.

555
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,052
你看他呀
Look at him.

556
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,325
他喘气儿都费劲了
He's barely breathing.

557
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,058
不幸的是，
Unfortunately, the procedure

558
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,727
这个治疗方法让他心率失常
seems to have complicated the arrhythmia.

559
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,163
这么说是你们把他治坏了
So you made him worse again.

560
00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:46,704
贝瑟尼，亲爱的，别这么说
Bethany, baby, stop.Stop.

561
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:48,805
我需要你
I need you.

562
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:54,142
孩子需要你
He needs you.

563
00:28:54,176 --> 00:28:56,275
我看见
I see...

564
00:28:57,745 --> 00:28:59,279
圣光
Lights...

565
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,815
就像人们说的那样（临死前看见一道光）
Like people talk about.

566
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:04,317
别介
No.

567
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:07,187
什么样的光？马斯蓝先生？
What kind of light,Mr. Maslan?

568
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:08,855
光环
Halos...

569
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,055
金色的光环
Golden halos.

570
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:12,557
把检眼镜拿来
Get the ophthalmoscope.

571
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:14,527
这是怎回事？
What is it?

572
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:18,032
黄色光环可能是中毒的征兆
Uh, yellow halos may be a sign of toxicity.

573
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:20,269
你是说他老做噩梦吗？
You said he'd been having nightmares?

574
00:29:20,303 --> 00:29:22,104
对，好几个礼拜了
Yeah, the past couple of weeks.

575
00:29:25,273 --> 00:29:27,073
眼底正常
Fundi are normal.

576
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:31,177
我知道你说你们要采取自然生育
I know you said you were having a natural pregnancy,

577
00:29:31,212 --> 00:29:34,179
但是斯图尔特感冒的时候有没有吃过什么草药之类的？
but did Stuart take anything herbal for his cold?

578
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:35,681
我只给他吃过止咳剂
Just a cough suppressant I got him.

579
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:37,684
我还带着呢
I think I have it.

580
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:41,522
毛地黄（又称“狐狸手套”一种强心剂草药）
Foxglove.

581
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:43,692
把地高辛解毒药拿来
Grab the digibind.

582
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:45,728
他吃了多少这种药？
How much has he been taking?

583
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:48,733
哦，我不知道，每次他咳嗽的时候就吃
Uh, I don't know...Whenever he coughs.

584
00:29:48,768 --> 00:29:50,233
毛地黄是一种药效很猛的草药
Foxglove is an herbal version

585
00:29:50,268 --> 00:29:53,904
学名叫“异羟洋地黄毒苷”
of a very potent Western medicine called "digoxin."

586
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:57,409
用量过大的话会导致严重的心律失常
An overdose can lead to a severe heart arrhythmia,

587
00:29:57,444 --> 00:30:00,946
以及噩梦和幻觉
nightmares, and visual changes.

588
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:15,861
我只想用自然的方法生育孩子
I just wanted us to be healthy for the baby.

589
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:21,634
心率恢复正常了
The arrhythmia is resolving.

590
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:23,571
太好了
Yes, it is.

591
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:27,611
干得好，威尔科克斯大夫
Well done, Dr. wilcox.

592
00:30:36,557 --> 00:30:38,656
我呼吸正常了
My breathing.

593
00:30:40,324 --> 00:30:42,291
不，不，亲爱的
No. No, babe.

594
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:43,425
我已经好多了
It's better.

595
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:45,928
不，我说的不是那个
No, it's not that.

596
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:48,000
我觉得我的羊水好像破了
I think my water just broke.

597
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:49,333
啊？
What?

598
00:30:49,368 --> 00:30:51,467
哦，护士！
Oh.Nurse!

599
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:56,638
通知产房，告诉他们我们需要一个床位
Uh, call up to L&D. Tell them we're gonna need a bed.

600
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,728
嘿，克洛伊，气色不错啊
Hey, Chloe.You're looking good.

601
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:17,030
细想想，我觉得还不是太糟糕，
I don't feel so bad...You know, considering.

602
00:31:17,064 --> 00:31:18,964
你先回病房吧
I'll meet you back in the room.

603
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:21,463
我想单独跟德芙琳大夫谈谈
I just want to thank Dr. Devlin one-on-one.

604
00:31:21,497 --> 00:31:22,798
很快的
Two minutes.

605
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:25,498
好吧
Okay.

606
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:35,145
克洛伊的癌症到底是怎么回事？
I need to know the truth about Chloe's cancer.

607
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:36,714
我不是说过了么
Well, like I said, she has...

608
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:38,049
别骗我，格蕾丝
Don't lie to me, Grace.

609
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,150
我了解她
I know about her.

610
00:31:40,184 --> 00:31:42,619
我们已经好了有一阵子了
I've known about her for a while,

611
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:44,152
而且我始终还是爱她的
and I still love her.

612
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:46,620
好吧，这件事与我无关，
Okay, well, then, in that case,it's none of my business,

613
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,489
但是你为什么不告诉她你已经知道了呢？
but why don't you just tell her you know?

614
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:51,357
你说的对，这事跟你没关系
You're right.It's none of your business.

615
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:55,159
等我想好了之后，我会用我自己的方式告诉她的
I'll tell her when I'm ready and under my own terms.

616
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:57,227
我说明白了吗？
Do I make myself clear?

617
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:59,396
嗯
Yeah.

618
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,099
明白了
Of course.

619
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:04,504
你要是敢把这事告诉老康或者别人
If you ever tell Constantine or anyone else...

620
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:06,540
嘿，你别吓唬我行吗？
Hey, don't threaten me, okay?

621
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:09,678
我要是守不住秘密早就死了
If I couldn't keep a secret,I'd already be dead.

622
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,459
哥们，我想去吃中国菜
Buddy, I'm gonna go get some Chinese food.

623
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:31,195
用不用我给带回来点？
Do you want anything?

624
00:32:31,229 --> 00:32:33,396
好吧
All right.

625
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,107
嘿，你回家啦？
Hey, you heading home?

626
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:19,945
是啊，哦，我还以为你都走了好长时间了呢
Yeah. Uh, I thought you left hours ago.

627
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,449
哦，我忙着弄马斯蓝的出院报告呢
Oh, I stuck around for the Maslan delivery.

628
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:25,453
是个男孩，七磅两盎司（六斤五两）
Baby boy...7 pounds, 2 ounces.

629
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:27,623
母子平安
Mother, child, and Lazarus

630
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:29,091
爸爸也没事了
are all doing very well.

631
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,325
真不错
That's great.

632
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,663
我告诉奥利维亚这个消息
And I prescribed a cocktail for Olivia,

633
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:34,163
她这回可以放心了
who is very much relieved.

634
00:34:35,488 --> 00:34:36,934
这一天过得真紧张
It's been quite a day.

635
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:37,902
可不是么
Yeah.

636
00:34:37,936 --> 00:34:40,303
你本来觉得挺顺的事吧
Just when you think you've seen it all,

637
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:42,070
它偏偏就拐着弯儿地折腾你
here comes the curve ball.

638
00:34:42,104 --> 00:34:45,241
是啊，生活就是充满惊喜的，对吧？
Well, life is full of surprises,isn't it?

639
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:48,078
可不
Well...

640
00:34:48,112 --> 00:34:49,646
回见了，格蕾丝
Good night, Grace.

641
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:56,686
我跟你说，老康对付这种事绝对是大师
I'm telling you, Constantine played it like a chess master...

642
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,019
让我把藏身的地方暴露给艾迪·拉索
Had me drop the location right in front of Eddie Russo.

643
00:35:00,757 --> 00:35:02,560
拉索，那个讨厌的家伙总是信口雌黄
Russo... that creep's always shooting his mouth off.

644
00:35:02,595 --> 00:35:03,829
没错，一个小时之内
Exactly.Within an hour,

645
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:05,497
我就从我手下那得到消息
I get word from my guy at Tijuana grill...

646
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:06,697
这家伙已经行动了
Balt's on the move.

647
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:10,201
除了艾迪·拉索之外，走漏风声的另有其人
Eddie Russo isn't the only one with a big mouth.

648
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:11,835
你觉得杀一个诺加莱斯·卡特尔的手下
What do you think...it's a joke

649
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,738
是闹着玩的吗？
to kill a member of the Nogales cartel?

650
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:15,210
昨天我留了消息
I left the message 24 hours ago.

651
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:16,613
你能告诉他亚历山大先生和我
Could you tell him Mr. Alexander and I

652
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,214
有要紧的事跟他谈吗？
need to speak with him urgently?

653
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:20,282
对，嗯，谢谢你
That's right. Mm-hmm. Thank you.

654
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:22,115
诺加莱斯的律师，
The, uh, Nogales lawyer,

655
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:24,448
随时会给我们打电话，这孙子
yeah, is calling us back any minute, the son of a bitch.

656
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:26,016
我刚跟特拉帕尼说了
I just spoke to Trapani.

657
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,284
卡特尔同意休战
The cartel agreed to a truce

658
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:29,619
不过我还得约他见面说这事
until I can have a sit-down with them.

659
00:35:29,653 --> 00:35:31,722
太好了，头儿。走着瞧吧
That's great, boss.We'll see.

660
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:36,357
我从车上把行李拿出来了，我走了
I got my stuff from the car.I'm gonna take off.

661
00:35:36,391 --> 00:35:38,525
听着，孩子，如果你跟我呆在一起
Listen, kid, I'd feel much better about things

662
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,627
我会感到很安心的
if you came and stayed at the house with me.

663
00:35:40,661 --> 00:35:43,564
我不想让你觉得我感激涕零的
I don't want to seem ungrateful.

664
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,869
跟你一块呆着让我觉得别扭
I'm just... not comfortable with that.

665
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:50,041
但还是感谢你帮我这一回
But thank you...for what you did.

666
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:55,816
你不会是要出城吧？
Look, you're not gonna leave town, are you?

667
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,551
不出，我找个旅馆住下
No, I'm gonna check into a hotel,

668
00:35:57,586 --> 00:35:59,054
再跟这儿待几天
stick around a couple days.

669
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:00,155
无论如何
Whatever you do,

670
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,156
住旅馆登记的时候别用真名
don't check into the hotel under your own name.

671
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,424
用现金结账
You pay in cash,

672
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:06,261
别让我之外的任何人进你的房间
and don't let anybody in the room till you hear from me.

673
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:07,828
好，我知道了
Yeah. I got it.

674
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:10,763
很高兴你能在这儿多待几天，卢克
I'm glad you're gonna stick around, Luke.

675
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:13,033
知道么，
You know, it gives us a chance

676
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:15,436
这也许是我们相互了解的好机会
to maybe get to know each other.

677
00:36:15,471 --> 00:36:18,441
是啊
Sure.

678
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,910
我想见见格蕾丝
Look, I want to meet Grace.

679
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,514
我妈临死之前跟我提过她
Yeah, my mom told me about her before she died.

680
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,349
我觉得是时候我们见见面了
I think it's time we met.

681
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:29,750
我明白
I understand.

682
00:36:29,785 --> 00:36:31,718
听着，这事我来安排
Listen to me...I'm gonna handle this,

683
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:33,254
但是你得跟我保证
but I want you to promise me

684
00:36:33,288 --> 00:36:35,022
你一定要低调行事
you're gonna keep your head down.

685
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:36,925
加着小心
Be very careful.

686
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,660
行，我知道了
Okay. I will.

687
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:51,311
巴闭，把车钥匙给我
Give me the keys to the car, Bobby.

688
00:36:51,345 --> 00:36:52,812
头儿，要不我开？
Boss, you want me to drive?

689
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:53,814
不行，这回我开吧
No, not this time.

690
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:55,518
我得自己处理这件事
It's something I got to do alone.

691
00:36:55,552 --> 00:36:56,954
提诺，你这是干吗去呀？
Tino, what are you doing?

692
00:36:56,988 --> 00:37:00,327
我去找德芙琳
I'm going to the Devlins'.

693
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,268
有件事我都拖了好久了，这回得把它办喽
It's something I should have taken care of a long time ago.

694
00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:45,214
是的，是的，布克曼先生，很高兴你能给我打电话
Yes. Yes, Mr. Buchman,good to hear from you.

695
00:37:45,248 --> 00:37:48,448
给你打电话是关于你的当事人诺加莱斯
I, uh, called regarding a business misunderstanding

696
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:50,585
在生意上的误会
with your clients from Nogales.

697
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:52,772
是，哦，我知道帕拉特尼已经跟你说过了
Yes, uh, I know Al Trapani has already reached out,

698
00:37:52,892 --> 00:37:55,229
但是我们想直接……
but we would like to go on record direc...

699
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:59,331
你肯定吗？
You're certain about that?

700
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:02,335
我回头再打给你吧，谢谢你
I need to call you back, sir.Thank you.

701
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:24,629
接电话啊
Answer, answer.

702
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,230
提诺，诺加莱斯的律师回复了
Tino, the Nogales lawyer called back.

703
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,798
咱们有麻烦了
We have a problem.

704
00:38:42,215 --> 00:38:46,516
特拉帕尼骗了咱们，卡特尔根本就没想休战
Trapani lied about the cartel.There is no truce.

705
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:50,189
特拉帕尼根本就没把你要偿还卢克的债务这个事跟他们说
Trapani never even passed on your offer to pay Luke's debt.

706
00:38:50,224 --> 00:38:52,523
如果他们知道你没实现打招呼
If they find out you killed their man

707
00:38:52,558 --> 00:38:56,861
就杀了他们的手下，这事很快就会升级
without trying to negotiate,this is going to get ugly fast.

708
00:38:56,896 --> 00:39:00,230
提诺，赶紧给我回电话
Tino, call me as soon as you can.

709
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:26,858
哦，嘿
Oh. Hey.

710
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:28,528
我还说呢，谁进来了
I thought I heard someone come in.

711
00:39:28,562 --> 00:39:30,530
你怎么样？还好
- How you doing?- Good.

712
00:39:30,564 --> 00:39:34,301
我已经吃过了，要不我去给你热点儿剩菜？
I already ate, but I can heat you up some leftovers.

713
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:36,570
那太好了，谢谢你
Yeah, that sounds nice.Thank you.

714
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:39,173
我想赶紧去洗个澡
I'm just gonna take a shower real quick.

715
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:40,742
好的，你没事吧？
Okay. You okay?

716
00:39:40,776 --> 00:39:42,745
没事啊，我挺好的
Yeah, I'm fine.

717
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,079
好吧，爱你啊
Okay. Love you.

718
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:46,748
我也爱你
I love you, too.

719
00:39:46,782 --> 00:39:48,749
瑞是在盯梢呢
Is Ray watching out there,

720
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:50,681
还是坐那吃蛋糕呢？
or is he just sitting there,picking through pastries?

721
00:39:50,716 --> 00:39:52,950
他一边盯梢一边吃蛋糕
He's watching.He's eating the pastries, too.

722
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:55,052
看这上写着，这姑娘采访的时候说
Look at this. This broad lies in the interview...

723
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:56,417
她的胸部不是隆的
Says those are real.

724
00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:58,084
你还买这种玩意看呐？
You paid money for this thing?

725
00:39:58,118 --> 00:40:00,852
你在网上都能免费看这些姑娘的裸体
You can go online and see these broads naked for nothing.

726
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:03,490
巴闭，这叫返璞归真
Bobby, there's something to be said about old-school.

727
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:06,961
嘿，你们俩谁知道老康的电话本放哪了？
Hey, did one of you two move Constantine's phone book?

728
00:40:06,995 --> 00:40:09,165
哦，在菜单旁边
Uh, yeah, it's with the orders.

729
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:12,233
我跟他说过这种东西不能乱放
Did I not tell him to keep it closed?

730
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:13,902
可不么
You did.

731
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:16,142
康斯坦丁在哪？
Where's Constantine?

732
00:41:16,177 --> 00:41:17,811
去你妈的
Go to hell.

733
00:41:17,846 --> 00:41:20,650
他在哪？
Where is he?

734
00:41:20,685 --> 00:41:22,051
我不知道
I don't know.

735
00:41:23,218 --> 00:41:24,818
啊！
Ohh!

736
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:26,154
他在哪？
Where is he?

737
00:41:30,397 --> 00:41:32,464
他-在-哪？
Where... is... he?

738
00:42:03,362 --> 00:42:05,829
康斯坦丁
Constantine.

739
00:42:05,863 --> 00:42:07,698
你这时候来干吗？
What's the occasion?

740
00:42:07,732 --> 00:42:11,133
我们得告诉格蕾丝，丹尼
We got to tell Grace, Dannie.

741
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:14,036
告诉她什么呀？
Tell Grace what?

742
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:16,039
我们必须在她自己知道之前
We've got to tell her everything

743
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:20,111
把真相全都告诉她
before she finds out on her own.

744
00:42:50,283 --> 00:42:52,084
妈？
Mom?

745
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:54,255
妈？
Mom?

746
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:56,858
妈
Mom.

747
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:01,298
救命啊！
Help!

748
00:43:01,332 --> 00:43:04,634
来人呐！
Somebody, help!

749
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:06,968
救命啊！
Help!!

750
00:43:09,806 --> 00:43:12,245
