有些人就是沒法接受"不行"這個回答
Some guys just can't take "No" For an answer.

36
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,490
莫瑞根命令要回那張照片!
The Morrigan wants that photo!

37
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,730
哦 這事我還真不能怪她 你看了沒?
Oh, I can't blame her. Have you seen it?

38
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,390
不太雅觀啊!
Awkward!

39
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,740
肯吉助攻!得分!
Kenzi for the assist! Yes!

40
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,130
你覺得那招如何? 我假裝摔倒
Did you like that part? Where I pretended to fall on my ass

41
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,210
但其實像顆隱形導彈一樣正中目標
when actually I was like a stealth missile lasering in on target.

42
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,010
幹得好 記得提醒我幫你報名"與異種共舞"
Smooth. Remind me to book you on "Dancing With The Fae".

43
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,210
有那種玩意兒?
Is that a thing?

44
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,180
少說話多做事 快幫我把這高丑黑拽走 好嗎?
Just help me drag tall, dark and hideous out of sight, okay?

你懂得 要成為溫迪·懷內我還欠火候
You know, far be it from me to be a Wendy Whiner...

46
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,860
毫無懸念
Totally.

47
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,220
但這是本周第三次混球異種來襲了
But this is the third Faebag attack this week.

48
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,660

Your point, Wendy?

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,030
昨天是一個長的像裡吉斯的雙頭怪
Yesterday it was the two-headed thingie that looked like Regis.

50
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,860
那之前是個賣熱狗的小販
Then before that it was that hotdog vendor

51
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,730
但其實是個噴火的...?
that turned out to be a fire- breathing...?

52
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,200
- 要我說應該是 青蛙? - 海蜇?
- I wanna say, frog? - Jellyfish?

53
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,340
管它是什麼 我們海扁了它一頓
Whatever it was, we kicked its gelatinous ass.

54
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,880
我從未想過我會這麼說 但我就是個人類 波
You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm only human, Bo.

55
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,810
無意冒犯 遇上這事你也不怎麼歡樂啊
And, no offense, but you ain't lookin' so chipper either.

56
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,780
無論莫瑞根派來什麼異種 我都應付得了
Hey, whatever the Morrigan dishes out, I can handle it.

57
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,420
昨天那記鐵拳打得你還頭暈否?
You still got that doozie from yesterday's slug fest?

58
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,080
昨天那是刀傷
Yesterday it was a cut.

59
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,950
今天是淤青 我在癒合中
Today it is a bruise. I'm healing.

60
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,720
- 慢慢地 要很慢地 - 你說什麼呢?
- Slowly. Very slowly. - What are you saying?

61
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,060
那個醫生...我意思是...
The doc... I mean...

62
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,230
像不像是用倉鼠滾輪
you know, isn't it like trying to charge an iPad

63
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,100
- 試著給Ipad充電? - 好吧 暫停一下
- with a hamster wheel? - Okay, time out.

64
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,130
你到底哪兒不待見勞倫?
What exactly do you have against Lauren?

65
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,260
啥?
Moi?

66
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,430
得了 肯吉 
Oh, come on, Kenzi, with

67
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,530
你那些個挖苦加翻白眼
the little digs and the rolling of the eyes...

68
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,740
- 我又不傻 - 呃...
- I'm not stupid. - Well...

69
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,040
這可是機會 趁我還撐得住
Here's your chance, while I'm still high

70
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,670
不想吸元療傷之時 發洩出來吧
off my wicked moves. Get it out of your system!

71
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,340
她愛指手畫腳 佔有慾強 控制欲強
She is bossy, territorial, and controlling.

72
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,080
她覺得你幼稚 不負責任 還粘人
She thinks you're immature, irresponsible and clingy.

73
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,280
你這麼說!?
She does!?

74
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,920
你自己都那麼說過自己
Oh, you've said those things about yourself.

75
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,280
是啊 但是自己說自己那叫可愛好嗎
Yeah, but when I say it, it is adorable.

76
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,790
好吧 關鍵是我愛勞倫
Okay, the point is I love Lauren.

77
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,890
她對我很重要 你也是
She's a huge part of my life. As are you.

78
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,430
所以這場"閨蜜"對戰"女友"的戲碼
So in the Battle of BFF versus Main Squeeze,

79
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,700
我們該叫停了 明白嗎?
I think it's time we called a truce. Got it?

80
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,370
現在 大家和波一條心 去喝酒吧 我請客
Now, all those on Team Bo... drinks are on me.

81
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,910
那才對...
That's right...

82
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,550
布魯斯...你真讓我失望
Oh, Bruce... you disappoint me.

83
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,710
- 我叫斯蒂夫 - 怎麼回事呢?
- I'm Steve... - How did this happen?

84
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,410
不是我的錯 她有個後援
It's not my fault, she had an army.

85
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,620
- 別侮辱我的智商!
- Don't insult my intelligence!

86
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,690
你撒謊功力比你哥哥埃裡克都差
You're a worse liar than your brother, Eric.

87
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,860
- 他叫戴夫 - 我才不管!
- Dave. - I don't care!

88
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,660
要不是我剛去做了美甲
If I hadn't just had my nails done,

89
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,760
我早就親手把你的心挖出來了
I'd rip your beating heart out myself.

90
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,330
您真是太善良了
You're too kind.

91
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,870
我覺得某人的氣焰
I think someone's getting

92
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,740
真是越來越囂張了
a little too big for her leather britches.

93
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,880
快了 我的乖乖...快了
Soon, my pet... soon.

94
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,990
如果我們的小淫妖覺得玩得起
If Li'l Bo Bleep thinks she can play in the big leagues...

95
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,760
那就讓遊戲開始吧
let the games begin.

96
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,200
當你不知道你是誰時 生活會很艱辛
Life is hard when you don't know who you are.

97
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,370
當你知道真相後 生活會更艱難
It's harder when you don't know what you are.

98
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,000
我的愛伴隨死神的降臨
My love carries a death sentence.

99
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,870
我迷失了多年 在藏匿中找尋
I was lost for years, searching while hiding.

100
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,810
那個不為人知的屬於我的世界
Only to find that I belonged to a world hidden from humans.

101
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,880
但我已經厭倦了躲藏
I won't hide anymore.

102
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,420
我要過自己想要的生活
I will live the life I choose.

103
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,160
心電圖 核磁共振 植物病毒檢查
Ekg, mri, emv...

104
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,090
讀到虐戀劇情的時候再叫我
Wake me up when you get to S&M.

105
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,760
看吧 事實上 伐克斯...
See, the truth of it, Vex, is that...

106
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,040
別 別忽悠我 醫生 有話直說吧
No, don't sugar coat it, Doc. Just give it to me straight.

107
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,370
好吧 生理學上看 你的胳膊已經痊癒了
Okay... there is nothing physically wrong with your arm,

108
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,940
而且神經系統 肌肉骨系統也沒什麼問題...
or your nervous system, or your musculoskeletal system...

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,650
那 為什麼 我不能
Then... why... can't I...

110
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,380
- 使用異種能力? - 你還真會定期爆點
- Get it up? - Oh, regular riot, you are.

111
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,700
既然沒有生理學上的理論
Since there's no physiological

112
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,250
來解釋你的催眠術為什麼無效
reason for your mesmeric impotence...

113
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,690
啊哈!我讓你撓癢癢了!
Aha! I made you do that!

114
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,460
- 沒 其實 剛剛只是有點癢 - 該死的!
- No, actually, that was just an itch. - Damn you!

115
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,590
我意思是你的"情況"
What I'm trying to say is that your "Condition"

116
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,460
可能實際是心理問題
may be psychological in nature.

117
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,030
你意思是我廢了?
What, you sayin' I'm whacked?

118
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,900
像個瘋子似的? 傻子缺八兩?
Like I'm a nutter? A few ounces short of a pound?

119
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,500
以你的年紀 這現象很常見
It's not at all uncommon in Fae your age.

120
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,240
你知道你在跟誰說話嗎?
Do you have any idea who you're talking to?

121
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,370
讓你感受一下伐克斯之怒!
You shall feel the wrath of Vex!

122
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,410
擦
Bah!

123
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,750
你怎麼還沒勒死自己?!
Why aren't you strangling yourself by now?!

124
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,360
沒什麼好尷尬的
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

125
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,650
其實我有本小冊子...
I actually have the pamphlet...

126
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,150
哦 省省你那套可悲的醫生對病人態度
Oh, save your pathetic bedside manner

127
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,760
留給你那不長久的新女友吧
for your new, presumably temporary, girlfriend!

128
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,960
- 什麼? - 哦 得了...要滿足
- Excuse me? - Oh, come on... it can't be easy

129
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,460
上發條的淫妖兔的慾望可不容易啊
keepin' up with the Energizer SuccuBunny.

130
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,860
雖然戴森可以
Though Dyson could.

131
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,030
好吧 我覺得我們完事了
Okay... you know what? I think we're done.

132
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,830
不給我換點藥嗎
Any chance of a prescription refill?

133
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,400
- 出去! - 真的嗎?
- Out! - Really?

134
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,340
無情的醫生
Bloody physicians.

135
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,710
想像一下 假設什麼也沒問題
I mean, imagine sayin' that there's nothing wrong with it.

136
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,710
你聽過這麼扯的
I mean, have you ever heard anything so...

137
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,880
喂! 酒保! 我在跟你說話!
Hello! Barkeep! I'm talking to you!

138
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,220
- 還在說? - 難以置信!
- Still? - Unbelievable!

139
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,420
我在這兒掏心挖肺 你卻
Here I am, pouring out my heart to you and...

140
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,660
好吧 戴森 我可不是來娛樂的
Ok Dyson, I'm not here for my health.

141
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,930
你到底看不看這些文件?
You wanna look at these case files or not?

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,270
肯定看 再等等
Uh, absolutely. Just gimme a sec...

143
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,770
啊...問候你們呀
Ah... greetings.

144
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,100
- 閉嘴 伐克斯 - 什麼?
- Don't even start, Vex. - I beg your pardon?

145
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,510
- 我不會再給你買酒了 - 嘿  我很受傷誒
- I'm not buying you another drink. - Hey, I'm deeply offended.

146
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,210
- 很好 現在滾吧 - 嘿 你管不著我
- Good, now go away. - Hey, you don't own me.

147
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,580
好吧 聽著...
Okay, look...

148
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,580
你那悲慘遭遇我們已經聽得耳朵起繭了
we've been listening to your same sad story for days.

149
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,080
黑暗異族不想要我 光明異族受不了我
The Dark doesn't want me. The Light can't stand me.

150
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,750
我的朋友們...哦等等...
My friends... Oh, wait...

151
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,150
他沒有朋友 是吧?
he doesn't have any, does he?

152
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,920
- 伐克斯弱爆了 - 這是在侮辱我!
- Sucks to be Vex. - This is an outrage!

153
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,490
九號球 橫袋
Nine ball... side pocket.

154
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,440
那個妞怎麼回事?
What is it with that chick?

155
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,840
她不待見你而已
She's just not feeling the love.

156
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,440
- 但為什麼? -因為她覺得你是個殺人犯?
- But why? - Because she thinks you're a murderer?

157
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,040
但更重要的是 你最近在忙什麼?
But more importantly, what have you been up to?

158
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,180
什麼? 哦...
What? Oh...

159
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,850
- 又是莫瑞根? - 哦 小菜一碟 
- The Morrigan again? - Oh, piece of cake.

160
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,050
別小看那個女人
Don't underestimate that woman.

161
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,550
迦樓羅被打敗之後 光明異族
After the Garuda meltdown, the Light

162
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,620
和黑暗異族決定握手言和
and the Dark have agreed to play nice.

163
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,290
不結盟表示無保護
Unaligned means unprotected.

164
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,920
但是你忘了...
Oh, but you are forgetting...

165
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,790
我有這個
I have this.

166
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,960
我自己的小小保險
My own little insurance policy.

167
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,300
我還是覺得你應該跟阿什談一下
I still think you should talk to The Ash.

168
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,300
你看起來得好好休息一整子
You look like you could use a break.

169
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,000
我猜肯吉也可以
And I'm guessing Kenzi could, too.

170
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,940
不好意思...
Pardonez moi...

171
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,040
- 他又怎麼了? - 我不知道
- What's his problem? - I have no idea.

172
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,640
你自找的 你懂得
You brought this on yourself, you know.

173
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,610
你就是這麼當阿什的? 嚴愛政策?
Is this how you roll now? Tough love?

174
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,580
是你把莫瑞根拷在床上 拍了她的不雅照
You handcuffed the Morrigan to her bed for a Kodak moment.

175
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,980
你確定這跟
You sure this has nothing

176
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,420
你的異種聯合國實驗沒關係?
to do with your Fae United Nations experiment?

177
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,350
光明異種和黑暗異種搭檔辦案? 搞毛?
A Light cop partnered with a Dark cop? Really?

178
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,720
正是這種憤世嫉俗
It's cynicism like that has kept our sides

179
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,530
阻礙了真正和平的建立
from building a genuine peace.

180
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,060
還有 你戴森跟誰搞在一起管你什麼事?
Also, why do you care who Dyson is paired with?

181
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,430
- 我沒有 - 我可不覺得
- I don't. - Didn't think so.

182
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,830
知道怎麼做可以幫你擺脫現狀嗎?
Know what might help your situation?

183
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,740
碰巧我準備好了對光明異族的宣言書
Just so happens I had a declaration to the Light all prepared...

184
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,870
我是不會因為恐懼而被迫選擇陣營的
I'm not gonna be pressured into choosing a side out of fear.

185
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,770
好吧 不能怪我想試試
Well, can't blame an Ash for tryin'.

186
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,240
聽著 別管我了 我自己能解決這堆麻煩
You know what? Forget it. I can handle the shitstorm,

187
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,650
只是肯吉自己在糾結而已
it's just that Kenzi is starting to feel the strain.

188
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,420
現在誰才在上演嚴愛戲碼?
Now who's dishing out tough love?

189
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,280
波 等一下...
Bo, hang on...

190
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,650
聽著 自從我們解決掉迦樓羅之後
Look, since we got all Garuda-fied,

191
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,320
我一直在整理保存的機密文檔
I've been doing some serious inventory of the archives.

192
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,660
結果?
And... ?

193
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,730
似乎有人偷走了我的正義之杖
Seems someone has grabbed my Staff of Righteousness.

194
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,860
是一根木製的權杖
The Staff is a piece of wood...

195
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,100
珍貴的儀式遺物...能力強大
a treasured ceremonial relic ... and very powerful.

196
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,000
據調查這權杖最近現在
Currently believed to be in the possession

197
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,900
在莫蒂默·法斯賓德的手上 卑鄙的典當商
of one Mortimer Fassbinder. Pawnbroker and sleazebag.

198
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,670
所以 如果我把權杖帶來給你...
So, if I bring you this Staff...

199
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,340
我也許會派一支特遣隊到你家附近
I could probably post a security detail near your place.

200
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,040
幫你留意莫瑞根的寵物
Keep an eye out for The Morrigan's pets.

201
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,880
- 我去哪裡找這個法斯賓德? - 別心急 看反面
- Where do I find this Fassbinder? - Hold up, Slick...

202
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,150
你必須瞭解一下這權杖的背景知識
There's something you should know about the Staff.

203
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,620
謝了 布魯斯!
Cheers, Bruce!

204
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,330
可愛的女士 今天是你的幸運日
Lovely lady, it is your lucky day.

205
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,960
你邁入門檻那刻我就可以殺了
I could have you killed just for crossing my threshold.

206
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,330
嘖嘖 冤冤相報何時了
Tut tut, bygones and all that...

207
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,000
請讓我深切表達我對黑暗異族和你的忠誠
A heartfelt expression of my loyalty to the Dark. And you.

208
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,670
被困的我依然勾人
I am beautiful in restraints.

209
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,080
刪除...
Delete...

210
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,880
- 還有什麼別的事嗎? - 哦 你不該高興才對嗎
- Was there something else? - Well, I thought you'd be pleased.

211
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,550
如果你真心想討好我
If you really wanted to please me you would have

212
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,490
你就該提著那小賤人的頭來見我
brought me that bitch's head on a platter.

213
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,060
但是... 但是我...
But... but, I...

214
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:10,060
但是最近你好像異種能力盡失?
But maybe your recent bout of impotence has spread to your spine?

215
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,600
算你走運 我同情心氾濫
Lucky for you, my pity outweighs my disgust.

216
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,900
我不會殺掉你的 至少不是今天
I won't have you killed. At least not today.

217
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,210
哦... 你太大度了
Oh... you're too kind.

218
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,280
我們都有自己的苦衷
We all have our cross to bear.

219
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,410
喝了它快滾吧
Now drink up and go.

220
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,050
下次我見到你...
The next time we meet...

221
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,320
你和波不是她死就是你亡 你自己選擇吧
...either Bo or you will be dead. The choice is yours.

222
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,350
- 嗨 - 哦 嗨
- Hey. - Oh, hey.

223
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,320
你在做什麼?
Whatcha doin'?

224
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,830
哦 只是做些醫生的實驗
Oh, you know, just some Doctor-y stuff.

225
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,930
你知道 我確實對你的工作很感興趣
You know, I am actually interested in your work.

226
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,660
你可以告訴我你在做什麼的
You can talk to me about whatever it is you do.

227
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,400
真的? 你想聽聽我最近著手的論文
Really? You want to hear about my latest monograph

228
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,290
關於與人類血液相比異種血液的
regarding the rhizome repellent gradient of Fae blood compared

229
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,000
排斥梯度
with human blood,

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,110
尤其是當其懸浮在等滲溶液中
especially when suspended in an isotonic solution?

231
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,680
- 或者我們可以去看部電影 - 好吧
- Or we could go to a movie. - Okay.

232
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,510
- 那是什麼? - 哦...
- What is that? - Oh...

233
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,620
- 正義之杖 - 什麼玩意?
- The Staff of Righteousness. - The who of what?

234
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,350
別問了 哦 也別碰
Don't ask. Oh, and don't touch.

235
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,690
那麼 我能摸什麼?
Well... what can I touch?

236
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,260
啊哈 真有趣
Haha, very funny.

237
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,170
你怎麼啦?
What's gotten into you?

238
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,740
怎麼說 本來還真沒啥目的
Well, you know, nothing just yet.

239
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,340
但是現在我想也許我們可以...
But I was kinda thinking maybe we could, um...

240
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,710
哦...
Oh...

241
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,750
哇 我以為我只是順路經過
wow... I think I just came by

242
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,780
看看我的手機是不是落在這裡
to see if I left my phone here.

243
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,920
嗯... 我不清楚 讓我們看看...
Hmm... I don't know. Let's look...

244
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,620
它不在這裡 天啊
Well, it's not in there. Gosh, you know,

245
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,160
也許你把它調到震動模式了
with any luck maybe you left it on "Vibrate".

246
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,630
我以為昨晚之後你會很疲倦
I thought you'd be too tired after last night.

247
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,260
疲倦? 我可是力爭金牌啊
Tired? I am going for the gold in the Succu-games.

248
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,270
好吧... 我不知道你怎麼了
Well... I don't know what's gotten into you,

249
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,970
但我不能阻礙
but far be it from me to

250
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,970
一個年輕運動員的奪金夢
stand in the way of a young athlete's dream.

251
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,110
- 呦 阿伐 - 隨你怎麼叫
- Yo, V-man. - Whatever.

252
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,880
聽上去好像某人情緒低落啊
Sounds like somebody woke up on the wrong side

253
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,520
換了個人似的 怎麼啦?
of the pull-out couch this morning. What's up?

254
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,220
- 是我的胳膊 - 又在討同情了?
- It's my arm. - Again with the pity parade?

255
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,460
聽著 你的翅膀折了 你不能飛了
Look, you got a busted wing, you can't fly.

256
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,030
你要像我們這些可悲的人類一樣活著了
You gotta walk around like the rest of us poor miserable humans.

257
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,230
歡迎來到肯吉的世界! 老兄!
Welcome to Kenzi-ville! Man!

258
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,570
現在你知道每天被一群超級英雄
Now you know what it's like to be surrounded

259
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,500
環繞左右的感覺了吧 別抱怨了 可憐蟲
by superheroes every day. Suck it up, Pathetico!

260
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,810
如果我是你 我會重新考慮在做社工
You know, if I were you, I'd re-consider a career in social work.

261
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,440
我們能不能
Can we just...

262
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,610
忽略你的異種身份哪怕十億分之一秒
...forget about your Fae-self for like a nanosecond,

263
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,650
來聊一聊真正重要的事情?
and talk about something that's really important?

264
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,880
我表示懷疑
Doubtful.

265
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,050
- 睫毛膏 - 我洗耳恭聽
- Mascara. - You have my attention.

266
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,720
老兄 你的睫毛美翻了!
Dude, your lashes are freakin' amazing!

267
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,490
是啊...刷睫毛的手法最重要 等等
Yeah... it's all in the brush technique. Wait...

268
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,820
我在達·芬奇那裡找到了些小竅門
I picked up a few tips from Da Vinci.

269
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,190
- 像達芬奇密碼一樣? - 對 現在那裡有個娘炮
- As in The Code? - Oh, yeah, now there was a queen for ya.

270
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,660
他就是戴維的跟屁蟲
He was all over David's ass like curry on chips.

271
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,400
- 你能幫我整理下結塊的睫毛嗎? - 哦別這樣
- Can you help me with my clumping? - Oh, please...

272
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,300
嗨 大傢伙
Hey, y'all.

273
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,830
嗨... 怎麼了?
Hey... Whazat?

274
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
長話短說 這就是個關於
The end of a long story, involving

275
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,610
諂媚的典當商和曖昧談判的故事
a greasy pawnbroker and some hardcore negotiating.

276
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,810
呃 別吵 我們在做正事呢
Uh, do you mind? We're working over here.

277
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
有人看見我的手機了嗎?
Anyone seen my phone?

278
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,580
你說手機? 怎麼 你的手機?
You say phone? What, your phone?

279
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,280
聽著 高抬貴臀讓我看看坐墊下面有沒有
Here, shift a cheek so I can look under the cushions...

280
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,850
沒有
Nothing...

281
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,590
- 往旁邊挪! - 你最後一次用它在哪裡?
- Scootch! - Where'd you last have it?

282
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,220
這就是問題關鍵... 我發誓我把它放在...
That's the thing... I coulda sworn that I left it...

283
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,190
Ipad Iphone什麼的電子產品 
Yeah, iPads, iPhones electricity...

284
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,390
說實話 只是一時狂熱而已
it's all just a fad, really.

285
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,060
類似產品數不勝數 真理哦
The future's analog and all that. I'm tellin' ya.

286
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,400
我這麼刷對嗎?
Am I doing it right?

287
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,640
呃...
Uh...

288
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,040
嗯... 再往上一點...
Hmm... just a little bit up...

289
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,140
我 的 天
O.M.G.

290
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,410
你們在一起太有愛了
You guys are so cute together.

291
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,710
- 哈! - 呵...
- Ha! - Huh...

292
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,050
但願我也能有個一起化妝的夥伴
I wish I had a makeup buddy.

293
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,250
我本以為她可以成為朋友 可她壓根就不喜歡我
I thought she could be my friend, and she doesn't even like me.

294
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,250
- 誰? - 塔米辛!
- Who? - Tamsin!

295
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,960
她老刻薄了 對吧?
She is so mean girl, right?

296
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,790
我的意思是 就一個擁有實際人格的異種來說
I mean, buy an actual personality already.

297
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,130
你該不會是碰巧搜了我的行李箱
Did you happen to rifle through my duffel bag,

298
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,100
然後吞掉了那些老虎圖案的黃色藥片?
and scarf down a couple of yellow pills with tigers on 'em?

299
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,670
我要跟戴森談談
I'm gonna talk to Dyson.

300
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,710
順便說一下 這可以是私人秘密
and BTW?, It is "tres" private.

301
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
私密?
Private?

302
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,880
勞倫要怒火中燒了!
Lauren's pelt is gonna be steamed!

303
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,650
你跟那個醫生又是什麼恩怨?
What's it with you and the Doc?

304
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,350
我指 除了她對病人的態度
I mean, besides her terrible bedside manner

305
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,020
和她腦瓜比你靈的事實
and the fact that she's a damn sight cleverer than you.

306
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,620
還很卑鄙 她在監視波
Not to mention sneaky. She spy-banged Bo.

307
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,830
可戴森傷了波這麼多次
Dyson's drop-kicked Bo's heart ten times over,

308
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,360
而且他在的時候你還對他大吼大叫的
and you still howl when he comes 'round.

309
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,300
我...! 沒有!
I...! No!

310
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
聽著 你到底還要不要教我
Listen, are you gonna teach me

311
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,240
雙面防水防污刷睫毛法了?
the double pump smudge-proof technique or not?

312
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,710
我為你感到驕傲 過來...
I'm so proud of you. Come here...

313
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,740
好了 你要像這樣刷睫毛根部
Alright, you're gonna move it like this just at the ends.

314
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,610
你不要... 手抖...
You can't... like shake it...

315
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,350
我不喜歡你朋友
I do not like your friend.

316
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,880
她不是我朋友 她只是我的新搭檔
She's not my friend. She is my new partner.

317
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,650
她怎麼說的我?
What is she saying about me?

318
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,860
不管她怎麼說 那都不是真的
Because whatever it is, it's not true.

319
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,890
- 你喝高了? - 什麼? 你指酒?
- Have you been drinking? - What? Like, alcohol?

320
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,860
我倒希望如此
I wish.

321
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,170
- 你有假身份證嗎? - 什麼?
- Do you have fake ID? - What?

322
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,470
我們做吧
Let's do it.

323
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,570
我們去吧
Let's get faced!

324
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,110
好吧 你有點不對勁 我要去跟特裡克談談
Okay, you are cut off. I'm gonna talk to Trick.

325
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,990
哇 你真美
Wow, you're so beautiful.

326
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,330
抱歉...
I'm sorry...

327
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,960
我得走了...
I gotta go...

328
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,710
- 我認為戴森喜歡我 - 什麼?
- I think Dyson likes me. - Say what?

329
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,280
別告訴別人... 但我有吻他的衝動!
Don't tell anyone this... but I think I might kiss him!

330
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,000
瞳孔沒有擴張...
There's no pupil dilation...

331
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,540
沒有腦震盪
no concussion...

332
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,200
我困惑了
I'm stumped.

333
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,940
你的眼眸就像星星一樣閃亮
You have little specks in your eyes that look like stars.

334
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,440
當我多慮了 但是你
Call me crazy, but based on

335
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,940
在酒吧的狀態
your little display at the bar...

336
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,250
我是說 我知道你和戴森有過去
I mean, I do know that you and Dyson...

337
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,150
三號通道洩露! 三號通道洩露!
Spill on aisle 3! Spill on aisle 3!

338
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,210
嗷 嗷
Ow, ow...

339
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,750
來嘛! 我們去看電影吧
Come on! Let's go to a movie.

340
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,220
哇 火辣的美妞 你吻過女孩不?
Wow, you're really hot. Have you ever kissed a girl?

341
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,260
我需要你乖乖坐好 還得檢查你的心電圖 好嗎?
I need you to sit still to check your EKG, ok?

342
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,960
- 呲 - 波 別鬧!
- Bzzz! - Bo, stop!

343
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,390
現在我們已經交換了腦電波
We have now swapped brains.

344
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,160
嗨 我是勞倫醫生 我特無趣
Hi, I'm Dr. Lauren. I don't like to have any fun.

345
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,630
帶兩個皺眉圖案的布朗尼蛋糕 明天打電話找我吧
Take two frownie brownies and call me in the morning.

346
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,100
你這樣兒真嚇到我了
You're really starting to scare me.

347
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,800
好了 波 聽我說
Okay Bo... just listen to me...

348
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,000
波! 聽我說
Bo! Listen to me...

349
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,210
你最近有接觸過陌生的異種嗎
have you come in contact with any strange Fae lately...?

350
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,610
- 這太無聊了 - 波 拜託!
- This is so lame! - Bo! Please!

351
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,040
好吧
Okay, well...

352
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,910
倒是遇到一個揮著魔棒的惡男
there was this one gross guy with a magic stick...

353
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,460
嗨 塔米兒 塔辛 砰砰辛警官 
Hey, Tammers. "T-sin". Officer "Slamsin"!

354
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,500
- 好吧 - 你這是在自娛自樂嗎?
- Okay... - Are you playin' with yourself?

355
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,200
這是誰拿啤酒把你給灌倒了?
Did somebody spike your brewski?

356
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,100
兄弟 這一刻終於發生了
Dude... this one time That totally happened.

357
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,800
我要扮肯吉 一個模子刻出來的有木有
I got to be Kenzi. Nailed it.

358
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,740
好吧 這要是是你想在我們辦案前就想讓我出局
Right... if you're trying to throw me off my game

359
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,570
這招還真管用了
before we get down, it's working.

360
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,710
- 你覺得波對我有好感嗎? - 我看著像管這種閒事的人麼
- Do you think Bo likes me? - Do I look like I care?

361
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,220
我想約她出去
I think I'm gonna ask her on a date.

362
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,420
好吧 你自便吧
Okay, well... knock yourself out.

363
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,620
於此同時 你要不就一起玩
In the meantime... you're either in the game...

364
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:27,830
- 要不就別擋道 - 你真是個壞傢伙
- or you are in my way... - You are so badass.

365
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,600
波和戴森排排坐樹上
Bo and Dyson sitting in a tree...!

366
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,070
噓!
Shhhhhh!

367
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,270
親親吻吻真親密
K-I-s-s-I-n-g!

368
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,780
哦 這場景太浪漫了! 但是 噓! 隔牆有耳
Oh, that would be so awesome! But, shhh! People are listening.

369
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,380
- 嗨 爺爺 這是啥? - 十七世紀
- Hey, Gramps, what's this? - Seventh century.

370
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,050
拜託 請把它放回我的書桌
Please, put it back in my study.

371
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,990
- 惡 她樣子好醜 - 把它放回去
- Ew, she's gross. - Just put it back.

372
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,720
把它放回去 能把車鑰匙給我嗎?
"Put it back." Can I have the car keys?

373
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,630
不行
No.

374
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,300
要是不給我車鑰匙 我就用法語數數
If I don't get the car keys, I'm gonna count to a hundred.

375
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,670
數到一百為止
In French .

376
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,400
- 老天 - 看到沒?
- Good grief... - See what I mean?

377
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:09,970
一
Un.

378
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,140
二!
Deux!

379
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,470
三
Trois...

380
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,890
你覺得她這症狀
You think this is being

381
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,410
像是因為阿什派她處理的任務而引起的嗎?
caused by the job that The Ash sent her on?

382
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,350
四
Quatre...

383
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,410
你說呢
You tell me.

384
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,520
四
Quatre...

385
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,220
會不會是正義之杖引起這樣的症狀?
Can the Staff of Righteousness have symptoms like these?

386
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,250
- 四! - 是五!
- Quatre...! - Cinq!

387
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,120
- 我的神 是五! - 抱歉 法國警官
- For the love of Aphrodite, it's cinq! - Sorry, French Police.

388
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,330
五
Cinq.

389
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,590
六
Six...

390
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
乍看之下 沒有記錄
At first glance, there's nothing in the lore

391
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,600
顯示這根權杖會引起這樣的症狀
that suggest the Staff is causing her symptoms.

392
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,930
但你也不能否認 這是很詭異的巧合
You have to admit, it's a pretty strange coincidence.

393
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,800
她找回權杖後 就成現在這個
She goes looking for the Staff and comes back like...

394
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,410
- 無憂無慮的傻妞 - 沒錯
- Pollyanna on mushrooms? - Exactly.

395
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,840
- 嗨 - 怎麼了?
- Hey... - What?

396
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,670
怎麼沒聽到數七?
Where's "Seven"?

397
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,150
波 快下來!
Bo, get down!

398
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,390
嘿! 讓我跳完! 別對我說教
Hey! Let me finish! Don't Kanye me.

399
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,090
- 你作弊! - 你能奈我何!
- You are a cheater! - Whatever!

400
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,690
你個騙子 詛咒你長痘痘
You're a cheater. And you're getting a zit.

401
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,170
波說的對 你個刻薄的女人!
Bo is right. You're mean!

402
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,070
不管是什麼引起的 這症狀會傳染
Whatever this is... it's contagious.

403
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,310
別用棕色了 黑色才能刷出新意
...you gotta forget about brown... black is always the new black.

404
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,180
- 你別老跟著我們 - 是啊 你又不是我們的老媽
- You can't ground us. - Yeah. You're not our Mom.

405
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,450
沒錯 我們才不要聽你的話
Yeah, we don't even have to listen to you.

406
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,220
所以 波把他倆都帶瘋了?
So... Bo shagged them both daft?

407
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,360
- 我們有麻煩了 - 更像是爛麻煩
- We have a situation. - More like a SHITuation.

408
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,820
你們像參觀參觀我的臥室嗎?
You guys wanna see my room?

409
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,890
- 額 當然 - 看誰跑得快!
- Uh... yeah! - Shotgun!

410
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,160
- 不! 不! - 別 等等! 等等!
- No! No! - No, wait! Wait!

411
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,800
有東西引起了這個症狀 更糟糕的是
Something's made them sick. And what's worse is the...

412
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,070
- 這是? - 一頭豬?
- Is that...? - A pig...?

413
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,840
他在尋找些什麼東西
He's looking for something...

414
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,850
或是什麼人! 波
Or someone! Bo...

415
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,850
肯吉 刀在哪兒? 你的工具箱也行?
Kenzi, where is there a knife? Or your trunk?

416
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,050
- 額 在樓上呢! - 好吧 那你的劍呢?
- Uh, upstairs! - Well, what about your sword??

417
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,450
- 在 樓上! - 好吧 肯吉 趕緊想辦法!
- Up... stairs! - Okay, well, Kenzi, think of something!

418
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,790
動腦筋神馬的不是一般都是你的事麼 醫生!
That's usually your thing, Doc!

419
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,120
這隻小肥豬就準備去市場掛售吧
This little piggy's about to go to market!

420
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,170
我們需要武器! 我們需要東西來防衛!
We need a weapon! We need something!

421
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,490
該死的
Bloody hell...

422
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,290
行了 豬豬 行了
That'll do, pig... that'll do.

423
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,490
你是怎麼
How did you...

424
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,490
我
I...

425
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,500
原來你才是匹黑馬
Aren't you the dark horse.

426
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,910
他死了
He's dead.

427
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,240
兄弟 我只是隨手抓了根棍子
Dudes, all I did was grab this stupid shillelagh

428
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,410
然後突然之間我就成了達斯·維達
and all of a sudden I'm Darth Vader.

429
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,950
- 讓我看看 - 說起這個
- Let me see that... - Yeah, about that...

430
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,820
這棍子貌似有點 粘在手上拿不下來了
the shaft is kinda... Fae-zy Glued to my hand.

431
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,460
是啊 我也有類似經歷
Yeah... That happened to me once.

432
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,360
苦不堪言
Painful.

433
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,670
"趕緊拿個武器"她如是說
"Grab a weapon," She said.

434
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,910
這看起來像是高能鍵
It seems to be an energy bond.

435
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,940
- 那就解開鍵連吶 - 做不到啊
- So un-bond it. - I can't.

436
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,610
這木頭和你手上的肉融為一體了
The wood is melded to your flesh.

437
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,550
世上最挫的手淫工具
Worst hand job ever.

438
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,780
哇 老兄! 拿刀作甚?
Whoa, Mack! The knife!?

439
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,450
不是啊 我電視上看到的 切木頭和番茄
No, I saw it on TV. It cuts right through wood.

440
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,890
輕而易舉
And tomatoes.

441
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,590
不是我的錯 棍子惹的禍
Not my bad. Stick bad.

442
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,600
還有 這音樂難聽死了!
Plus... your music sucks!

443
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,930
我買那碟是用來鄙視的
I bought that one ironically.

444
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,130
說實話 沒看得上眼的
All of them, actually...

445
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,670
- 額 這到底是啥? - 哦 看看這貨!
- Um, what the heck is this? - Oh! Look at that!

446
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,840
你聲音怎麼了?怎麼突然冒蘇格蘭口音
What is with your voice? It's all Scottish-y.

447
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,540
哦 好吧 你喜歡不?
Oh! Well, do you like it?

448
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,240
挫透了
It's lame.

449
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,910
- 不喜歡 喲 同志們! 我們遭攻擊了
- No. - Yo, peeps! We are under attack!

450
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,850
- 尖叫聲在哪裡 - 這下好了
- Big whoop. - Fascinating.

451
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,820
他們貌似連危機感都消失了
They seem to be immune to any sense of danger.

452
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,120
哦 真要命 嘿!
Oh for god sakes... Hey!

453
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,990
我們客廳還躺著只死豬呢
We have a dead man-pig in the living room,

454
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,090
我這還有根樹枝離不了手
I have a tree stuck to my mitt,

455
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,590
我可不想報名加入幼托俱樂部
and I did not sign up for the babysitter's club!

456
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,000
哦 戴森碰到我的胸了!
Oh, Dyson touched my boob!

457
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,200
這是個意外! 那是我胳膊肘干的!
That was an accident! It was with my elbow!

458
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,400
拜託!這不算!
Doesn't even count! Come on!

459
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,570
不是吧!
Seriously?

460
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,740
同志們 同志們 同志們! 我們點披薩吃吧!
Guys, guys, guys! Let's order pizza!

461
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,040
沒錯
Yes.

462
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,870
他們三個處於某種原因都被感染了
For some reason, only the 3 of them are infected.

463
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,440
我們要小心點
Let's not take any chances.

464
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,710
不要和他們有肢體接觸直到我找到真正病因
No physical contact until I know what we're dealing with.

465
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,540
- 明白了 - 雙層奶酪! 好耶!
- Got it. - Double cheese! Yeah!

466
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,210
雙層奶酪! 披薩!
Double cheese! PiZZA!

467
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,910
- 披薩! - 披薩!
- Pizza!!! - Pizza!

468
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,750
然後你們三個 乖乖呆著別亂跑
And you three, stay put.

469
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,080
快買披薩來!
Get the pizza!

470
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,820
這些武器你哪兒來的?
Where did you get these??

471
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,720
- 太屌了! - 給我一把
- It's fantastic! - Give it to me...

472
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,760
弱爆了
Totally lame...

473
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,360
哇 這還有一把! 你!放馬過來吧
Aww... There's another one! Come here, you!

474
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,060
我不明白的是
What I don't understand

475
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,130
要是異種才是感染對像
is that if this disease only targets Fae...

476
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,660
那為什麼伐克斯沒事呢?
Why isn't Vex infected?

477
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,030
怎麼說 也許是我超級逼真的妝容
Well, perhaps my superior genetic makeup

478
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,940
免疫了外界的侵害
has rendered me immune to embarrassing afflictions.

479
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,510
- 那是啥? - 什麼?
- What is that? - What?

480
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,880
你耳後有奇怪的膿包
You have a strange pustule behind your ear

481
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,980
我上次給你檢查的時候還沒有呢
that wasn't there when I examined you last.

482
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,980
膿包 惡
Pustule... Ew.

483
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,160
惡 噁心!
Ugh... Ugh! UGH!

484
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,860
噁心死人了
Ewww with a double side of hurl.

485
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,830
- 這是什麼? - 像是什麼留下的繭
- What is it?? - It's what's left of a cocoon.

486
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,530
看來你被用作孵卵器了
You've been used as an incubator.

487
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,560
- 被什麼當做孵卵器? - 我的猜測
- By what? - My guess?

488
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,630
- 寄生蟲 - 什麼? 我不乾淨?
- A parasite. - What? I'm unclean?!

489
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,570
放輕鬆 已經不在你體內了
Relax... it isn't in you anymore.

490
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,470
但是你哪兒招來的這寄身蟲呢?
But where could you have picked this up?

491
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,870
你最近有很陌生異種待一起麼?
Have you been with any strange Fae lately?

492
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,340
呃 他媽的賤人!
Ugh... damn bitch!

493
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,950
- 那是怎麼了? - 那是怎麼了?
- What's that? - What's that?

494
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,650
哦 沒事 額
Oh, nothing, uh...

495
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,820
這事搞得我好受傷 額
I was just saying how devastated I was about all this, uh...

496
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,950
聽著 我這就去找特裡克幫忙 好不?
Listen, I'm gonna get some help from Trick. Alright?

497
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,820
我會想辦法補救的 好不?
I'm gonna make things right. Alright?

498
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,320
你他媽對我做了什麼?
What the hell did you do to me!?

499
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,270
拿你當傳播寄生蟲的利器了
Used you to spread a parasite.

500
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,230
- 哪種變態寄生蟲 - 吸元寄生的那種
- What kind of bloody parasite!? - The parasitic kind.

501
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,570
靠吸取被害者對他人好感的荷爾蒙為生
Zaps its victims with nymphoid hormones.

502
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,270
把他們變成自戀頑童無法控制異種能力
Turns them into self-obsessed brats too young for Fae powers.

503
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,340
所以 他們易受攻擊?
So, they're completely vulnerable to attack?

504
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,380
沒錯
Precisely.

505
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,520
那那些豬呢? 你派來的?
But what about the "Other white meat"? Relatives of yours?

506
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,790
感染源會發出刺激性荷爾蒙
The infected emit a pungent pheromone that attracts

507
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,620
吸引那些骯髒的下等異種來殺戮
a nasty breed of UnderFae in for the kill.

508
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,760
是啊 幸好肯吉用魔法小木棍把那小豬扭扭
Yeah, well, luckily Kenzi pounded little Piggly Wiggly

509
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,830
揍成了下等異種燻肉
into UnderFae bacon with her magic shillelagh.

510
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,660
- 那個賤女淫妖呢? - 還活蹦亂跳的呢
- And the Succubitch? - Still alive and singing.

511
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,900
還有兩個悲劇帝 戴森和他的新搭檔
Along with the other Twi-hards. Dyson and his new partner.

512
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,910
哦!事情真是越來越有趣了
Oh! Now this is getting interesting.

513
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:17,240
我最愛的三個人 被困在了一個地方
Three of my favorite people, trapped in one place...

514
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,780
無法自衛
with no way to defend themselves.

515
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,680
人類小女孩還拿著阿什的魔棒
And she's got The Ash's play stick.

516
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,320
想證明你對黑暗異族的忠誠嗎?
You want to prove your loyalty to the Dark?

517
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,540
把那腦殘三人組結果了吧
Finish off the teen trio,

518
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,590
然後把正義之杖帶回來給我
and bring me the Staff of Righteousness.

519
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,700
要是我做到了?
And if I do?

520
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,000
我可以保證幫你找幾個 初級崗位
I'm sure I could find some... entry level position...

521
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,100
做夢! 我要名至實歸 百萬現金
No! I want all titles restored ... A million in cash

522
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,060
還有我要拿回我的俱樂部 
and my club. I want it back.

523
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,540
這才是我認識的伐克斯
There's the Vex I remember.

524
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,250
"趕緊拿個武器"她如是說
"Grab a weapon", she said...

525
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,320
我已經解釋好多次了 肯吉 我不知道會這樣!
For the hundredth time, Kenzi, I didn't know!

526
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,420
知會媒體同胞 居然有完美醫生不知道的事情!
Alert the media, there is something Doctor Flawless doesn't know!

527
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,060
那是緊要關頭 肯吉
This is hardly the time, Kenzi.

528
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,590
當然不是 因為要是緊要關頭肯定早已一片狼藉
Course it isn't... 'Cause that would be "Messy"!

529
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,230
你不能來一次 一次也行 你能試著
Do you think just once! Maybe just once, you could try to be...

530
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,400
- 試著幹嘛? - 有所幫助!
- What? What?? - Helpful!

531
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,330
- 你說什麼? - 沒錯!
- Excuse me? - Sure!

532
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,100
因為大家都盡其所能
Because everybody else does!

533
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,920
你卻混混度日 沒工作 沒計劃 成天飲酒作樂
You just bounce through life, no job, no plan, from one beer

534
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,670
每個人都把你捧手心裡 難道不是?
to the next and still, everybody dotes on you, don't they?

535
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,310
他們寵誰礙著你什麼事了?
What do you care where they dote?

536
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,810
- 當我沒說 - 是啊 你這算什麼
- Just forget about it... - Yeah... what is that?!

537
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,740
你為什麼老用你那正常成長的經歷
Why are you always rolling your eyes at me,

538
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,550
和醫學學位翻白眼給我看
with your normal upbringing and your medical degree.

539
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,780
我過的是怎樣的生活你毫不知情 肯吉
You don't know anything about my life, Kenzi!

540
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,980
我知道你看不起我
I know you think you're too good for me...

541
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,820
不 我真沒有 是你覺得我配不上波
No, I don't actually! You think that I'm not good enough for Bo!

542
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,500
- 她是我閨蜜 - 可我也愛她
- She's my best friend. - And I love her.

543
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,430
我知道 我知道
I know! I know.

544
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,510
你確定我們沒被感染?
Are you sure we're not infected?

545
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,970
姆
Mmmm...

546
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,010
沒 我們只是
No. We're just...

547
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,110
犯傻
...stupid.

548
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,950
好吧 我還是喜歡"情緒化"一詞
Well, I prefer... ..."emotional".

549
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,960
不棄前嫌?
Moving on?

550
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,360
- 一起宰豬? - 好
- Killer Pig? - Yeah...

551
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,630
好的
Yep, okay...

552
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,500
我不敢相信我居然以為你不待見我
I can't believe I ever thought you didn't like me.

553
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,870
我不認為我能喜歡你
I don't think I was supposed to like you.

554
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,410
為什麼?你這是什麼意思?
Why? What do you mean?

555
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,210
我是瓦爾基裡
I'm a Valkyrie.

556
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,050
- 好像是 - 哇
- I think. - Wow...

557
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,250
真的?
Really?

558
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,920
- 瓦爾基裡是什麼? - 我不知道
- What's a Valkyrie? - I don't know.

559
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,780
但是 有時當我有所愛
But... sometimes when I like people,

560
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,060
我卻不得不放手
I have to make them go away.

561
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,900
- 你這是什麼意思? - 你會保守秘密嗎?
- What are you talking about? - Can you keep a secret?

562
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,770
至死不渝
Till I die.

563
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,340
姆
Um...

564
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,440
- 不 我不能說的 - 別 等等 等等!
- No, I'm not supposed to. - No, wait! Wait!

565
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,580
我有個主意 這樣
I have an idea! Okay...

566
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:26,520
我們把自己最黑暗 隱藏最深的秘密以詩的形式
Let's write down our deepest, darkest secrets...

567
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,890
寫下來
...in poetry.

568
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,560
酷!
Cool!

569
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,390
但要真的像首詩啊 要押韻的那種
But like real poetry. The kind that rhymes.

570
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,700
你真是個很好的人
You're really awesome.

571
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,240
不 你才是
No. You're really awesome.

572
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,910
額
Um...

573
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,510
哦 哦!
Oh, oh!

574
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,580
看到那豬臉了嗎?
See its snout?

575
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,720
它的遺傳結構與豬相似
It's similar in genetic makeup to the pig.

576
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,520
他以氣味捕食獵物 他知道我們之中
It was scenting out its prey, it knew which of us

577
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,720
誰感染了寄生蟲
was infected with the parasite.

578
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,250
塊菌豬威武霸氣
Hurray for the Truffle Pig.

579
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,650
這種生物群居為生
These creatures travel in packs.

580
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,060
當他們的兄弟沒有回去
When their buddy doesn't return...

581
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,390
他們就群攻?
They'll all go hog wild?

582
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,290
我們的魔法棒也不夠救咱們的
Not even my wonder whacker may be enough to save us.

583
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,030
所以我們需要波和其他人恢復正常
That's why we need Bo and the others back to normal.

584
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,600
根據我從伐克斯耳後的繭中提取的分泌物
Based on the secretions that I pulled from the cocoon

585
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,070
我可以湊出個寄生蟲的抗生素
from Vex, I think I can cobble together an anti-toxin

586
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,370
- 但我需要時間 - 也許還要個實驗室
- for the parasite. But I need time. - And a lab, maybe?

587
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,580
好吧 這倒不必 我工具箱裡有些基本配備
Well, not necessarily. I've got a few basic supplies in my kit.

588
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,910
但我需要你幫我去湊齊幾味配料
But I need you to gather up some ingredients.

589
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,450
呃 發酵粉 醋 薑黃
Uh, baking powder, vinegar, turmeric...

590
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,550
好 好 好的
Yeah, yeah, okay...

591
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,920
好了 說吧
Alright, go...

592
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,050
還有 大蒜 發膠和潤滑油
Also, garlic, hairspray, and lubricating oil.

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,490
加工的還是散裝的?
Flavoured or bulk?

594
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,590
至於我 我要去樓上採樣
As for me... I'm going upstairs to take a swab.

595
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,130
哇 哇 哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

596
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,230
醫生 你單槍匹馬的去了? 不帶個後援?
Doc, you goin' in solo? Without backup?

597
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,430
- 我能搞定 - 你的固執和專橫真是半斤八兩
- I think I can do this. - You're as stubborn as you are bossy.

598
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,470
祝你成功
Godspeed.

599
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:57,970
好吧!

600
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:07,650
- 發生什麼事了? - 不想說這個
- What happened? - I don't want to talk about it.

601
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,150
但是 我拿到樣本了
But... I got it.

602
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,420

- 做的不錯 - 是啊 我還會幹其他事
- Nice job. - Yeah, I did something else too...

605
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,230
我還在外面裝了一個預警系統 小鬼當家范兒
I set up an early warning system outside, Home Alone style.

606

Good. That'll help.

607
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,200
好了
Okay...

608
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,610
你肯定畢業於哪個瘋人醫學院
You must've gone to some crazy-ass medical school.

609
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:35,740
耶魯教會了我化學和生理學
Yale taught me chemistry and physiology.

610
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:40,010
但是這東西只是經驗和運氣
But this kind of stuff is just experience and luck

611
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,220
是我實地經驗琢磨出來的
and whatever I figured out in the field.

612
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,890
- 實地說的是 - 阿富汗
- "Field" Meaning... - Afghanistan.

613
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,620
要命 姐們
Shit, dude...

614
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,230
- 呆了多長時間 - 長到都忘記了
- How long? - Long enough.

615
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,730
- 你以前怎麼不曾提起? - 你又沒問
- Why didn't you ever say so? - You never asked.

616
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,740
你在聽戴森尿尿
You're listening to Dyson take a whiz.

617
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,140
我才沒有
I am not.

618
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,210
你讀了我的詩沒? 寫的很爛 是吧?
Did you read my poem? It was stupid, right?

619
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,750
沒 我喜歡 很喜歡
No, I liked it. A lot.

620
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,020
在某種程度上 你寫的很美
Yours was really beautiful... in a way.

621
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,560
但是這故事真的 真的很悲傷
But it was... really, really sad.

622
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,760
我真希望能做些什麼可以幫到你
I wish there was something I could do to help you.

623
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,660
你幫不了我的
You can't help me.

624
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,430
沒人幫得了我
Nobody can.

625
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
這是我們的秘密?
Our secret?

626
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,810
我發誓
Cross my heart.

627
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,920
請把我變成異妖吧
Make mine a Fae-cuccino, please...

628
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,430
我剛剛過濾了雜質 老天 我希望
I'm just straining any impurities. God, I hope...

三頭小豬駕到! 這回可是人為哦
The 3 little piggies are back! And this time, it's personal.

634
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,320

我要回家了
I'm going home.

636
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,000
- 你這虛偽的混蛋 - 噢

640
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,070
休想!
Not on your miserable life!

641
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,910
杜蘭杜蘭樂隊的歌?
Duran Duran?

642
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,700
波!救命!

我飢餓如狼
"...I'm hungry like the wolf!"

645
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,810

00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
玩過的轉瓶遊戲大不一樣啊
any Spin The Bottle game I ever played.

659

- 哦 規則更新了 - 你確定?

你們這是在玩轉瓶遊戲?
Are you playing Spin The Bottle?

664
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,460
爽斃了
That was so dope.

665
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,100
- 我們再來 - 好的

- 嘿 我們的披薩呢? - 不會有披薩了
- Hey, where's our pizza? - There's no pizza coming.

669
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,010
過來啊 你個小
Come here, you little...

670
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,810
啊哈
Ahh...

671
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,340
我覺得你要說的應該是傻瓜一詞
I believe "Wanker" Is the word that you're looking for.

672
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,550
你個卑鄙的叛徒
A dirty traitor!

673
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,620
想想我還和你共享了
And to think I shared my

674
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,820
我的限量版紫精靈閃粉
limited edition purple-pixie glitter with you!

675
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,920
哇 你以為共享化妝品就讓我們成朋友了?
Aw, you think sharing makeup makes us friends?

676
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,320
別這樣 你能自己做主
Don't do this... I thought you were your own man.

677
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,390
我的確是自己的主宰啊 而且我剛好有把斧頭
I am my own man! And I happen to have an axe.

678
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,160
但是你不是為了自己才幹這事的
But you're not doing this for you.

679
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,960
你這麼做是為了那個賤女人
You're doing it for that stupid bitch!

680
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,460
做什麼也比這有格調
Anything is better than this!

681
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,300
我是說 看看我! 我睡沙發!
I mean, look at me! I'm sleeping on a couch!

682
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,500
人們都當面嘲笑我!
People are laughing at me to my face!

683
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,000
你不能相信莫瑞根
You can't believe that The Morrigan's

684
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,070
她不會滿心歡喜的歡迎你

聽著 親愛的 明顯你也看過那本
Listen, luv, you've obviously read the book

686
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,910
人質談判第一章第一篇 所以我們能跳頁麼
on "Hostage Negotiation 101"... Can we just skip

687
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,510
說說我活成這樣哪裡好了
to the bit where you tell me I'm better than this?

688
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,680
- 這樣的你好 - 要是不好呢
- You are. - What if I'm not?

689
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,980
你失去了異種能力
Losing your powers was the

690
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,020
對你來說是最好的事情
best thing that could have happened to you.

691
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,220
我感覺我終於看到了真正的伐克斯
I feel like I've finally met the real Vex!

692
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:14,190
他是真正的藝術家! 他溫文爾雅!
He's a true artist. He's a gentle soul!

693
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,390
而且他不會被輕易愚弄 莫瑞根也不行
And he will not be trifled with. Not even by her!

694
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,000
他已經受夠了
He's done with that!

695
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,840
伐克斯 拜託!
Vex... please!

696
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,440

00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,300
我覺得被美人揍
I don't think I'd mind getting my ass kicked

705
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,310
- 我一定也不介意 - 可是很疼的

頭暈暈的 就像

718
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,180
的確發生了什麼 但是不記得了?
...like there's something there, but why can't I remember?

719
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,850
因為你本該忘記
Because you're not supposed to.

720
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,710
我們還是別糾結的好
We're probably better off this way.

721
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,180
是啊 注意不錯 塔米

聽著 我就知道最近這破事
Look, all I know is that this latest crapfest

724

You're kidding me.

Pro...

739
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,260
我看起來永遠很屌
I could be awesome, forever.

740
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,160
- 沒錯 - 好吧 壞處
- Yup. - Okay... Con...

741
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,360
我得開始學習慣用左手
I would have to learn how to do everything

742
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,070
我是說幹啥都得左手
with my left hand and I mean everything.

743
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:24,600
好吧 作為最後 有個免除條款
Well... as a last, desperate resort there is an escape clause.

744
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,740
選了 趕緊告訴我怎麼脫離這棍子
Sold. Show me the eject button.

745
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,340
好吧
Very well.

746
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,980
閉上眼然後跟我念 不准偷瞄
Close your eyes and say the words... No peeking.

747
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,750
我拒絕
"I decline".

748
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,560
我 拒絕
I... decline.

749
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,330
就這麼簡單?
It was that easy?

750
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,130
你怎麼不早說?
Why didn't you just say so?

751
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,100
幹嘛? 血聖就不能找樂子麼?
What? A Blood King can't have a little fun?

752
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,520
你的室內裝潢師水平真不咋地
I don't think much of your interior decorator...

753
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,190
這只是還在裝修中
It's a work in progress.

754
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,860
和你一樣
Much like yourself.

755
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,270
別轉移話題 這事還沒完
Don't change the subject. You're not off the hook yet.

756
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,200
哦 看看你 瞬間老成相的阿什
Oh! Look at you. All grown up. "The Ash."

757
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,900
你有印新商務名片麼
Did you get the new business cards,

758
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,440
也許買了車辦了自選車牌
yet? Maybe a little vanity plate?

759
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,310
- 當爹的好光榮 - 你違反了異種法律
- Daddy must be so proud. - You violated Fae law.

760
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,880
哦 就逗逗淫妖這點小事麼?
Oh, by having a little fun with SuccuBo?

761
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,980
你招搖過市攻擊光明異族
You executed a blatant attack on the Light.

762
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,950
哦 拜託 啥時候大家都這麼神經過敏了?
Oh, come on now. When did everyone get so uptight?

763
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,580
我仍記得當年
I remember the good old days.

764
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,360
小搶小鬧
A little raping, a little pillaging,

765
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,790
古怪的"附帶損壞"
the odd "Collateral damage"...

766
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,720
然後再給自己辦個派對
and then you'd have yourself a party.

767
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,390
現在幹嘛都是規則 規則
Now it's all rules, rules, rules.

768
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,360
你的行為會破壞新的和平計劃
Your actions may have jeopardized the new peace plan.

769
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,730
怕你忘記 提醒你一下 這計劃
A plan, in case you've forgotten,

770
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,430
是由異種長老們決議通過的
that was endorsed by the Fae Elders themselves.

771
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,930
我能說什麼?
What can I say?

772
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,970
除了 我錯了
Except, mea culpa.

773
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,840
我就是想為生活添點情趣
I was just trying to spice things up a little bit.

774
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,280
我做了三十年的警察了
I was a cop for thirty years.

775
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,980
學會一件事 屁話臭不可聞
One thing I learned... bullshit stinks.

776
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,550
女士 你臭氣熏天了
And lady, you reek.

777
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,850
你要是再敢耍花招
You ever pull a stunt like this again,

778
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,310
我會親自宰了你
I will personally rip off

779
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,860
讓你好看
your head and shove it up your lily white ass.

780
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,010
這次緊張局面緩和相當重要
This detente is important to be screwed up

781
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,930
不能被瑣碎的小爭執給破壞了
by some petty feud.

782
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,400
聽清楚了沒?
Am I clear?

783
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,400
明白了
Crystal.

784
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,740
嗨 兄弟 我們剛從伐克斯缺席的嘉年華上回來
Hey man, we are just one Vex short of a real fiesta.

785
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,240
你要去哪兒?
Where you goin'?

786
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,180
還不知道
I don't know yet.

787
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,510
我去泡點茶
Why don't I go make some tea.

788
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,550
伐克斯親 嗨 拜託 我們都不計前嫌了
Vexster... hey! Come on, all is forgiven.

789
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,220
不能 肯吉
But it shouldn't be, Kenz.

790
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,650
我不能住這兒了 在我做了這樣的事之後
I can't stay here. Not after what I've done.

791
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,890
老兄 你救了我的命
Dude, you saved my life...

792
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,530
那只是那豬剛好移到了左邊
Or that pig shifted to the left at just the right moment.

793
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,260
才不是
That is not true.

794
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,760
不是 對吧
Is it??

795
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:08,870
你懂得
You know...

796
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,210
如果我翻過我的歷史 你就會知道我是個賭徒
if you'd looked at my history you'd know I was a betting man.

797
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,540
我要花點時間自舔傷口 你知道嗎?
I'm going to take some time to reflect, you know?

798
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,380
重啟系統 我猜醫生說得對!
Reset the system. I guess the Doctor was right!

799
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,510
見鬼的人類
Bloody humans...

800
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,660
- 你這是要去西藏? - 印度 路經維加斯
- You thinkin' maybe Tibet? - India, via Vegas.

801
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,160
你懂得 整個美食 祈禱 催眠之旅
You know, the whole Eat, Pray, Mesmer tour.

802
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:40,630

全副武裝 準備就緒
Fully armed and ready to rock.

804
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,900
那我什麼時候才能再見你?
How do I know I'll ever see you again?

805
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,920
不會是你黑檀木手柄豬鬃胭脂刷吧?
Not your ebony handled bison bristle blush brush?

806
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,490
呃
Ugh!

807
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,350
你要是搞壞了 我非殺了你不可
You break that brush and I'll kill ya.

808
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,020
嗷
Ow!

809
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,830
來世再見 也許
Catch you in another lifetime! Maybe...

810
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,870
我會想念那混蛋的
I'm gonna miss that a-hole...

811
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:21,600
我知道
I know.

812
