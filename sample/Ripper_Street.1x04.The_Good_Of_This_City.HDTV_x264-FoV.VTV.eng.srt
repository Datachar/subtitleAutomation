1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,558
Your cleanliness is your
responsibility, but I expect it
taken serious. I shall advise on

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,278
girdle, corsage, garter and bustle,
advice by which you will abide if
you wish to thrive. Now the house

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,078
takes 60% of all earnings. It is a
good sight less than most, girl.

4
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:20,638
In return, you shall find yourself
free from harassment of any kind.

5
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:22,918
If you have a complaint to make,
I will take your side,

6
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:25,118
no matter the grounds
nor the Thomas in question.

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,360
In short, you will find yourself
fed, safe and solvent.

8
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,279
Think on it. Return once you have.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,640
Yes, ma'am.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,120
Lucy!

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,320
Oh, Lucy!

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,199
Oh, darling.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,078
I'll sweep and scrub the floors,
change the girls' linen,

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,118
cook for them, do whatever
you ask of me.

15
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,920
Ah, Lucy. You, a char? You would
make step-sisters of my girls

16
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:54,439
and I would have mutiny in a week.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,798
Now, tell me. Where have you been
these last years?

18
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,880
Did one of our gentlemen
make you his own?

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,079
Lucy? Please, Miss Susan.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,560
Will you not let me work?

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,600
You know I cannot.

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,720
Then I know not
what will become of me.

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,839
Lucy, look at you.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,358
The truth of this world is that
men have designed it

25
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,640
for their own purpose and pleasure.

26
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:26,439
And you, my darling,
there is not one primitive desire

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,280
in their child-like minds
that you do not fulfil.

28
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:31,679
Which is my curse, miss...

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,919
one from which
all the world profit...

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,199
save myself...

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,760
and one, it seems,
I cannot now escape.

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,120
Christ on a pony.

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,400
Um...

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,119
Dead. Murdered.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,480
Who is, lady?

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,800
It's all right. It's all right.

37
00:02:35,642 --> 00:03:05,597
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,279
Two shillings is all. You spend less
on butter, more perhaps on ale.

39
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,198
But a drop or three will raise
you up when you need raising

40
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,000
and it's going to bring you
peace after.

41
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,919
Help! Help me, somebody.

42
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,279
Hell's bells! Fetch the inspector!

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,440
Come sit down here, Miss.
What you been up to?

44
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:26,999
Lucy? What is this? Who is she?

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,719
Her name's Lucy. Lucy Eames.

46
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,400
Known to you how? How do you think?
She was one of Susan's.

47
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:36,959
Lucy. Blood's not hers, thank God.
Then whose?

48
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,439
Sir, she spoke of murder.

49
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,679
Two murders. Where, girl?

50
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,359
Dog's Neck.

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,079
Dog's Neck.

52
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,000
It's what they call the rookery
off the back of Cable.
St George's Cross? That's right, sir.

53
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:52,519
That slum's due to meet
the wrecking crew today.

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,360
Can we get a blanket? Give me a
blanket. Miss, come here. Come here.

55
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,359
Miss, you see this whiskered
gentleman here?

56
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,200
His name is Mr Artherton. You have
need of anything, you ask him.

57
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,398
She may deserve them. She may not.

58
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,438
Best not take chances. Quite so.

59
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,958
Sergeant, that girl's
no stranger to restraints.

60
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,918
Get the telegraph singing. See if
any of our brethren had any cause

61
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,480
to lock up a Lucy Eames.

62
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,360
Tart, I believe. Yes, sir.

63
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,240
She's one of Miss Hart's
girls, you say?

64
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,719
Was. When? Two years ago maybe.

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,838
Susan found her lifting her drawers
for the hauliers on Limehouse Cut,

66
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,600
took her in, fed her, waited
till she was 16, let her loose.

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,320
She was something, Reid.

68
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:59,839
Men stood in line half-way
to Hoxton. Lucky girl.

69
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,400
So why did they stop queuing?

70
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,080
Get these people out of here.
Come on. Move along.

71
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,598
It's all coming down today
whether you're out or not.

72
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:16,040
Order of S&C Railways.

73
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,679
Police coming through.
Stand aside, gentlemen.

74
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,160
Excuse me, madam. Stand aside.

75
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,359
Move! Out!

76
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,680
You, out!

77
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,319
He's gone. Though not long since.

78
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,240
Still warm. You. You stand there
and watch this man bleed out?

79
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:49,400
That man... I did.

80
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,839
Who is he? Name's Roach.

81
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Collected rents hereabout.

82
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,600
What use was he on the day
this building comes down?

83
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:04,999
Whatever it was,
they raised hell about it.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,240
She calling him a devil,
he swearing to end her

85
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:11,439
if she didn't pipe herself down.
The woman?

86
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,998
Yeah, Maggie Eames.
This is her place.

87
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,118
And those her children
that wail out there?

88
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:18,078
Them and their whore of a sister.

89
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,560
Sergeant, get them out of here.
Have a man take them to their sister
at Leman Street. Yes, sir.

90
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,359
You have the tart?

91
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,079
You saw her? She was seen...

92
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,560
walking out of here like
she'd washed herself in his blood.

93
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:34,719
You take note of any other?

94
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,239
On this day?! Amongst this exodus?

95
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,720
Satan himself could have sauntered
through and no man remark on it.

96
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:45,319
Your name? Denton.

97
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,279
Wait outside.
Sergeant, shut the door.

98
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,000
Constable, keep hold of this man.
Yes, sir.

99
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,160
So, she smashes
the bottle into his head.

100
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,399
She stabs his throat with it.

101
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,519
He staggers, he shoots...

102
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,839
No. What?

103
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,639
This wound, the skin,
subcutaneous fat...

104
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,758
See how clean it's penetrated?
She stabbed him with that bottle,

105
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,640
the work would be jagged and the
flesh scragged. This is a lancing.

106
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:22,639
Just one precise thrust.

107
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,519
Miss Eames, then.

108
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,440
She had no blade on her
when she arrived.

109
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:29,160
She could've ditched it. Certainly.

110
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,919
But...

111
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,360
But she would have struggled to
reach him from where she stood.

112
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:38,040
Lucy stood...

113
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,719
here.

114
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,359
See the arc of arterial blood?

115
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,958
The heart's beat projects it
from his severed artery,

116
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,238
strikes this wall, this wall,
this window...

117
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:52,200
Then hits the girl,
leaving that gap.

118
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:54,200
Give the man a cigar.

119
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,319
He was cut from behind
by someone else.

120
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,279
Go on. She hits him with
the gin bottle, blam. He shoots.

121
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,639
Gets stabbed from behind. He turns.
He falls with the stripe of blood.

122
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,798
Towards Lucy. But he shoots
and misses. See that?

123
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:15,520
Missing because he's turning,
aiming for another. Blam.

124
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,439
Blam.

125
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,479
Blam.

126
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,399
Blam. Towards whoever cut him.

127
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
Where's the last? The sixth?

128
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,440
Lower than the others, sir. It is.

129
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,839
It is, but... was it diverted?

130
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,120
By what?

131
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,479
You see this, Captain?

132
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,918
We have six bullets.
We have one in her head.

133
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,878
Four passing directly into the wall
in a correlating tangent.

134
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,600
And the last, the sixth, perhaps
diverted through this window.

135
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,680
Then that's the slug we need.

136
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
Got ya.

137
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,320
It did pass through a body
on its way out. It's blooded.

138
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,519
Then...

139
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,800
a fourth stood...

140
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,998
here. In their hand,
the knife that killed this man

141
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:25,798
and with him the answer as to why
he blew this woman's brains
out of her before he died.

142
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,798
These bodies, mark where they lay
and they are for your dead room.

143
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,798
Sergeant, keep this room sealed.
There will be truth in it,

144
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,480
but we must work it
inch by every inch to find it.

145
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,799
You're police?

146
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,680
My name is Stanley Bone of the LCC.

147
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,639
Mine Reid. H Division.

148
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,440
What does it brings a board
member of our new county council
out to a slum clearance?

149
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:55,479
Do you offer your home
to those here rendered without?

150
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,360
Mr Reid, I am advocate
for the railway company

151
00:09:58,361 --> 00:10:00,159
that makes this incursion.

152
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,798
Whatever has called you here
takes place on its land.

153
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,960
It is murder that calls me here.

154
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:07,479
Murder? Of who?

155
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,400
Of a rent collector and tenant.

156
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,919
I am sorry, Inspector.

157
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,079
But whilst I pray
for the poor departed,

158
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,718
that building comes down today.

159
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:21,078
No longer. It stays upright
until I know what took place there.

160
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,838
And these workmen
will stand idle on full wage

161
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,000
while you discern the details
of a rent dispute?

162
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,960
Whatever it is that's discerned
here, yes, they will.

163
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,760
Or are you not also
advocate of the police?

164
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,559
Yes, of course.

165
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,440
You must do your duty, Inspector.

166
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,799
How now, Inspector? Come to see
the march of progress, have we?

167
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,718
Those who now must find
their shelter where they can?

168
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:53,960
That your story, is it?
Oh, I am a man of compassion.

169
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:58,479
The benighted souls who must
make their lives in such places

170
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,080
or meet their deaths there.

171
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,038
Just a name or two, Inspector, eh?

172
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,318
Someone here shall
tell me eventually.
Why should it not be you?

173
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:11,480
Because I would make your life
harder than it need be, Mr Best.

174
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:12,800
Not the reverse.

175
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,958
It'll be all right, Lucy.
It'll be all right.

176
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,558
Artherton, a Maria
for St George's Cross.

177
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,680
Have Captain Jackson return
with all... speed.

178
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:37,480
There, there. Come on. Shush.

179
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,560
What's brought you here?

180
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:44,239
Erm, our Lucy, Inspector.

181
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,600
Miss Susan sent me to check on her.
And how do you find her?

182
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,279
As you see her, Mr Reid.
Just... silent in her distress.

183
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,840
Get home, girl. Yes, sir.

184
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,998
She seemed calmed
by the girl's presence, sir.

185
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:08,200
I thought it conducive. Never mind
that, Artherton. Have you traced
her? Not myself, sir. The lad.

186
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, Hobbs?

187
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,919
Well, it's only that the girl
seems sad, to me, sir.

188
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,319
Not bad. No. And like you said,
she's worn irons before now,

189
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,638
so I did a round of the asylums.
And you found knowledge of her?

190
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,918
Yes, sir. The Lark House
at Bethnal Green.

191
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,880
And do they send someone?
A Dr Crabbe comes.

192
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,959
Karl Crabbe himself? Sir.

193
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,518
He's made a progress with hysterics

194
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,280
that no other doctor
of the mind has yet.

195
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,078
Good work, Hobbs. You did right.

196
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:42,598
Choose two men,
take a Maria to Sergeant Drake.
He'll have instructions for you.

197
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,440
Yes, sir. Give me the keys
to those cuffs.

198
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,680
Sit.

199
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,000
No. No, child. That is not what
is... required of you here.

200
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,560
Are you wounded in any way?

201
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,919
Sit.

202
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,239
All I want from you is to talk.

203
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,840
Whatever pleases you, sir.

204
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,040
Drink this.

205
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,960
Can you remember what it was
brought you here?

206
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:47,359
What happened at the Dog's Neck?

207
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,319
My mama killed, sir.

208
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,560
Not just your mother.

209
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,279
A man, too.

210
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,120
Yes. Do you know him?

211
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,520
What did you see?

212
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,760
Forgive me, Miss Eames.
His blood was shed all upon you.

213
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,360
May I go now, sir?

214
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,600
Where is it that you think
you are, Lucy?

215
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,560
I forget.

216
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,120
Your mama, this man...

217
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,599
Help me help you and think.

218
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,640
What did you see?

219
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,520
Just my darkness.

220
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,760
When I woke up,
they were there laid before me.

221
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:47,600
And not another soul? No-one.
You are sure?

222
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,800
There's nothing that
I'm sure of in this world, sir.

223
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,120
Lucy, you are aware that
you are with child, are you not?

224
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,400
Dr Crabbe.

225
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,760
Lucy!

226
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,319
Mr Reid.

227
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,679
Sir.

228
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,838
I heard you speak last month.
At Lincoln's Inn.

229
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,118
At the college! A man I know told me
I droned that day.

230
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,720
He cannot have been listening.

231
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,119
And now you have found
and cared for our Lucy.

232
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,039
Dr Crabbe, you should know,

233
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,240
Miss Eames'
mother is killed this day.

234
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,679
Oh, my poor dear girl.

235
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,560
And another man, too, the name of
Roach. Do you know him, sir?

236
00:15:46,561 --> 00:15:48,879
No, I do not. Was Lucy present?

237
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,039
She was.

238
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,560
But remembers not a thing?

239
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,638
Get both these bodies
to my dead room!

240
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,720
The man who drops them will
be assisting me at autopsy.

241
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,600
No! Wait! Wait!

242
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,160
Take them away now! Hurry! Hurry!

243
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,760
Reid, I... I'm sorry.

244
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,359
She is epileptic?

245
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,319
She is ailed by that, yes.
Other conditions, also.

246
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,358
Inspector, I know you must
question her further

247
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:39,360
but I would lodge her in my care
until you next have need of her.

248
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,998
Artherton, prepare the papers.

249
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:44,400
Davis, can we lift her?

250
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:46,519
Thank you.

251
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,760
There Lucy.
All is well, all is well.

252
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,598
Dr Crabbe,
one last question before you go.

253
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,798
For how long has Miss Eames
been a patient of yours?

254
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,598
A little over two years now,

255
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:05,118
but she is not permanently
resident with me.

256
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,718
You keep no watch over her?

257
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:10,438
Inspector, to find her health,
it is of considerable importance

258
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,998
that Lucy's life feel
as commonplace as yours or mine.

259
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,360
That cannot be the case if she feel
we assess her every move.

260
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:20,239
When she is ill, she comes to me.

261
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,160
When well, she lives as she pleases.

262
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,680
Excuse me.

263
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,399
Sir. These nippers?

264
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,118
I have an idea where they may rest

265
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,600
until we know better what will
become of them.

266
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,959
Miss Goren? Miss Goren, I am sorry.
I come to impose on you once more.

267
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,959
Oh! We are friends now, Inspector.

268
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,000
You must never apologise
for your visit.

269
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,519
This is Betsy.

270
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,680
Hello, Betsy!

271
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,360
Girls, say hello to Betsy.

272
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,758
What is this poor child's story?

273
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,278
Er, her mother is dead
and her sister...

274
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,720
Her sister is of
no use to her for now.

275
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:22,359
No father or uncle?

276
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,638
It's men that are the ruin of this
family, Miss Goren.

277
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,320
Oh, this family and many like them,
Inspector.

278
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,079
You disagree?

279
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,640
No, no. No, merely,
my wife would say the same.

280
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,079
Mrs Reid must be a woman of great
sense and clarity.

281
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,999
She is that, yes.

282
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,800
Then I would like to meet her.

283
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,480
My many thanks again, Miss Goren.

284
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,000
If I have news,
you'll be the first to know.

285
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,839
You remember, Lucy? Your room?

286
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,040
Just as it ever was.

287
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,318
'Strange, were like she weren't
even there.

288
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,840
'Barely even recognised me.'

289
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,358
Anyways, I don't know why you're
getting yourself in such a palaver
about her.

290
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,438
Think she gave two tosses for you
when she swanned off like
Ellen Terry herself?

291
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,320
She was worth ten of you, girl.

292
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,320
Oh, Rose, come here, come here.
I'm so sorry.

293
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,720
I fear for her.
And I blame myself.

294
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,759
Get Reid, Sergeant.

295
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,159
Yes, Commissioner Munro.

296
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,200
Two issues, Reid.

297
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,599
One, whoever did this. From behind.

298
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,558
They had to push upwards
from underneath to do so.

299
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,958
So I reckon they would be shorter.
The blade's about four inches.

300
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:38,840
A good point, a switch-blade most
likely. A well-made one.

301
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:40,359
The second issue?

302
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,320
This woman.

303
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,920
There are fibroids in her womb.

304
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,319
Explain.

305
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,359
It's like cankers.
Over time they deform the uterus.

306
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,079
The children?

307
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,319
She ain't been
confined for over ten years.

308
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,080
So what then? Are they Lucy's?

309
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,598
Commissioner Munro
calls for you, Sir.

310
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,320
You're to go with him to
the Dog's Neck railway excavation.

311
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,238
They are but a few weeks old,

312
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:22,280
but these places already have
the chill of eternity.

313
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,399
Why bring me here, Sir?

314
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,960
Just hear the man out, Reid.
His concern should be ours, also.

315
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,960
Inspector. Inspector, please!

316
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,438
Thank you for responding
so speedily to my invitation.

317
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,238
Yourself in particular, Inspector.

318
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:46,998
Get to it, Bone, I have two
murders above us need investigation.

319
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:50,198
And I will have you returned to them
in short order, Mr Reid.

320
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:52,678
As soon as you've seen just
what is built here.

321
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,480
Track is laid. For a railway.
It is nothing new.

322
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,719
Perhaps not new.
But newly efficient.

323
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,280
Every man -
a yard back from the line!

324
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,199
500 volts run beneath the rivers
of the junction at Liverpool Street,

325
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,799
split there to travel east,
west and onwards, Mr Reid.

326
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,158
Onwards, for ever. Down the next
century and the one that follows -

327
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,678
an organism of transport.

328
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,958
Every borough connected,
one to the other.

329
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:38,558
The poor, sir -
not simply the rich - will travel,

330
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,158
for the cost of half a pot of jam,
from one end of our city to another.

331
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,118
Their everyday horizon extended,

332
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,798
their aspirations improved
accordingly.

333
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,600
Mr Bone, I have never contested
the value of this machinery
to people's lives.

334
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:51,799
Then assist it.

335
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,598
Inspector, the investment structure
we have constructed for this

336
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,958
venture, it is as reticulated
as the network we would build.

337
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:01,398
Each section of line
has a completion guarantee.

338
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:04,478
That guarantee fulfilled, the next
tranche of capital is released.

339
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:06,920
Should the demolition crew above
ground stand idle

340
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:11,559
for many hours more, we risk
the collapse of the entire venture.

341
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,800
I beg you, sir. I beg you.

342
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,520
Let them proceed.

343
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,518
Good day to you, fine sirs.

344
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,678
Who is this gentleman?

345
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,078
His name is Best.
He writes for The Star.

346
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,718
You know me not, Councillor.
But I come to know you, Sir.

347
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,078
This is private land.

348
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:32,118
Remove yourself or Inspector Reid
shall do so with his boot.

349
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,518
And this here is common land from
which I shall ask Mr Bone
my questions,

350
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,160
of how he feels,
four months into its life,

351
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:40,399
our new county council proceeds.

352
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,919
If its civic enlightenments are
not compromised by the...

353
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,079
commercial instincts of its
councillors.

354
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,198
I shall not stand here
and listen to these insinuations.

355
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:53,358
Everything we do,
we do for the good of this city

356
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,960
and the benefit of those who
build their lives within it.

357
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:58,279
Commissioner, Inspector.

358
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,998
I'm sure they appreciate
your dedication, sir.

359
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:04,040
Yes, the sacrifices you have made
to your own life.

360
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:08,519
Your wife, watching the sea roll in
all alone down in Hove.

361
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,639
No children to comfort you.

362
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,560
The pleasures of a home life
foregone in pursuit of others'
happiness.

363
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:16,319
It must ail you, Sir.

364
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,760
It must play on those
finely-tuned nerves of yours.

365
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,920
Or do you find other
ways of easing that pain...?

366
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,119
Best! Enough. Get gone.

367
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,359
Whatever you say, Inspector.

368
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,120
But do not think me gone long.

369
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,160
For myself, Mr Bone's vision of
a liberal city commune is of little
bearing.

370
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,399
No, sir.

371
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,678
What is of greater importance to me
is this -

372
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,238
that each occasion a slum is
raised to the ground,

373
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:50,078
it is replaced by the type of brick
and clean steel on which

374
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,998
the bacteria of the criminal classes
can no longer fester.

375
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:57,440
The greater the number of homeless
we send to the wider world,

376
00:24:57,441 --> 00:25:00,319
the faster our measure
of crime falls.

377
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,118
You have my meaning, inspector.

378
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,718
Whatever it is your men do in that
rookery, it stops by end of day

379
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:08,280
or they will find themselves
amidst the rubble.

380
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,879
'There will be sign.'

381
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,598
This person might have vanished
as if a ghost,

382
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,118
but a ghost they are not.

383
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,918
Wherever they have passed, the space
through which they have done so must
bear witness.

384
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,360
We three - we take one more
pass of this place together.

385
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,160
On your knees, then.

386
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,759
Oh.

387
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,520
What, Hobbs? What is it?

388
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,520
It's gin, Sir.

389
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,919
Sir? Look at this, blonde hair.

390
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,760
The mother's, most likely.

391
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,279
What's that?

392
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,519
It's a herb.

393
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,639
Dropped. Brushed aside.

394
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,400
One that I have smelled before.

395
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,558
Hobbs. It's time we knew
more about our dead Mr Roach.

396
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,118
Get to Companies House. Find out what
you can about his work,

397
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:37,798
whether he collected on his own
behalf or for others. Sir.

398
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,398
Sergeant - you're with me.

399
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,760
I have a notion of what may
have passed here.

400
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,440
That's for upstairs, cheeky.

401
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,000
Sergeant Drake!

402
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,040
Get your skinny prick out of here!

403
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,720
Fetch Miss Susan!

404
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,439
Will you arrest me, Sir?

405
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,840
No, girl.

406
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,200
I hope he's not left you
out of pocket.

407
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,919
Mr Drake,
you do say the funniest things.

408
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,959
Your mistress. Where is she?

409
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,398
This had best be a raid.

410
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:20,918
If you've come simply to say
your good-evenings, I shall
be seeking compensation.

411
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:23,520
No good-evenings.
This is not a raid, either.

412
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:25,599
I seek an interview, Madam.

413
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,919
This way.
But leave your sergeant down there.

414
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,320
He may moon at my girl gratis.

415
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,880
I'll be outside sir.

416
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,760
Your accomplice's very own suite.

417
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,999
Will you indulge me, Miss Hart?

418
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,120
Allow me to weary you with some
details of my day?

419
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:05,240
You? Weary me, Inspector?

420
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,399
That girl you once ran.

421
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,600
Lucy. A good girl.

422
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,280
She left for what
we hoped were better times.

423
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:16,359
Better or no,

424
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,878
she appears this morning
at my station, striped in blood,

425
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:20,798
keening after her dead mother.

426
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,960
I've heard of it.
And I mourn for her.

427
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,240
Hmm. Yes.

428
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
And the man, too, Roach.

429
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,639
His carotid opened with
a stab of a honed switch-blade?

430
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,558
I prefer you spare me
that imagery, Mr Reid.

431
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,680
Your sensitivities
affronted, are they?

432
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,120
This plant on Captain Jackson's desk.

433
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:45,600
What of it?

434
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,079
Pennyroyal, is it not?

435
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,598
What that man keeps in this room,
I find I prefer not to inquire.

436
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,320
Then perhaps I might educate you?

437
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:57,999
I'd be honoured.

438
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,960
Pennyroyal, when brewed strong as an
infusion, may bring on miscarriage.

439
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,799
I confess I am surprised a woman in
your line of work, ignorant of this.

440
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,400
What can I say, Mr Reid?
We are cautious in this house.

441
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,518
Miss Eames is, I would say,
a little under three month pregnant.

442
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,480
Then I mourn for her once more.

443
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,080
As I say - cautious.

444
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,399
You best attend to that, Susan.

445
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,480
A bullet wound might soon go septic.

446
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,758
Think of the names I can speak of!

447
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,638
The many men of yours whose
pleasure's been found in my house!

448
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:40,878
Those ranked higher than you...!
Will you get her locked down!

449
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:44,000
You! And you! And you have all been
guests in my house!

450
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,440
With me, Jackson.

451
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,879
No, Reid!

452
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,480
I swear it, I have no clue as to
what she's doing here.

453
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,759
How skilled you are, Captain.

454
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,840
Your claims to know nothing of what
takes place beneath your own roof.

455
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,879
I am dismayed at myself,

456
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,880
that I would trust a man
so transparently false.

457
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,519
The two of you - you and Susan -
the lies that you hide behind,

458
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,200
lies that I have allowed
to go untested.

459
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:28,359
Allowed in the foolish instinct
that some good might come from it!

460
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,240
That you might be worth the faith
that I have placed in you!

461
00:31:32,241 --> 00:31:33,519
I am, Reid.

462
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,400
You are in a rage
and I understand that rage, but I...

463
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,599
No.

464
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,360
You knew of her guilt and a man who
holds secrets is a secretive man.

465
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,038
And you have the right
to pronounce on that, do you?

466
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,760
That mess about your shoulder.

467
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,960
All who have laid eyes on it,
every man in this station

468
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:03,639
too afraid to talk about it even
amongst themselves.

469
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,320
Does Drake enquire after it?

470
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:08,679
Because I'd lay
money on it that he doesn't.

471
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,760
Well, that's loyalty for you, Reid.

472
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,078
A dog unable to question the pain
or motivation of the man

473
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,798
that it tails about the place.

474
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,880
Well, I shall ask you. I'd hear you
speak of what befell your girl...

475
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,199
You ever speak of her again,
I shall not trouble myself with

476
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,399
asking after the secrets
of your life, Captain.

477
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,558
I shall chain you in a cell
underground

478
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,880
and take billy club to you
until they pour from you like water.

479
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,680
Am I clear?

480
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,200
Am I?

481
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,200
My innocence in all this?

482
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,399
There is a suspect down the way
with a bullet wound,

483
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,080
requiring
disinfection and needlework.

484
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,800
'You make no attempt to
hide your guilt.'

485
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:14,799
Why should I?
I feel no shame for the act.

486
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,678
The animal had killed the woman,
was set to do the same to Lucy.

487
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,638
I did only as you would have done,
Inspector.

488
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:21,318
I should take your word for that?

489
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,520
Take what you will, Inspector.
It is the truth.

490
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:25,519
Careful, Quack!

491
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,999
The truth, and the two of you?

492
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,880
Three unlikelier bedfellows a man
would struggle to find. Indeed.

493
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:34,239
You ask your questions, Mr Reid.

494
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,840
I will answer and then you may
decide if I do so truthfully or no.

495
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,038
What brought you to Dog's Neck?

496
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,478
Lucy. She invited you?

497
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,840
I followed her there. From?

498
00:33:43,841 --> 00:33:44,960
Tenter Street.

499
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,319
Two years and not a word,

500
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,758
not a solitary clue as to
whether she lived or breathed.

501
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:56,080
Then, dressed fine as a lady,
she knocks on my door.

502
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:57,559
What did she want?

503
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,999
Her old room back.

504
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,038
But she was dressed fine, you say?

505
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,318
I have no explanation for it,
Sergeant, just the fact of it.

506
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:06,278
Then what did you say to her, Susan?

507
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,640
That, thoroughbred or no,

508
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:12,320
three months pregnant, she was
no use whatsoever to your stable.

509
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,239
Then what?

510
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,719
Why ask me?

511
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,439
I imagine, being fond of her,
you felt remorse.

512
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,278
And you hurried after the girl,
Pennyroyal in hand,

513
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:26,638
to tell her that, were she to find
herself free of her burden,

514
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,720
she might once again be welcome.

515
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:29,760
Hmm?

516
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,840
But it is what you found there
that interests me the most.

517
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,240
I heard her from the street.

518
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,440
She raged at him. Margaret?

519
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,079
On what topic?

520
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,798
They were flattening the place.

521
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:51,320
He wanted his dues before
they did so.

522
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:52,360
No.

523
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,079
She screamed
of what she knew of him.

524
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,678
And that she would be silent
no longer.

525
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,880
And he said that she would
if she knew what would
allow her to keep on breathing.

526
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:06,799
I heard glass break.

527
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,680
The bottle against his head?

528
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:10,679
The reports of a revolver.

529
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,999
Lucy screaming. You entered.

530
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,879
Lucy was hysteric.

531
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,440
You produced your blade.

532
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,200
You cut...

533
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,080
from behind.

534
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,480
And what of Lucy?

535
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,240
I left her there.

536
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,800
Squirming in the dirt.

537
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,639
Why d'you stare?
It is a case solved. Reid.

538
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,918
No longer, American, away with ya.

539
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:05,638
Reid, do you intend to
charge her on this?

540
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,998
For saving a girl's life?

541
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,520
A man was killed by her hand.

542
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:10,639
A slumlord ape set on murder.

543
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,959
Still a man.

544
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,640
And you never thought it worth
asking why this man took

545
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,559
a pistol to this woman.

546
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,158
Or whose threat he carried with him?

547
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:23,558
Captain Jackson, I shall be
the master of all enquiries
I make of myself.

548
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,960
Door, please, Sergeant.

549
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,160
Is it worth asking?
Do you think, sir?

550
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,880
Yes, Bennet. I suspect it is.

551
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,359
David, be quiet.
Down and sleep. Goodnight.

552
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,400
Goodnight, Miss. Good night,
good night. Sleep!

553
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:06,199
'Go'natt. Sov Gott.

554
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,719
Oh, Ellie, I have your dolly.

555
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,799
There... tuck down. Good night.

556
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,160
Go to sleep. Good night.

557
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,360
Oh, no!

558
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,920
Betsy, Betsy.

559
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,160
Betsy? Betsy?

560
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,600
Miss Goren?

561
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,720
It seems all I bring to you is
violence and distress.

562
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,280
Find the children, please,
Inspector.

563
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,879
Lucy Eames.

564
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,398
Two years since, you say she walked
away from your house with no warning?
I do.

565
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,560
The oldest child found in that room,
I guess she approached that age.

566
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:33,319
Do you agree? Mmm.

567
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,878
Then I suggest this to you.

568
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:38,198
That you cast her out for the same
reason you cast her out
this day just passed,

569
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:42,000
that she was pregnant
and no longer welcome in your house.

570
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,999
You think me callous, Inspector.
And perhaps I am that.

571
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,800
But I loved that girl like a sister.

572
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,200
And she never did say what
took her away.

573
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:07,800
But I had my theories.

574
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,159
Proceed.

575
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,719
The first of her... attacks...
The fits from which she suffers?

576
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,640
It had come two months previous.
Near scared the Thomas with whom she
was engaged, to his death.

577
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:23,239
There were more?

578
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,319
Perhaps five, graver too.

579
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,839
We found her gone the day after
the last one had left her.

580
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,440
My belief? She went to
find their remedy.

581
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,800
Gentlemen, please, come this way.

582
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:22,359
In the treatment you
conducted with her,

583
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,800
did she speak at all of
children born unto her?

584
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,080
She did not.

585
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,199
Nor of the child
she carries in her belly now?

586
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,680
Mr Reid, my patients -
past, present, future...

587
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,200
I have no family of my own
and as a consequence,

588
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:45,839
they are doubly precious to me.

589
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,599
Such love means I will not
judge them nor demand their secrets.

590
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,919
They come to me,
arms wide for assistance

591
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,599
and I render it without condition.

592
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,639
Until Lucy chooses freely to tell me

593
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,038
the details of her life away from
here, I will not ask her of them.

594
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:06,640
Then that - and I hope you will
forgive me for this, doctor -

595
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:08,480
that must be my task.

596
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,840
Lucy.

597
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,000
I bring greetings from Miss Susan.

598
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,119
Miss Susan is a lady.

599
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,119
As are you, Lucy.

600
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:41,079
Not I, sir. I would be so.

601
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,359
But am not.

602
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,119
And who is it says so?

603
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,000
The world. Its law.

604
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,280
God's law.

605
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,240
Because you have children
and are unmarried?

606
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,640
Many reasons, sir.

607
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,120
Tell me, Lucy, what, what was it
brought you to Miss Susan yesterday?

608
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,759
Miss Susan sent me away.

609
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,319
I know, I know.

610
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,239
But, after two years
and with child inside you.

611
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,560
It is desperate of you.

612
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,080
Tell me, Lucy, please,
will you name that despair?

613
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,559
Lucy? Lucy?

614
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,278
The children
that your mother cared for,

615
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:38,040
the child that is inside you now.

616
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:40,919
Which man is father to them, Lucy?

617
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,919
It is but one man, is it not?

618
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,598
Do not be frighted, child.

619
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:47,160
It is in my gift to
guarantee your safety.

620
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,439
No, no I cannot!

621
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,680
No, I cannot, I cannot, no!
Calm. Calm. Calm, child!

622
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,720
There... sshh... all right.

623
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,280
Miss Eames' medication.
Mr Reid would know its contents.

624
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,798
Hobbs, Hobbs, Hobbs, slow down,
say again, say again. Yes sir.

625
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,758
Sir, Gordon Roach - that's
the murdered rent collector, sir -

626
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:08,240
has a company name of
Roach Collections. Imaginative.

627
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:11,399
Yes... No.

628
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,958
Roach Collections pays into and
receives stipend from a trust.
Name of?

629
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:18,958
Stickleton. The Stickleton Trust.
Its board members?

630
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:21,880
Not listed. The only name
that of a lawyer.

631
00:45:21,881 --> 00:45:23,519
A Mr Pinch.

632
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,759
Now, I visited Mr Pinch -
well, Mr Pinch's clerk, that is.

633
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,760
And impressed on him the value of
this... Yes, yes, Hobbs, skip to it.

634
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:35,880
Sir, the only trustee of the
Stickleton Trust is Mr Stanley Bone.

635
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,640
Sergeant Drake! With me!

636
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,520
Stanley Bone. Everything you have.

637
00:45:48,521 --> 00:45:49,640
Now.

638
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,480
Hang it.

639
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,758
Fred Best tells you
he needs something shown in return.

640
00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:29,638
You do as I ask, I will give to you
a story that, though you connive

641
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:32,680
and bribe your way to the devil
himself - it will not be bettered.

642
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:36,679
Go on. How Stanley Bone -
secret slumlord -

643
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,919
is exposed by the actions
of a whore-runner.

644
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,199
Corruption and sex, Mr Best.

645
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,880
Surely it does not come more
honeyed than that.

646
00:46:45,881 --> 00:46:47,799
Oh, yeah, Mama!

647
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,919
I have you now! Where's Reid?

648
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,079
He's out, he may be some time.

649
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,320
Well you're going to tell me.
Or I'm going to shoot Hobbs here.

650
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,078
Relax, Hobbs. Man, I'm only joking.

651
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,600
I could no more shoot you than
I could shoot my own mother.

652
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:08,080
Artherton, on the other hand...

653
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,999
As you know, Inspector,

654
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,358
he was one of the first raised
up in January by our new council.

655
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:16,958
Now in March he and his friends
agree that the Dockhead slum

656
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:20,718
in Southwark make way for the S&C
Railway and its very first tunnel.

657
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:24,238
The Dockhead was
also owned and collected by
the Stickleton Trust? It was.

658
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,240
Thus Mr Bone recommends the
compulsory purchase of his own slum.

659
00:47:27,241 --> 00:47:29,079
Mm-hm and profits tidily.

660
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,078
Mr Best, the last I saw you,
you made heavy weather of matters

661
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,880
that relate more closely to
Mr Bone's personal status.

662
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:38,079
I did. It is true.
Elaborate, if you please?

663
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,519
Mr Bone is a man who came to
ambition late.

664
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,680
His youth was not a happy one.
Beset with fits.

665
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,439
He is epileptic?

666
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,518
Was. He eventually found the cure.
And the cure? Where was it found?

667
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:53,520
You will let me pass,
or you will suck on this iron!

668
00:47:53,521 --> 00:47:55,920
Sir, stop! You can't go in there!

669
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,440
Drake.

670
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,240
Look, I swear I'm not going to shoot
you, only... tell Reid...

671
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,079
that the vial...
Lucy's medication... Uh...

672
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,079
What? What is it?

673
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,800
It is amphetamine!

674
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,398
The doctor who gave
Mr Bone his cure.

675
00:48:24,399 --> 00:48:27,158
His name is Crabbe, is it not?
It is, Mr Reid.

676
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:30,918
We go. Ah, one last question.
You jibed about his bachelor status.

677
00:48:30,919 --> 00:48:32,040
What did you mean by this?

678
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:35,199
That is the last piece of my puzzle,
Mr Reid.

679
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,038
There was tell
he had a woman cached away somewhere

680
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:39,478
and a set of bastards, too.

681
00:48:39,479 --> 00:48:40,560
And did you find them?

682
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:43,879
Never could, Mr Reid.
More's the pity, eh?

683
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,280
Indeed.

684
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,920
Your carriage is here.

685
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:03,880
A carriage that takes you to honour
the latest chapter of your ever more
celebrated life in this city.

686
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,480
Think on that.

687
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,120
Remember how you lived
the first you came to me -

688
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:18,839
cursed by fits and reliance
on your merciless wife.

689
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,160
Do you think I forget?
Am I not grateful for what you
have done for me?

690
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:27,679
I question your commitment
to all that still lies ahead of us.

691
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,239
Roach silenced the woman.

692
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,198
I have had the children separated
and removed a hundred mile
from here, as you suggested.

693
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:37,880
I do not refer to your unloved
bastards, as you well know.

694
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:45,639
It was your success had this
sanatorium built,

695
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,959
and she my gift to you in return.

696
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,680
A child, blooming into woman,
who would see in you

697
00:49:51,681 --> 00:49:55,799
not the stammering
lunatic of your youth,

698
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,480
but a vision of strength and hope.

699
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,320
You have enjoyed her.

700
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,519
But she is all used now.

701
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,800
And must have her mind
cleaned of all she knows of you.

702
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,719
But she is so young...

703
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,919
She too may find the temperance
you have led me toward.

704
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,159
No. She grows ever more disturbed.
And this Reid draws close.

705
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:33,359
I will not allow you to make ruins
of the life I have built for you.

706
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,959
She must be silenced
so put her from your mind,

707
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,640
as you have the memory of the man
you once were.

708
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:47,880
And leave me
to bring her a more permanent peace.

709
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,040
Karl, I would say goodbye.

710
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,200
Thank you, nurse.

711
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,080
Stanley?

712
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,560
Say what you need to say.

713
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,440
Goodbye, Lucy, goodbye, my love.

714
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,639
Stanley? Stanley,
where do they take me?

715
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:43,879
I... I've got another inside me,
Stanley, I got another. Stanley?

716
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,759
It's all right, Councillor Bone.

717
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,199
We cannot build a railway without
that we demolish a slum or two.

718
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,240
Sta...

719
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,799
Wait. That was Bone!

720
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,480
It can wait. We keep our course.

721
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:26,520
Hush, Lucy. Shh, imagine it.

722
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:37,800
A calm entire. Hmm, no questions,
no hurtful thoughts.

723
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,400
No urgent and unhappy desires.

724
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,600
Simply peace.

725
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,519
You found us.

726
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,558
It was not easy.
You've hidden this refuge well.

727
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:22,360
But that is a benefit
to those you house.

728
00:53:22,361 --> 00:53:24,160
It is. Miss Goren?

729
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,400
Inspector.

730
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,280
Nicholas? Betsy? Hello!

731
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,280
Come here, you!

732
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,680
Come on, let's go inside, shall we?
And show you the room
Mrs Reid has got for us.

733
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:45,919
Yeah? Come on.

734
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,920
Will you take tea, Miss Goren.

735
00:53:47,921 --> 00:53:49,400
Yes, thank you.

736
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,599
Gentlemen! Ladies! The switch is
thrown. The line is live.

737
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,160
And beneath this earth here,
the electric age forges on.

738
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,638
This railway, this
underground railway is
the capstone of all that we -

739
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:21,278
your grateful servants -
would build here.

740
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:24,198
The foundation, ladies
and gentlemen, of a new city.

741
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:27,798
A city that - though it
rises from dank and fetid earth -

742
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:31,478
will gleam with the purpose
and clarity of a summer morning.

743
00:54:31,479 --> 00:54:34,880
Because if the future stands
for anything - it stands for hope!

744
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,640
You do not have to do this thing.

745
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,360
I do, Inspector.

746
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,880
H Division's Inspector Reid!
What intrusion is this?

747
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,200
Yes, Stanley. I still have my wits.

748
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,078
Miss, Miss. What is your name?

749
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,680
Her name is not relevant.
Her story is.

750
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,960
I know you, Stanley Bone.

751
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:36,999
You proclaim to these good people
about the future's gleaming hope,

752
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,359
but the tongue you
speak with is forked.

753
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,280
And the future you speak of,
it is built on evil and corruption.

754
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,479
You had me as your slave,
denied our children...

755
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,760
had my mother murdered and you would
have sent me to a living hell had it
not been for this inspector here.

756
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,999
You are no man, but you are
a beast that has risen

757
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,240
deep from the earth in
which you dig into.

758
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,480
Mr Stanley Bone!

759
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,960
You halt for the police!

760
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,040
Watch yourself, off the track.
Turn it off, somebody!

761
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,160
Christ alive!

762
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:11,759
You're famous. From a Leman Street
cell to the front page in a day.

763
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,239
Someone must be fond of you.

764
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,919
Hmm, such fame is impermanent.

765
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,120
You'd better hope so.
Otherwise, it's going to be you and
me lacking in permanence.

766
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,400
Whoever we contend with here,
they are no ordinary cracksmen.

767
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,559
Again!

768
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,400
All men stand equal before the law,
do they not? That is the law.

769
00:57:46,401 --> 00:57:48,560
It is your law. Is it yours?

770
00:57:54,217 --> 00:57:59,787
