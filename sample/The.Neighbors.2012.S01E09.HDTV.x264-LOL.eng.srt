00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:07,818
Merry crap-mas, everyone.

2
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:09,637
This sucks.
(sighs)

3
00:00:09,657 --> 00:00:11,390
Okay, guys.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,961
I know christmas didn't
go exactly how we planned.

5
00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:17,182
We don't have any presents
under the tree.

6
00:00:17,202 --> 00:00:19,182
- We don't have a tree.
- But santa...

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,267
Santa called. He's not gonna
be able to make it this year.

8
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:24,596
But here's the thing...
we have each other.

9
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:27,761
We got through another year together,
and that's what really matters.

10
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:30,388
- Yay, none of us died.
- (angrily) Merry christmas.

11
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:32,358
So this is what we're
gonna do, okay?

12
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:35,772
We're gonna go downstairs,
and we are gonna make the best of this.

13
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,584
All right? Let's go.

14
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,870
Come on.

15
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:49,852
♪ We wish you
a merry christmas ♪

16
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:51,476
♪ We wish you
a merry christmas ♪

17
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:54,995
God bless us, every one!
Aah!

18
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:57,337
Ow!

21
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:05,776
Did you get Max's Ipad?
I think we forgot the Ipad.

22
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:07,849
We didn't forget it.
It's right there.

23
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,278
It's the blue wrapping paper.
Are you sure that's the Ipad?

24
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:11,256
Honey, you tend to remember
something you bought your 8-year-old

25
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:13,163
that you're gonna be paying for
for the next three years.

26
00:01:13,183 --> 00:01:16,799
Okay, I got Amber's snowboard,
and our list is officially complete.

27
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,772
(groans)
The rest is up to Santa.

28
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:20,807
Ho! (grunts)
(grunts)

29
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,491
(knocks on door)

30
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:24,910
Hello!
Hey, guys!

31
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:26,275
What's with the apron?
You cooking something?

32
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,782
No. I just like what it does
for my silhouette.

33
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:30,633
He loves the apron.

34
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,492
So, guys, we need
a small favor.

35
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:34,308
We need a place to hide
our christmas gifts.

36
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,206
We got some nosy kids,
and...

37
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,961
Christmas! I've been
so excited for this one!

38
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:40,649
Oh, you people.

39
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:43,292
So, we're not excited
about this one, either?

40
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,315
- Here we go.
- You mean the orgy of commercialism

41
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:47,388
I've been hearing about
since March? No.

42
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:50,269
I just don't see how two
relatively sane human beings

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,290
can participate in such
an insane holiday.

44
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,936
Oh, it's not insane, Larry.
It's fun for us,

45
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:56,462
and for the kids, and Abby's 6,

46
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,845
and she still gets caught up
in the magic of it all.

47
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:02,022
Ah, there it is. Abby.
It's always about "Abby."

48
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,231
Don't put my daughter
in quotations, Larry.

49
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:07,432
What's so special about that little girl?
Nothing, as far as I can see.

50
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:09,505
Yet you two have concocted
yet another excuse

51
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:12,446
to lavish both her and the more
worthwhile Weaver children

52
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,382
with disposable
commercial crap.

53
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:18,089
- Larry, you've got it all wrong.
- Okay, christmas is about family

54
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:21,370
and smiles and the joy
of being together.

55
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,713
The gifts are just
one tiny part of it.

56
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:26,592
Oh, yes. And there's that
fat, slovenly burglar

57
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:28,670
you call Santa Claus. Honestly.

58
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,940
Put on an apron
for god's sake, fatso.

59
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,301
He's struggling
with Santa Claus.

60
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:34,538
Of course you can keep
your presents here.

61
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:36,287
- All right, get around back.
- Ready, babe?

62
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:37,471
- 1... 2...
- Watch the top.

63
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,833
- Wheel your barrow your full of crap...
- I'm okay.

64
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:40,970
- (Marty) The door. The door.
- Oh! Oh!

65
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:42,605
(shouting indistinctly)
Man down. Man down.

66
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,635
All right.
Yeah, we got it.

67
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,109
(shouting indistinctly) Just
watch the floors. They're bamboo.

68
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:49,712
I got it. Yes.
Okay.

69
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:53,349
(man) ♪ Deck the halls

70
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:55,213

72
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:58,237
What's wrong?
(clicks tongue)

73
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:02,737
Do you think Larry's right,
and we're too caught up in the presents?

74
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:05,244
No, babe. Larry's just
being Larry, okay?

75
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:07,611
Our kids understand
the meaning of christmas.

76
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,827
They don't even need
presents.

77
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:13,207
Hey, mom, make sure my snowboard has
step-in bindings and not those lame straps.

78
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,019
(singsongy) We'll see
what Santa brings.

79
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,446
Yeah, uh, don't even worry
about wrapping it.

80
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:18,207
It's just gonna slow me down.

81
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:20,193
Also, Jeremy called,
and it turns out

82
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:22,129
we're going on the ski trip
the day before christmas

83
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:25,032
instead of the day after,
so I'm gonna need my presents early.

84
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:26,321
Hold up, Amber.

85
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:29,090
- This family celebrates christmas together.
- Yeah.

86
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,106
Yeah. I'll text you
from the mountain.

87
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,476
What...

88
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:33,802
Well, I'll be here.

89
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,740
And I want some new games
for the Xbox.

90
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,961
Wait. I thought you wanted
an Ipad.

91
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:40,860
I'll multitask. Oh,
and I also want a new bike.

92
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,618
A new bike.
What about you, huh?

93
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:44,360
You have any changes
you'd like to make?

94
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,525
Nah. Santa knows what I want.
He'll take care of me.

95
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:49,287
Oh, and, uh,
here's my new list.

96
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:50,776
I've highlighted the changes.

97
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:52,638
Be sure to look at page 3.

98
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:53,982
Page 3.

99
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,939
You should probably fax it.
It's getting pretty late.

100
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:59,309
Okay, I'll get on that.
Thank you.

101
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:02,801
God! What the hell?
Is this the constitution?

102
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:05,283
Who makes amendments
to a christmas list?

103
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:07,045
You know what? You're right.

104
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:09,931
It's become all about this stuff.
Our kids are completely out of control.

105
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:11,606
I hated all three of them
just now, Marty.

106
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,262
In that moment, I hated
all three of our children.

107
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:15,527
You know what?

108
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,325
Maybe we should try something
different this year.

109
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:18,713
Forget the presents.

110
00:04:18,747 --> 00:04:20,431
Let's take a nice
vacation somewhere

111
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:23,002
and hang with the family
for christmas.

112
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:24,863
Somewhere nice.
Maybe somewhere tropical.

113
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:26,104
Yeah, but we can't afford
tropical.

114
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:28,272
We just spent a buttload
of money on all their presents.

115
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:31,581
No! We return the presents
and we use the money for the trip!

116
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,067
- Can we do that?
- We're the parents.

117
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:36,884
We named those
greedy little monsters.

118
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:39,926
- We can do whatever we want!
- Oh, my god!

119
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,643
We could have christmas tans.
(squeals)

120
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:45,846
I'm gonna be brown
for the super bowl!

121
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,748
(Larry Bird) Look at this
bloated pile of consumerism.

122
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:50,935
And most of it for that
little girl.

123
00:04:51,143 --> 00:04:53,278
What's her deal?
Is she really that cute?

124
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,306
She is pretty cute,
husband.

125
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,441
Dad, she's pretty much
the cutest kid ever.

126
00:04:57,476 --> 00:05:00,520
And her teeth keep on
falling out of her face.

127
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,380
What's gonna fall off
next, her nose?

128
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:05,933
Oh, father! I love it
when you make fun of children.

129
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:08,372
The whole thing is ridiculous.
I mean,

130
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,134
what could possibly be
this shape,

131
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:12,413
and yet be so exciting
to receive?

132
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:16,190
No, really. It's not
a rhetorical question.

133
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,343
- What do you think it is?
- It looks like a giant board,

134
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:21,012
perhaps for some sort
of, um, winter sport.

135
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:22,645
Don't be a dolt, Reggie.

136
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:25,330
(Abby) What's the surprise?

137
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,378
(Debbie) Well, your dad
and I were talking,

138
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:30,208
And we decided to do christmas
a little different this year.

139
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:31,511
Presents early?
No.

140
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:35,184
Can we do jewish christmas
and get presents for eight days?

141
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:39,833
What? No. We decided
that instead of presents this year...

142
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,023
We're going
on a family trip!

143
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:48,826
(laughing)

144
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:50,362
(laughing)

145
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:51,680
We're not joking.

146
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:53,315
(laughing stops)

147
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:55,428
They're not joking!

148
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:57,563
You're not joking?

149
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,022
What kind of sick game
are you playing?

150
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,924
We're just children!

151
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,918
(men harmonizing)
♪ Merry christmas

152
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:10,242
Perhaps it's a galapagos
turtle with a flattened shell.

153
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:11,768
A giant stick of gum?

154
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,735
Okay, one more time, why are we so quick
to dismiss snowboard?

155
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:17,569
(paper rips)

156
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:20,042

158
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:25,282
Oh, that felt
really, really good.

159
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:26,932
Oh.

It's beautiful.

163
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:36,703
- What is it, husband?
- It's a... it's... it's...

164
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:39,113
- It's a thing.
- (Jackie Joyner-Kersee) Oh.

165
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,659
- And it's glorious.
- Okay, was that as fun as it looked?

166
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,091
Even better.

167
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:45,712
- (gasps) I want one!
- Me, too!

168
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:48,354
- Yes! Presents for everyone!
- Oh!

about that, sweetie,

197

with Santa this morning, and guess what?

- He approved our trip!
- You know what? That's interesting,

199
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:19,975
Because I was skype-ing with Santa
after you finished texting with him,

200
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:23,189

a ski trip with my friends.
