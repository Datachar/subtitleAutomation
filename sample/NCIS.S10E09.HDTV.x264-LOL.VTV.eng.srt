180
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:32,769
might have simply
been a coincidence.

181
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:34,050
No way. And enough

182
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:35,801
with the girl power.
More likely

183
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,419
she finally hired
that hit man

184
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:40,455
she's been talking about
for years, to take me out.

185
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,959
(laughs):
No!

186
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:45,627
No.

187
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:49,231
But we should put
a pin in that.

188
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:51,233
Seaman Brown-- what
do we know about him?

189
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:53,686
Background confirms what
the annoying drunk guy told you.

190
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:55,187
Brown wasn't exactly model Navy.

191
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:57,239
He was reprimanded several times
for fighting with his shipmates

192
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:58,357
and for being
late for duty.

193
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,858
TONY:
He was actually in the process

194
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,110
of getting
a bad-conduct discharge.

195
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:02,778
But we didn't find a
thing in his background

196
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,113
that connects him
to Agent Fornell.

197
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:06,315
Other than the fact
that my ex-wife showed up

198
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:07,700
at his workplace today.

199
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,484
No putting it off
any longer.

200
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:11,486
Interrogation time.

201
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:13,122
I can't wait to see this.

202
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:14,173
Don't worry about it.

203
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:16,926
You're gonna have
a front-row seat.

204
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:19,345
How dare you!

205
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:21,663
Questioning me like
some common criminal!

206
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:23,432
(groans) Who do you
think you are?

207
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:24,800
When I get
through with you,

208
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:26,168
Agent Coif...

209
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,219
you're gonna be wishing

210
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:29,054
your parents hadn't
even been born.

211
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:30,406
Coif?
And you two!

212
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:31,774
(scoffs)

213
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:34,476
What, are you too afraid to come
in here and face me yourselves?

214
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:36,228
I won't dignify that
with a response!

215
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,646
You just did.

216
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:39,448
TONY: Okay, I don't want
to be here, either.

217
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,566
Will you please sit down!

218
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:43,185
(whispers): Will you
please just sit down?

219
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:47,990
(sighs)

220
00:08:47,992 --> 00:08:50,209
(low grunt)

221
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:51,877
DIANE:
I have already told you,

222
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,796
I don't know
Seaman Brown.

223
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:55,080
She's lying--
her lip curled.

224
00:08:55,082 --> 00:08:56,966
I saw it.
TONY: You also told

225
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:59,485
Agent Gibbs and Fornell you
were at the bar for a tax audit,

226
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:01,036
but you told the bar manager

227
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:02,972
you were interested
in buying the place.

228
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,974
It is a woman's prerogative
to change her mind.

229
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,376
Is it a woman's prerogative
to carry two fake I.D.'s?

230
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:09,144
You went through my purse?

231
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:10,980
No.

232
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:12,147
McGee did.

233
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,899
Now, uh...

234
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,768
does your husband
know that your...

235
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,187
walking around town
posing as Mrs. Fornell?

236
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:19,822
Victor is in Turks and Caicos

237
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:21,586
at a destination wedding
with my daughter.

238
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:22,525
What's the matter,

239
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:24,610
you didn't get invited?
Yes, I was invited.

240
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:26,728
I just needed a little...

241
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,747
time to myself.
Stop it!

242
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:29,748
You two!

243
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,783
I can hear you smirking

244
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:32,868
from in here.
Listen, you tell Agent...

245
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,370
uh, McGee

246
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,505
that when I catch
your frickin' scrawny ass...

247
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:39,074
Gibbs, the interrogation
is ov...

248
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:45,347
Right. Should've
seen that one coming.

249
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:48,967
Gibbs...
the interrogation is over.

250
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:51,253
Why?

251
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:53,722
DIANE:
Well, it took you long enough!

252
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:58,593
I'll bet she's a panther
in the sack.

253
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:01,363
Yes, sir.

254
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:02,448
I understand, sir.

255
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,532
Thank <i>you,</i> sir.

256
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:05,367
Idiot.

257
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:06,368
Satisfied?

258
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,536
I'm satisfied
I'm cleared to talk.

259
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:08,537
I am unsatisfied

260
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:10,122
that now I have
to talk to <i>them.</i>

261
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:11,457
"Cleared"?
Mrs. Sterling

262
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,158
was telling you the truth,
as least partly.

263
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,793
She did go
back to work

264
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:16,962
for the IRS,
just not as an auditor.

265
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,965
She's been promoted
to a GS-11 position

266
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,050
in Enforcement.

267
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:22,584
Which means...

268
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:26,422
It means that you two aren't
the only ones with a badge.

269
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:29,508
Wow.

270
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,144
My breakfast burrito
is about to say "hello."

271
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:34,430
The IRS Deputy Commissioner
called when he heard

272
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,631
that we had...
one of their agents.

273
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:38,467
Agents?
Wow.

274
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:39,852
"And the Lord wept."
DIANE: Yes, agent.

275
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:43,272
And I was undercover when
you two bumbled into the bar.

276
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:44,440
Undercover on what?

277
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:46,408
Big tax-fraud case.

278
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,860
Somebody's stealing
identities,

279
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:49,328
filing fake returns
and making off

280
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,163
with a boatload
in fraudulent refund checks.

281
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:53,365
Costs the IRS
billions each year.

282
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,451
We have traced several
identity thefts to the bar.

283
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:57,586
My plan <i>was</i>
to I.D. the thief

284
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:59,254
and follow him back
to the ringleader.

285
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:01,623
I was posing as a buyer
so I could interview

286
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,925
the employees on the DL.

287
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,543
You were posing as Mrs. Fornell.

288
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:06,261
Budget cuts.

289
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:07,546
A fake I.D.
is expensive.

290
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:09,214
I was improvising.
Improvising?!

291
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:11,333
Your improvising
almost got me killed!

292
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:14,503
You must have ruffled
the wrong feathers, Agent <i>Fornell.</i>

293
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:15,687
And those feathers
thought I was

294
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:17,301
part of your op
and put a hit out on me!

295
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:19,175
Sorry?

296
00:11:19,176 --> 00:11:21,477
Sorry?!
VANCE: All right, calm down.

297
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:24,029
If there was a hit put out on you,
it means Agent Sterling

298
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,232
is getting close, which also
means she's in danger, too.

299
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:29,109
I want to see your files.
(laughs): No way!

300
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:29,817
It wasn't a request.

301
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:31,571
Oh, I'm so sorry,
let me rephrase that. Go...

302
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:33,622
VANCE:
I said calm down.

303
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:35,073
Everyone.

304
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:36,959
You'll have plenty of time
to review her files.

305
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:39,962
Since this case now spans
three federal agencies,

306
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:42,114
your bosses and
I have decided

307
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:45,467
that the three of you will be
working on this case together.

308
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:00,739
(whispers):
Here she comes.

309
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:03,192
Here I go.
Gibbs told us to stay put.

310
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:04,860
FORNELL: Better you should run
for the hills.

311
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:07,129
You know, I am not any happier
about this than you are,

312
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:08,997
so can we please make it
as painless as possible.

313
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,916
So says the Queen of Pain.

314
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:13,886
What is going on?
New assignment.

315
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:15,521
Special Agent... Sterling

316
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:17,122
will you bring
you up to speed.

317
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:19,958
TONY (laughing):
What...

318
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,211
Oh, that's-that's...
very cool.

319
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,848
DIANE: Chucky, would you
pull up the IRS mainframe,

320
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,219
directory: dsterling;
password: Tobias cheap.

321
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:34,473
As I told Frick and Frack already,
somebody is running

322
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:37,092
a major fraud operation
against the IRS,

323
00:12:37,094 --> 00:12:38,310
stealing hundreds of identities,

324
00:12:38,312 --> 00:12:40,395
submitting thousands
in fake tax returns.

325
00:12:40,397 --> 00:12:41,930
DIANE: We've traced
the identity thefts...

326
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:43,866
To the Navy bar where Gibbs
and Fornell bumped into you?

327
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:46,101
And you think someone there was
lifting driver's license info.

328
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:47,286
McGEE:
Probably Seaman Brown.

329
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,654
As a bouncer,
he would've checked

330
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:51,206
every I.D. that
came through the door.

331
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,075
You must be very proud, Jethro.

332
00:12:53,993 --> 00:12:55,761
Clearly Brown
is not the mastermind behind

333
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:57,796
this operation-- he doesn't
have the accounting chops.

334
00:12:57,798 --> 00:12:59,748
We're looking for somebody else.
Did you run down

335
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,166
the addresses of
the fake tax returns?

336
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:03,051
Yeah, all P.O. boxes,
all dead ends.

337
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:04,803
They keep rotating them out
for new ones.

338
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:06,638
Where are the perps
cashing the refund checks?

339
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,291
Well, various storefronts
on the opposite side of town.

340
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:10,976
I've already run down
a whole bunch,

341
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:12,344
but I got a bunch more.

342
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:13,645
You thinking what I'm thinking?
GIBBS: Yeah.

343
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:16,014
Gibbs and I are gonna
double-check the P.O. boxes,

344
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:17,482
just in case you
missed something.

345
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:20,652
And me?
GIBBS: Check-cashing outlets.

346
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:23,238
Opposite side of town.

347
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:26,942
I'll be with you
in a minute.

348
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:29,477
This is not even close to
the "opposite side of town."

349
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:32,998
No, but I knew if I said that,
the boys would want to split up.

350
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,585
I'm not taking a break from my
husband just to spend it with my exes.

351
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:38,003
A break?

352
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:40,038
Are you and Victor
having difficulties?

353
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,875
(sighing):
Victor, no.

354
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:44,760
Me, yes.

355
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:46,628
I...
Did not mean to intrude.

356
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,496
Now, don't get me
wrong-- Victor,

357
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:51,800
he's a good man and he's...
he's a great role model for Emily,

358
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:53,602
but I just...

359
00:13:53,604 --> 00:13:55,187
I don't know.

360
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:58,557
I'm starting to wonder if I made
a mistake getting married again.

361
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,010
How so?
Well, I...

362
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:05,864
I settled down so... early, and
I just went from marriage to marriage,

363
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:07,719
you know, and I never
went out and acted crazy,

364
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:09,452
like all my friends.

365
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:11,536
Mm. And now you wish to...

366
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:13,121
act... crazy?

367
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:15,324
Yeah.

368
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:18,360
I want to go out and
do something wild.

369
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:20,862
Just let loose for once.

370
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:22,047
Huh.

371
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:23,999
That's hard to do
if you're married.

372
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:26,368
To Victor.

373
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,886
MAN: Look, guy,
I'm gonna need

374
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:30,005
some kind of I.D., okay?

375
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:31,556
Next.

376
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:34,009
Or working for the IRS.
Hm.

377
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:37,396
Agent Sterling, IRS,

378
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:38,847
Criminal Investigations
Division.

379
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:40,482
Agent David, NCIS.

380
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:42,150
I'm not getting
a check-cashing vibe.

381
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:43,268
We're gonna need
some information.

382
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,319
ZIVA: These are
fraudulently

383
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:45,604
obtained IRS refund checks.

384
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:47,940
They were cashed here--
we need to know by whom.

385
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:50,742
Fraudulently obtained?
Hey, that's not my fault.

386
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:52,110
Well, as the owner,
it's your responsibility

387
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:54,079
to help us find out
whose fault it is.

388
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:56,281
All right. If it's
one thing I'm good at,

389
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:57,899
is throwing people
under the bus.

390
00:14:57,901 --> 00:14:59,668
Uh...

391
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,237
yeah, I recognize
the billing code.

392
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:03,789
Oliver Lambert.

393
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,757
An accountant who
comes here once a week,

394
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,509
cashes checks for his clients.

395
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,011
Do you have his contact info?
Yeah.

396
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:10,512
I have his contact info,

397
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:12,414
records of transactions,

398
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,633
I've even got the guy's
<i>shayna punim</i>

399
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:16,218
on video, if you'd like.

400
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,971
Just give me a sec.

401
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:23,025
ABBY: Just like the man said--
once a week, like clockwork,

402
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:26,028
Lambert cashes about a dozen
refund checks and then splits.

403
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,863
Looks like we've
got our mastermind.

404
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:29,564
An accountant should
certainly have the chops

405
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:31,366
to scam the IRS.

406
00:15:31,368 --> 00:15:33,201
He and Seaman Brown must've
been working together.

407
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:34,736
No word on Lambert's BOLO, boss.

408
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:36,538
He wasn't at his
home or office,

409
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,957
and his cell phone is off,
but we did get his computer.

410
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,993
ABBY: Have you checked race tracks?
'Cause I notice

411
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:44,046
every single time Lambert
shows up, he has the same

412
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:45,964
piece of paper folded up
in his back pocket.

413
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:47,082
It's a betting sheet.

414
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:49,784
He likes the horses.
I'll expand the BOLO,

415
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:52,337
but I don't think he's hanging around--
he just emptied his bank account.

416
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:53,006
Nah, he's running.

417
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:54,924
Must have found out
the Feds are after him.

418
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:56,491
I'm guessing
he already knew.

419
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:59,144
He's probably the one who tried
to have you killed, remember?

420
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:03,015
Speaking of which, Diane is
probably on his hit list, too.

421
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:04,933
It's getting late.
With Lambert on the loose,

422
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:06,234
she should probably...

423
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:08,487
sleep at your house tonight.
I'll talk to you later.

424
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,489
No, you're right,
she shouldn't be alone,

425
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,973
but since you
married her last,

426
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:13,191
I think that
means your place.

427
00:16:13,193 --> 00:16:14,609
ABBY:
This is gonna be good.

428
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:16,461
FORNELL:
I've got no clean sheets.

429
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:19,314
My heater's broken.
I've got toxic black mold in my kitchen.

430
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:20,832
I'll let these two
figure it out,

431
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,418
since I know the one place
she's definitely <i>not</i> staying.

432
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:34,713
(sighs)

433
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:36,431
Oh, this is
ridiculous.

434
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,383
Why can't I just
stay at my place?

435
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:40,268
They can post an agent
outside my door.

436
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,188
'Cause the best way to protect you is
to make you hard to find.

437
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,523
Well, then trust me,
we're good,

438
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:46,025
because no one's
gonna come looking for me

439
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:47,442
this close to
where you shower.

440
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:49,778
Look, I'll take the couch;
you can have the bed.

441
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,863
I would rather stand;
I'll take the couch.

442
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:53,198
Whatever.

443
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,351
(sighs) You don't have to be
so rude about it.

444
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:59,321
Me? Being rude?

445
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:00,989
This coming from the woman
who spent

446
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:03,208
the entire car ride over here
telling me I had

447
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,859
the worst possible haircut
for my face.

448
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:06,861
I was trying to be helpful.
Oh, were you also being helpful

449
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:08,696
when you told me my elbows
weren't pointy enough?

450
00:17:08,698 --> 00:17:09,798
What does that even mean?

451
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,249
Cut me slack, Chucky.

452
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:13,468
(groans) I almost had
my daughter's father killed,

453
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,204
my husband wants to leave me,
and now I find out

454
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:17,872
my own life might be in danger?

455
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:20,892
The rumor I heard was, you
were thinking of leaving Victor.

456
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:24,179
It's none of your business;
I don't want to talk about it.

457
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:25,666
Trust me, fine by me.

458
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:27,984
Oh, the thing is that Victor,
he used to tell me

459
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:30,352
every day I was the most
beautiful woman in the world,

460
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:33,989
and now he...
doesn't say that anymore.

461
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:36,274
So has <i>he</i> changed...

462
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:39,161
or have I?

463
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:41,363
What do you think?

464
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:44,249
Excuse me?

465
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:47,068
Well, it's a simple question.

466
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,488
You're an attractive man--
I-I want to know,

467
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,407
do you find me attractive?

468
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:55,093
Um...

469
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:56,845
you mean physically, or...?
I mean, when it

470
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:59,264
came to Jethro, you know,
who could blame me for that?

471
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,882
And he was still in love
with his dead wife,

472
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:03,718
and I was just another
in a string of failed marriages,

473
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,520
but then Tobias and...

474
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:07,606
and now maybe Victor...

475
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:11,026
You're worried something
might be wrong with you?

476
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:13,328
Yeah.

477
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:20,902
Look, you're... attractive.

478
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:24,406
At least on the outside.

479
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:26,658
(scoffs quietly)

480
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,577
I'll take it.

481
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,045
(relieved sigh)
I'm sorry.

482
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,080
I didn't mean to unload
on you like that.

483
00:18:32,082 --> 00:18:33,965
(sighs):
I just... you know,

484
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:36,751
I guess I...
what I really need...

485
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:38,453
To be alone?
No.

486
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:40,305
Yeah, well,

487
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:42,224
believe it or not, I...

488
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:44,342
I think I just need a hug.

489
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:50,932
I'm not hugging you.

490
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:53,435
Why not?
Uh, it's not gonna happen.

491
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:55,158
You come over here and hug me
right now, damn it!

492
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:55,938
No way.

493
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,522
What kind of man are you?

494
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:59,407
Here you have
a depressed,

495
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:01,643
miserable coworker
standing right in front of you,

496
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:03,912
you can't even give her
a simple hug?

497
00:19:05,114 --> 00:19:06,698
(sighs)

498
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,868
Your parents failed.

499
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:20,095
(quiet sigh)

500
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:32,774
(sobs)

501
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:36,811
(Diane sobbing quietly)

502
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,201
(birds chirping)

503
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:50,064
(horn honking in distance)

504
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,644
(door opens)

505
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:53,715
FORNELL: Hey, Gibbs,
what's taking so long?

506
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:55,497
Come on, people!

507
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:58,133
Chop, chop!

508
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:00,868
Holy Fourth of July
weenie roast!

509
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,203
What the hell am I looking at?!

510
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:05,724
(moaning softly)

511
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:07,559
Mm?

512
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:10,211
Whoa! Boss, this is
not what it looks like.

513
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:12,314
What does it look like?
DIANE: W-We were talking

514
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:14,432
and, you know,
we fell asleep on the couch.

515
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:16,268
Intertwined like
horny rabbits!

516
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,886
What's it to you?
So what if something happened?

517
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:21,273
No, no, nothing happened.
<i>We're</i> not married anymore.

518
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:23,057
No, but <i>you</i> are!
Why are you...

519
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:25,160
GIBBS:
Enough! We need to all

520
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:27,195
put a pin in it.

521
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:31,032
Abby's got a lead
on an accountant.

522
00:20:42,878 --> 00:20:46,047
Hey, boss. Abby found an e-mail
on the accountant's PC

523
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:49,083
about an overdue payment
on this rental house.

524
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:50,719
That's the search warrant.

525
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:52,103
Where's Agent Sterling?

526
00:20:52,105 --> 00:20:55,807
We thought it was best for the op for
her to take a shower.

527
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:58,276
I mean head back to
NCIS to assist Abby.

528
00:20:58,278 --> 00:20:59,644
I told you,
nothing happened.

529
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:01,980
Rental house?
Yeah, Lambert went out of his way

530
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:03,865
to hide his connection
to the place.

531
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,450
FORNELL:So, let's see
what's inside.

532
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:06,618
McGee...

533
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,903
you and I
take the back.

534
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:11,706
No. I'll go with you.

535
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:15,243
What was that all about?

536
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:17,746
I don't want to talk about it.
Come on, spill it.

537
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:19,497
(knocking)

538
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:22,634
NCIS! Open up, we got
a search warrant!

539
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:24,502
And an agent
keeping secrets!

540
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:26,621
Shut up and open it, Tony.
Relax, McGee.

541
00:21:40,186 --> 00:21:42,687
(low groan)

542
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:46,107
Whew! It's colder in here
than it is outside.

543
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:56,785
Fishy.
(chuckles)

544
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:03,925
Right. Of course.

545
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,261
The accountant
was renting a home

546
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:07,846
for his frozen fish collection.

547
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,501
There's nobody home.

548
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:16,304
Nobody living,
at least.

549
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:24,129
FORNELL:
Is that the drunk guy

550
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:26,347
from the bar?

551
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,025
Okay... if you don't
tell me what happened

552
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:41,788
between you and Diane,

553
00:22:41,813 --> 00:22:43,299
then I'm just gonna have
to believe the rumors.

554
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,964
Tony, how many times do I have
to tell you? Nothing happened.

555
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,633
Wait. What rumors?
The kind

556
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,384
that would make
a grown man blush, McGee.

557
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:52,703
Even our latest victim
turned a slight shade of pink

558
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,754
when he heard one.

559
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:55,205
And he's <i>dead.</i>
Oh, please

560
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,058
don't tell me everyone here
is talking about this.

561
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,876
We're working an IRS fraud case.

562
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,062
You sleeping <i>alone</i>
is more interesting.

563
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:02,914
Much less you sleeping with...
I didn't.

564
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,066
<i>We</i> didn't.
Look, we found

565
00:23:05,068 --> 00:23:06,851
a house filled with nothing
but frozen fish.

566
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,402
That's not more
interesting to you?

567
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,988
No.
Diane and I

568
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,676
feel asleep on the couch,
talking, that's all.

569
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:15,428
Well, given Agent Gibb's and
Fornell's propensity for violence,

570
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:18,484
that's the story I would
stick to if I were you.

571
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:20,703
DUCKY:
All right, much as I find

572
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:23,706
your sexual escapades riveting,

573
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,875
the story that I'm
really interested in

574
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:27,626
belongs to
this man.

575
00:23:27,628 --> 00:23:30,463
Go ahead, McCasanova,
change the subject.

576
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:33,049
His name is Viggo Kiln.

577
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:35,601
From what we can tell from the
files found at his home, he was

578
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:37,053
working with Seaman Brown
and the accountant.

579
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:39,171
TONY: Viggo provided
the assist, playing

580
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:40,973
the lovable barfly
chatting people up,

581
00:23:40,975 --> 00:23:42,558
getting the details
about their lives

582
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,477
so that they could steal
their identities.

583
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:46,362
Once the accountant
had enough info,

584
00:23:46,364 --> 00:23:48,981
he'd file a fake return,
then collect the refund check.

585
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:51,150
Yeah, well, it seems
our barfly's services

586
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:52,684
are no longer required.

587
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:55,687
We extracted two bullets
from his brain cavity.

588
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:57,406
Execution style.

589
00:23:57,408 --> 00:24:00,709
Abby ran ballistics--
two .22-caliber low-loads.

590
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:02,328
She also
matched them

591
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,863
to a gun registered
to an Oliver Lambert.

592
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:07,333
The missing accountant.

593
00:24:07,335 --> 00:24:08,918
Well, maybe the two
had a falling-out.

594
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,869
Maybe Lambert knew
we were on to him,

595
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:12,588
was looking to
tie up loose ends?

596
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,592
Well, neither of which explains
the presence of the frozen fish.

597
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:19,979
Do you have a theory
as to its significance?

598
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:22,331
DIANE: <i>I think we have</i>
<i>a good working theory</i>

599
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,233
on the fish-- I just want
to dig a little deeper

600
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:26,218
before we take it to the boys,
just in case we're wrong.

601
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,853
I think we have enough
to go to Gibbs.

602
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:29,522
Yeah, Gibbs maybe, but Fornell?

603
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:30,573
The man takes
too much pleasure

604
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:31,774
in proving me wrong.
The last thing

605
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:33,526
I want to do
is make <i>him</i> happy.

606
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:36,562
So...

607
00:24:36,564 --> 00:24:39,115
do anything, um...

608
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:41,250
crazy lately?

609
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:42,568
Huh? What do you mean?

610
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,087
Well, you told me yesterday
you wanted to go out

611
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:47,873
and do something crazy,
so I was just wondering if...

612
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,208
you did.

613
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,793
DIANE:
Nailed it! I found a clue.

614
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:53,212
This is a shipping manifest
for a place called

615
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:54,547
Donggang in China.

616
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:56,098
You pull it up?

617
00:24:58,051 --> 00:24:59,885
And 's right
on the border with...

618
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:01,920
North Korea-- that is
the third in a row.

619
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:03,355
Too many to be
a coincidence.

620
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:04,523
FORNELL:
And nobody likes those,

621
00:25:04,525 --> 00:25:06,758
especially when
they involve North Korea

622
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,776
or couches.

623
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:09,145
GIBBS:
What do we got?

624
00:25:09,147 --> 00:25:10,696
We were going over
the shipping manifests

625
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:13,265
we found in the fish house,
and we noticed a pattern.

626
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:16,318
All of the fish are being exported
to small fishing villages,

627
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,487
all on the borders of some
very interesting countries.

628
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:21,707
FORNELL:
Syria, North Korea and Iran.

629
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:23,442
The Axis of Evil 2.0.

630
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:25,010
Well, that
doesn't look good.

631
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:27,480
And what's with sending
fish to fishing villages?

632
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:29,114
Doesn't it usually work
the other way around?

633
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:30,149
Well, we're not sure
what that means.

634
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:32,117
I know a customs agent
I could talk to,

635
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,303
see if he'll issue a BOLO
on similar shipments.

636
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:35,504
That might
shed some light.

637
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:36,672
Tobias, go back to the FBI,

638
00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:38,891
do the same thing.
Jethro, MTAC.

639
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:40,426
See if there's
any new intel on Syria,

640
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:43,229
North Korea or Iran.

641
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,350
Did she just give us orders?

642
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:49,435
Yeah.

643
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:51,403
But they're good ones.

644
00:25:51,405 --> 00:25:52,988
I know!

645
00:26:00,163 --> 00:26:01,947
Where'd everybody go?

646
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:04,617
To find out why frozen fish
are being sent to border towns

647
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:05,868
of our political adversaries.

648
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,786
That's weird.

649
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:08,871
But what's weirder

650
00:26:08,873 --> 00:26:11,006
is that it's not just fish.

651
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:15,044
The official fish name
is <i>Thunnus alalunga,</i>

652
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:17,546
otherwise known
as albacore tuna.

653
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:20,266
And when I decided to
take a closer look...

654
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:22,218
Adson's retractor.

655
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:24,770
(whispers): That one.
Oh.

656
00:26:25,555 --> 00:26:29,191
...I found something
very odd.

657
00:26:29,193 --> 00:26:31,143
Forceps.

658
00:26:36,983 --> 00:26:38,784
Is that a cell phone?
Yep.

659
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:40,786
There's a cell phone
inside the fish?

660
00:26:40,788 --> 00:26:42,204
There is a
cell phone...

661
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:44,189
inside...

662
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:46,458
every fish.
Is there anything on them?

663
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,910
So far,
they're all unregistered,

664
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:51,347
but I noticed that their
IMEI numbers indicate

665
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:53,799
they all came from the
same manufacturing batch.

666
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:56,418
I was able to do a wideband
search of the batch number,

667
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,387
and I found an active cell
in the group.

668
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:01,557
Someone with a fish phone
made a phone call.

669
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,892
To...?
To... our missing accountant's

670
00:27:03,894 --> 00:27:05,644
private voicemail.

671
00:27:05,646 --> 00:27:08,981
I'm guessing from the length of
the call that they knew the password.

672
00:27:08,983 --> 00:27:11,600
It may be him.
It's a good bet.

673
00:27:11,602 --> 00:27:14,937
There was nothing useful
in the voice mail, but...

674
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:16,689
(beeping)

675
00:27:19,058 --> 00:27:22,244
...I got the location
of the caller.

676
00:27:23,013 --> 00:27:25,230
ZIVA:
No sign of Lambert.

677
00:27:25,232 --> 00:27:27,950
Same here.
And I'm getting tired.

678
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:31,403
Didn't get enough sleep
last night, huh?

679
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:35,574
This is a wild-goose chase.

680
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:37,343
Guy made one
phone call from here.

681
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:39,044
He's long gone.
Well, you can always

682
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:42,765
go back to NCIS, wait for
Diane to come back from ICE.

683
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:44,967
But we should leave
no stone unturned.

684
00:27:44,969 --> 00:27:47,936
Speaking of the
Spawn of Unholiness,

685
00:27:47,938 --> 00:27:51,357
I did some checking with a
buddy of mine at the IRS--

686
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,941
know what I heard?
That's she's

687
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:56,612
not leaving Victor, it's Victor
thinking about leaving her?

688
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:59,598
How did you know that?
Can't say I'm surprised, either.

689
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,433
You ever notice how
she never gets sick?

690
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:02,785
Even germs don't like her.

691
00:28:02,787 --> 00:28:05,604
But this Victor thing explains
something else that I heard,

692
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:07,216
something that I suspect
you <i>don't</i> know,

693
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:08,875
since you don't look nauseous.

694
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:11,160
I don't get nauseous.

695
00:28:11,162 --> 00:28:12,044
We'll see about that.

696
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:13,962
Mm.
Ask yourself something.

697
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:15,381
What are the odds

698
00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:18,967
of Diane being assigned a case
in your jurisdiction?

699
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:22,721
Pretty good. She <i>was.</i>

700
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:25,140
No. She wasn't.

701
00:28:25,142 --> 00:28:27,009
She was originally

702
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:29,895
working a different jurisdiction
on this tax fraud thing.

703
00:28:29,897 --> 00:28:33,599
When the identity theft
was traced to a Navy bar,

704
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:36,352
Diane asked to be transferred
to your jurisdiction.

705
00:28:36,354 --> 00:28:38,437
That's right.

706
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:42,191
I can hear those stomach
acids gurgling from here.

707
00:28:42,193 --> 00:28:44,410
Her father was Navy.

708
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:46,412
I worked for NCIS.

709
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:49,365
Diane, she's just
more familiar with the military.

710
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:51,483
You keep telling
yourself that.

711
00:28:51,485 --> 00:28:53,485
Because you know
what I think?

712
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:55,371
I think she asked
for a transfer

713
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:57,823
because she was hoping
to run into you.

714
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:01,710
Looks like McGee has got
a little competition.

715
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:04,713
Boss, it's Lambert,
on your nine.

716
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:10,052
GIBBS: Okay,
here we go.

717
00:29:10,054 --> 00:29:11,553
Let's move.

718
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:18,727
Oliver Lambert?

719
00:29:19,562 --> 00:29:21,280
Yes?

720
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:22,531
NCIS.

721
00:29:23,867 --> 00:29:26,184
FBI.
Need you to come with us.

722
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:28,620
FORNELL: Would you take your hands out
of your pockets, please, sir?

723
00:29:34,026 --> 00:29:37,045
The money I took from the IRS
wasn't for me.

724
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:40,132
I'd love to hear about that;
I'd love to see your hands even more.

725
00:29:41,968 --> 00:29:44,386
Put your hands
where we can see 'em.

726
00:29:48,141 --> 00:29:50,893
I was just trying
to set things right.

727
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:53,095
Sudden moves are
not your friend.

728
00:29:53,097 --> 00:29:54,730
But I'll...

729
00:29:54,732 --> 00:29:57,316
tell you everything now.

730
00:29:57,318 --> 00:29:58,817
I gave them

731
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:00,385
this week's payment,
but they're worried.

732
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:03,739
I... I think they
might try and kill me.

733
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:04,773
Hands!

734
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:34,853
Ducky confirmed Lambert died
of multiple stab wounds.

735
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:36,688
ZIVA: Fornell is still
taking statements,

736
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,274
but witnesses report
seeing Lambert in a car

737
00:30:39,276 --> 00:30:42,594
with either a man, a woman
or nobody, depending on who you talk to.

738
00:30:42,596 --> 00:30:44,763
Lambert said the money
he took wasn't for him.

739
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:46,948
TONY: Sounded like he was in the
hole to somebody for something.

740
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,450
McGEE:
One of his clients.

741
00:30:48,452 --> 00:30:50,485
Abby found this thumb drive
in his wallet.

742
00:30:50,487 --> 00:30:52,954
Looks like Lambert was gathering
evidence to cop a plea.

743
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:55,374
His files show that he embezzled
from one of his clients,

744
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:56,608
then blew the money
at the track--

745
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,443
and he had a statement
for the D.A.

746
00:30:58,445 --> 00:31:00,278
It says that the client
threatened to kill him

747
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,780
if he didn't repay
the money he took,

748
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:03,415
then forced him
to steal from the IRS.

749
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:06,134
And then some.
Client must be a scary guy.

750
00:31:06,136 --> 00:31:08,286
You got a name?
No. Lambert left it out.

751
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,838
Well, maybe he's holding it
for his plea bargain.

752
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,307
Okay. That was Diane;
she's on her way.

753
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:13,725
Her fish BOLO came back.

754
00:31:13,727 --> 00:31:15,644
Customs found
another container

755
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:16,961
headed for Donggang, China.

756
00:31:16,963 --> 00:31:18,630
More cell phones?
No.

757
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:20,148
This time they
found DVD's

758
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,900
and luxury soaps
inside the fish.

759
00:31:21,902 --> 00:31:23,852
Client's a smuggler.
Put up maps.

760
00:31:23,854 --> 00:31:26,855
GIBBS: There's U.N. sanctions
on all these countries.

761
00:31:26,857 --> 00:31:28,273
Which means
no Western cell phones,

762
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:30,992
<i>Dora</i> DVD's
or lavender-scented bath soap.

763
00:31:30,994 --> 00:31:34,162
And I thought the middle class
here was having a hard time.

764
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:36,114
Diane's contact thinks
the smuggler is using

765
00:31:36,116 --> 00:31:38,500
local fishermen to get the goods
across sanctioned borders.

766
00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:40,085
Apparently,
it is quite common.

767
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:41,740
GIBBS: Was Diane able
to trace the shipment?

768
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:42,655
It was a dead-end.

769
00:31:42,656 --> 00:31:44,506
Shipper's info
was all fake.

770
00:31:44,508 --> 00:31:46,425
Well, it's a good thing
you can't fake DNA.

771
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:48,844
Because I've got some.

772
00:31:48,846 --> 00:31:50,245
So, I ran DNA on our tuna

773
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:52,047
to try to figure out
where it came from.

774
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:54,499
Sadly, for those of
us investigating fish-based crime,

775
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:56,551
there's no national database
to compare it to.

776
00:31:56,553 --> 00:31:57,886
But...?

777
00:31:57,888 --> 00:31:59,855
My fifth favorite word.

778
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:03,141
<i>But...</i> I sent Jimmy to
pick up albacore tuna

779
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:05,677
from every supermarket
between here and Alexandria,

780
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,163
and I got a familial match.

781
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:10,532
Our smuggle fish
definitely came

782
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:12,567
from the same catch
as our sample

783
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:14,786
from F&G Grocery.

784
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:17,572
And they buy their albacore
from a man named...

785
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:19,858
DIANE: Avis Boyle.
He owns a small

786
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,877
fish distributor that serves
the tristate area.

787
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,795
<i>And</i> according
to his tax return,

788
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:25,997
he was a client
of Oliver Lambert.

789
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:27,382
He's our smuggler.

790
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:29,968
Abby already briefed me.

791
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,369

792
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:32,671
Let it go.

793
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:34,673
We have to figure out
our next move.

794
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:36,391
Our next move is
arresting Boyle.

795
00:32:36,393 --> 00:32:38,727
For what?
That's right, Woodchuck.

796
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:40,145
You can't tie him
to Lambert's murder.

797
00:32:40,147 --> 00:32:41,646
The books don't mention
Boyle by name.

798
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:42,931
And the fish DNA...

799
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:44,599
It's circumstantial.
Now,

800
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:46,935
the IRS has had their eye
on this guy for some time,

801
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:48,737
for undeclared earnings,
but they could never prove it.

802
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:50,405
But you got an idea.

803
00:32:50,407 --> 00:32:52,407
And it's a good one.
Why do I feel

804
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:54,576
like I'm being set up?
Not you. Boyle.

805
00:32:54,578 --> 00:32:56,328
So his accountant
was laundering his money.

806
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,496
But now the
accountant's dead.

807
00:32:57,498 --> 00:32:59,230
Well, Boyle's

872
00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:02,213
I used to work
with Lambert.

873
00:36:02,215 --> 00:36:04,265
I did all that
jackass's grunt work.

874
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:05,917
And when I say all,

875
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:07,268
I mean all.

876
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,853
But he's gone
and I'm here.

877
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:11,139
So, what's it gonna be?

878
00:36:13,592 --> 00:36:16,895
Oh. I see I'm not
talking to The Man,

879
00:36:16,897 --> 00:36:19,931
which means you're just a
big waste of my time. See ya.

880
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:21,483
Uh...

881
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,604
Wait here.

882
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,797
(chuckles)
She's a natural.

883
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:38,216
She's just being herself.

884
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:45,056
(door opens)

885
00:36:48,978 --> 00:36:50,612
Uh-oh.

886
00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:52,147
We have a problem.

887
00:36:52,149 --> 00:36:53,131
What is it?

888
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:54,933
(beeping)

889
00:36:54,935 --> 00:36:57,218
ZIVA: The guy from
the check-cashing place.

890
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:02,306
Avis told me someone was making
a play to be my new accountant.

891
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:03,691
He didn't mention

892
00:37:03,693 --> 00:37:06,578
it was an IRS special agent.

893
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:14,002
Walk.

894
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:22,460
(glass clinking)

895
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:25,213
GIBBS:
I'd like to propose a toast.

896
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:30,168
May you two always be as happy
as you are today.

897
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,520
WOMAN: Aw...
(lively chatter, applause)

898
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:36,191
GIBBS:
And while I'm at it,

899
00:37:36,193 --> 00:37:37,475
I'd like to propose
something else,

900
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:40,111
this time to the lovely lady
with the lovely red hair.

901
00:37:40,113 --> 00:37:43,148
WOMAN:
Aw...

902
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,900
I'm not much for words.

903
00:37:47,653 --> 00:37:49,871
Most things are
better left unsaid.

904
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:52,040
It'd be a lot easier if I

905
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,659
could just pick you up
and we'd start running, and...

906
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:56,327
we'd never stop.

907
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:59,214
Maybe I'll
still do that.

908
00:37:59,216 --> 00:38:01,416
But before I do...

909
00:38:03,385 --> 00:38:06,554
(women gasping)
...I just want to ask you one thing.

910
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,676
Yes.

911
00:38:11,678 --> 00:38:13,094
(women laughing)

912
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:15,146
I'll marry you.

913
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:17,482
(cheering, clapping)

914
00:38:17,484 --> 00:38:19,734
(whistling, whooping)

915
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:25,440
Not so fast.

916
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:27,075
Let's go.

917
00:38:28,027 --> 00:38:32,063
How come you didn't
just shoot him?

918
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:36,400
Ah, I figure... we've
ruined enough weddings.

919
00:38:36,402 --> 00:38:38,036
Yeah.

920
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:40,004
DIANE:
<i>We were wrong.</i>

921
00:38:40,006 --> 00:38:41,956
Boyle wasn't
the boss-- turns out

922
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,574
he was just one
of four distributors

923
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:45,260
that was involved
in the smuggling operation.

924
00:38:45,262 --> 00:38:46,911
This is
the big guy.

925
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:49,464
Gordon Fremont.
He was running the entire op

926
00:38:49,466 --> 00:38:51,582
out of his check-
cashing franchise.

927
00:38:51,584 --> 00:38:53,218
Lot of cash
moving in and out.

928
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,802
Easy for him
to launder the money.

929
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:56,921
Was he the one that put the
hit out on the Fornells?

930
00:38:56,923 --> 00:38:58,022
It's Sterling, remember?

931
00:38:58,024 --> 00:38:59,090
I changed
my name before

932
00:38:59,092 --> 00:39:00,424
the ink dried
on my divorce papers.

933
00:39:00,426 --> 00:39:01,776
You never had
it so good!

934
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:03,111
Okay, you were a step up

935
00:39:03,113 --> 00:39:04,779
from the last one,
but still subpar.

936
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:05,323
Hey!

937
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:07,157
VANCE: Don't make me
separate you three.

938
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:09,150
Truth is,

939
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:11,319
I'm proud of the way
you pulled this off.

940
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:12,954
DIANE:
At least I didn't kill them.

941
00:39:12,956 --> 00:39:15,073
I've had root canals
that went better.

942
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:17,158
As a matter of fact,
we were discussing

943
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,910
the possibility of...

944
00:39:18,912 --> 00:39:21,963
making the three of you
a permanent working group

945
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:24,832
for inter-agency-related
business.

946
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:29,170
That something you think
you might be interested in?

947
00:39:38,264 --> 00:39:40,464
(dog barking in distance)

948
00:39:46,322 --> 00:39:48,523
You coming down?

949
00:39:49,308 --> 00:39:52,443
(sighs)
No.

950
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:55,330
I was gonna sneak out, actually.

951
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:59,117
But, you know, since
you caught me...

952
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,369
(laughs):
I could use a drink.

953
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:06,791
(liquid pouring)

954
00:40:11,797 --> 00:40:13,848
That was a
sweet proposal.

955
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,500
I thought you said
you didn't remember it.

956
00:40:17,336 --> 00:40:19,854
Yeah. Well...

957
00:40:19,856 --> 00:40:21,973
I thought you didn't, either.

958
00:40:21,975 --> 00:40:24,392
I certainly didn't remember
how sweet it was.

959
00:40:27,346 --> 00:40:29,063
(dog barking in distance)

960
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:30,681
(sighs)

961
00:40:30,683 --> 00:40:33,952
Uh, last time I was here,
I accused you of something.

962
00:40:33,954 --> 00:40:36,537
I said, um...

963
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:39,490
that you never
loved me, and...

964
00:40:39,492 --> 00:40:41,743
you didn't correct me.

965
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:46,581
But I think I was wrong.

966
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:51,886
(laughs softly)

967
00:40:51,888 --> 00:40:54,055
Not that you're gonna
do anything about it

968
00:40:54,057 --> 00:40:55,890
but stare at me right now.

969
00:40:57,626 --> 00:41:00,044
Thanks for your help.
You got give Victor a break.

970
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:02,230
Excuse me?

971
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:05,266
Who told you that Victor
and I are having prob...

972
00:41:05,268 --> 00:41:07,819
Oh, it was Chucky.
He's such a dead man.

973
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:09,437
(sighs)

974
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:12,357
Okay, what do I have to
give Victor a break for?

975
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:16,194
For being him...

976
00:41:16,196 --> 00:41:18,746
and not somebody else.

977
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:24,168
You got to let it go, Diane.

978
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:29,173
I couldn't...

979
00:41:29,175 --> 00:41:32,760
and I drove everybody away.

980
00:41:36,298 --> 00:41:37,965
And...

981
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:41,085
the last thing
you want to be is me.

982
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,442
(whispers):
You're not so bad.

983
00:41:47,444 --> 00:41:48,776
(laughs softly)

984
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:57,902
But I hear you.

985
00:41:57,904 --> 00:42:00,371
Unfortunately, it might
be a little too late.

986
00:42:00,373 --> 00:42:01,939
No, it's not.

987
00:42:01,941 --> 00:42:03,107
(laughs)

988
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:05,076
How do you know
everything?

989
00:42:05,078 --> 00:42:06,911
I don't.

990
00:42:06,913 --> 00:42:08,779
I don't. I...

991
00:42:08,781 --> 00:42:11,782
I just learned
how to listen.

992
00:42:16,288 --> 00:42:19,640
Well, what about you?

993
00:42:19,642 --> 00:42:23,511
Don't you think there's
somebody out there for you?

994
00:42:23,513 --> 00:42:27,482
Or are you destined to spend
the rest of your days alone?

995
00:42:33,572 --> 00:42:35,740
I'm not alone.

996
