- That's good advice.
- Are we cool?

344
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:32,808
- We're cool.
- Give me a hug.

345
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:34,577
- Okay.
- It's all good.

346
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:36,345
- Not tonight.
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

347
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:37,913
Hey, Mindy.
Mindy. Mindy.

348
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:39,415
Mindy!

349
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:42,851
Don't go up there.

350
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:45,154
[Sighs]
[Door closes]

351
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,334
A little bit,
there's three different things--

352
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:49,402
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

353
00:10:49,436 --> 00:10:50,470
I can't reach something
in the closet.

354
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:52,505
- Will you help me?
- Sure.

355
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:56,776
Is this real,
or is this, like, code

356
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,177
for some mid-party
delight?

357
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:00,246
What do you think?

358
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,848
'Cause I have been drinking.

359
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:03,583
So it might take me
a little longer

360
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:05,751
to get the old lawnmower
started, but...

361
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:06,953
It will function.

362
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:08,020
Hey, Josh...

363
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:09,622
How's San Antonio?

364
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:12,191
I'm just lying here
in bed without you.

365
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:14,260
I can't wait for you
to come back home.

366
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:15,795
Love you.
[Smooches]

367
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:17,430
Oh, God.

368
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:18,598
Who is she, Josh?

369
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:19,699
How did you find out?

370
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,200
You left your stupid phone
in my phone charger,

371
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:23,202
- and I thought it was mine.
- This is not what it looks like.

372
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:24,237
I promise.

373
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:25,238
Why do you have
a bowling ball?

374
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:26,239
Couple years ago,

375
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:27,607
I joined a league
of all-female OBs.

376
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:29,275
The name of our team
was storks and strikes,

377
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:30,343
like "Stars and Stripes."

378
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:31,811
It was clever.
Josh, who is she?

379
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:33,045
She's an ex!

380
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,113
She's almost an ex.

381
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:35,248
We started dating,
like, a year ago,

382
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:36,282
and I tried to break up
with her.

383
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:37,550
I did,
a couple times.

384
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:39,018
But then her dog started
having these kidney issues,

385
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:40,753
and when a dog
has kidney issues--

386
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,389
- I'm sorry, a year ago?
- Yeah, a year, year and a half, tops.

387
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:45,791
We haven't been dating
that long.

388
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:48,895
Are you telling me that
she's not the other woman,

389
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:50,630
I am the other woman?

390
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:52,465
No, I wouldn't put it
that way.

391
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:53,599
This is horrible.

392
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:55,568
You are horrible.

393
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:58,171
Please fake a work emergency
and get out.

394
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:04,343
Oh, here,
and you have a message

395
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:05,778
from your
credit card company.

396
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:06,913
Early fraud warning.

397
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:09,615
I'm only now realizing
the irony of that.

398
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,184
[Indistinct chatter]

399
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:12,618
Everyone say
good-bye to Josh.

400
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:14,120
He has to go
immediately, so...

401
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:15,721
Ohh.
Yeah.

402
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:18,357
Yeah.
Big sports emergency.

403
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,092
Kobe Bryant
has been shot.

404
00:12:20,127 --> 00:12:21,694
(All) What?
- No, it's fine.

405
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:24,297
- Kobe Bryant is a famous
basketball player. - Yeah.

406
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:25,965
<i>- He'll probably never</i>
<i>play basketball again.</i> - No.

407
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:26,999
- Oh, no, wait a second.
- Yeah.

408
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:28,301
It--it's fine.

409
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:30,136
Is he going to live
through the night?

410
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,170
It's touch and go.
Gonna be fine.

411
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:33,506
Then you are gonna
stay here...

412
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,640
Appreciate it.
I appreciate it actually.

413
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:35,908
He wishes he could,
but he has to help kobe.

414
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:37,610
<i>Gotta go.</i>
Mindy's Christmas speech!

415
00:12:37,644 --> 00:12:38,711
[Applause]
<i>Morgan...</i>

416
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:40,513
The Bryant family
needs Josh right now.

417
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:41,614
<i>(Morgan)</i> <i>Phil Jackson</i>
<i>can help the Bryants.</i>

418
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:43,316
I want you to personally
guarantee me

419
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,650
you will stay
for this speech.

420
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:46,852
<i>You're gonna love it.</i>
<i>Say yes, Josh.</i>

421
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:47,853
(All)
Come on.

422
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:48,854
<i>Come on, Josh.</i>

423
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:49,855
Yeah.

424
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,856
Oh, boy, he's in!

425
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:52,258
[Applause]

426
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,793
<i>Ahem!</i>

427
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:56,829
Joan of Arc,
Eleanor Roosevelt,

428
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,831
Margaret Meade...

429
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:01,601
Are all literally scum

430
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:04,370
compared to the woman that's
about to take this microphone.

431
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:07,506
I call her the thunder
from down under.

432
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,009
Give it up
for Dr. Mindy Lahiri!

433
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:13,679
[Cheers and applause]

434
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:15,381
No, no, get up
on the stage--

435
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:16,983
the stairs right here.
Everyone can see you.

436
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:18,985
- I think someone's a little shy.
- I'm not shy.

437
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,186
You're a little shy.

438
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,487
Let's give her
another round of applause.

439
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:23,189
[Applause] Please
stand on the stairs.

440
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:25,324
There you go.
Gotta get a good seat.

441
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:26,592
Is this high enough?

442
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:28,227
I think
that's great.

443
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:32,932
Um, "Thank you all
for attending..."

444
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,100
Please speak up.
Share your voice.

445
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:36,736
"Josh and my Christmas party.

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,071

455

Come on, this is
the worst Christmas speech

456
00:13:58,292 --> 00:13:59,292
I've ever heard.
Come on.

457
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:00,426
Christmas speech.

458
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,861
That's an important thing,
right?

459
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:02,928
<i>- Yes!</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

460
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:04,430
Big deal.
Title of this speech

461
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:06,899
is "I love you guys so much,
I can't even deal."

462
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,267
- Ohh.
- Oh, boy.

00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:10,002
Okay, "Thank you all

465
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:13,906
Okay, let's--
let's just keep this...

466
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,276
Uh, "and in that spirit,
we could all gather close"

467
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:18,411
and join Han--"
I'm not gonna--

468
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:19,679
I'm not saying that.

469
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:21,047
Join hands? Okay.
No, don't join hands.

470
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:22,648
Yeah, let go.
Uh, skipping down.

471
00:14:22,683 --> 00:14:24,216
How many pages
you got here?

472
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:26,485
[Chuckles tearfully]
Um, like, eight or nine pages.

473
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,220
Eight or nine.

474
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:29,789
Yeah, that's a lot
for a, uh, party.

475
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:32,224
- I had a lot to say.
- Yeah. Well, that's good.

476
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:33,225
I love that.
That's great.

477
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,627
Okay.
I'm gonna just, uh...

478
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:36,395
Should I go
to the conclusion?

"In, uh, in conclusion,

- Who's Mindy?
- Heather?

Yeah!

490
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:00,453
I'm here to meet
your mistress, Josh.

491
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,816
How did you know
I was here?

492
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:05,884
I used
the phone tracker app.

493
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,219
We have the same password,
remember?

494
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:08,553
You share a password?

495
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,021
Damn right we do.

496
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:11,156
It's our dead dog's name.

497
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,458
You co-owned a dog,
Josh?

498
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:15,126
- Come on. Now, wait.
- The kidney dog?

499
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,661
She knows
about Princess Buttercup?

500
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,997
Princess Buttercup is the name
of your dog, Josh?

501
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:20,131
- Come on--
- Great!

502
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,800
Now I have to change
my password!

503
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:22,934
Oh, my God.
Oh, my G--

504
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:24,569
- Oh, my God.
- Do you have a key necklace?

505
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:27,772
Okay, she has
a key necklace, everyone,

506
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:30,475
except hers is encrusted
in diamonds,

507
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,776
and mine
just features diamonds.

<i>Danny, did you see that?</i>

509
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:34,913
Okay, so this
is where you've been

to Sacramento...

<i>(Danny)</i>
<i>That's not cool.</i>
