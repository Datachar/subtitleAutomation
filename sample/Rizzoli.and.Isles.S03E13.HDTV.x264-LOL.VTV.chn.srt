1
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,930
你又回来干什么
What are you doing back?

2
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,940
我不想再重复这事了
We can't go over this again.

3
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,620
回家吧  睡个好觉
Go home. Get some sleep.

4
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,460
看着自己的妈这样忘记情伤可真诡异的
It is so weird watching your mother try to rebound.

5
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,800
她肯用心打扮一下是个好兆头
Well, taking care of her appearance is a good sign, actually.

6
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,250
她在跟一切会走的东西调情
She's flirting with everything that moves.

7
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,910
她有没有说她和卡瓦诺夫分手的原因
Did she tell you why Cavanaugh broke it off?

8
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,520
没有
No.

9
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,920
我倒希望她能说出来
I wish she'd talk about it.

10
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,280
你知道女人一生中平均要摄入
Do you know the average woman ingests 7 pounds of lipstick

11
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,610
七磅唇膏吗
over a lifetime?

12
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,040
你为什么坚持不懈地在食物面前
Why do you insist on telling me

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,450
跟我分享倒胃口的有趣事实
your disgusting fun facts over food?

14
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,540
那是咖啡
It's coffee.

15
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,960
-你好啊美女  -你好
- Hiya, doll! - Hi!

16
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,200
警探好
Detective.

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,870
这么多傻瓜可供她选择
Of all the knuckleheads she's gonna flirt with --

18
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,770
她就非得跟闪电麦坤调情吗[汽车总动员2的角色]
She has to flirt with Lightning McQueen?

19
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,550
我以为他叫吉布森警探
I thought his name was detective Gibson.

20
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,210
他隶属偷车特别小组
I believe he's part of the auto-theft task force.

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,970
这可以解释为什么他这么自大
That explains why he's so arrogant.

22
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,360
看好了
Watch this. Watch.

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,760
如果用车来形容你
If you were a car,

24
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,780
我会说是68年产的道奇战马
you'd be a '68 Dodge charger --

25
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,060
外观时髦  路跑的性能好
Sleek styling, great street performance.

26
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,380
警探你好
Hey, detective.

27
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,860
我在跟你妈妈聊着
I was, uh, I was just telling your mother

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,640
我们找到的68年产的道奇战马
about this, uh, '68 dodge charger we recovered.

29
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,720
真的吗
Really?

30
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,210
我以为你要称赞她的好身材呢
I thought you were about to compliment her on her trunk space.

31
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,540
简
Jane!

32
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,500
早上好  警督
Good morning, lieutenant.

33
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,330
有什么好的
What's good about it?

34
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,550
所以  高帅富你照惯例下单吗
So...rich, I guess you'll have your usual.

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,240
安琪拉  你怎么这么了解我呢
Angela, how can you know me so well?

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,230
现在她是在想让卡瓦诺夫吃醋吗
Now she's trying to make Cavanaugh jealous?

37
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,830
吃醋有时候是爱或者承诺的表现
Jealousy can sometimes be a sign of love or commitment.

38
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,120
也可能是闪电麦坤将要遭殃
It can also be a sign that Lightning McQueen

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,360
的一个信号
is about to get his ass kicked.

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,890
晚点见  美女
So, I'll be seeing you, beautiful.

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,090
好的  再见
Okay. Bye, rich.

42
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,010
-我打电话给你  -好的
- I will call you. - Okay.

43
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,880
里佐利夫人  如果你有空
Hey, Mrs. Rizzoli, if you're not too busy,

44
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,700
可不可以来这里加点咖啡
can I get some coffee over here?

45
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,440
马上来  警督
Right away, lieutenant.

46
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,810
我看不下去了
I can't watch any more.

47
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,470
我们不能袖手旁观
We have to do something.

48
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,790
要怎么做  把塑料刀都藏起来吗
What? Hide all the plastic knives?

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
小香草
Vanilla.

50
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,080
就在找你呢
Just who I was looking for.

51
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,110
我以为你想喝咖啡
I thought you wanted some coffee.

52
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,370
不用了
Uh, never mind.

53
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,320
你好  朗多先生  这是什么情况
Hello, Mr. Rondo. Who do we have here?

54
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,890
他们是罗本  丹尼亚  特雷弗
Reuben, Dania, Trevor.

55
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,050
我叫道格[狗]
It's Dawg.

56
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,740
你好吗  道格
How do you do, Dawg?

57
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,760
朗多  我们已经过了参加儿童聚会的年龄了
Rondo, aren't we a little old for playdates?

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,420
他们是我在"街边"的朋友
These are all my homies from "Off the street."

59
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,370
青少年寄宿处?
The home for teenagers?

60
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,470
我在那里当志愿者
I volunteer there.

61
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,350
我们是"朗多的次品"
We're "Rondo's rejects."

62
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,960
也许你们可以换个没这么贬义的名字
Perhaps you'd consider a less pejorative name.

63
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,240
青少年通常认同于社会对他们的定位
Juveniles often identify with the labels society gives them.

64
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,930
社会没给他们定位  名字是他们自己取的
Oh, society didn't name them. They named their own selves.

65
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,840
次品是指达不到
Um, a reject is a person or thing

66
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,120
-正常标准的人或物  -莫拉
- dismissed as failing to meet standards -- - Maura.

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,210
"贬义"是表示
"Pejorative" is a word

68
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,040
蔑视或者谴责的词语
that expresses contempt or disapproval.

69
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,480
我带他们来是见英雄的
Brought 'em by to meet my heroes --

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,470
"职业日"的即兴活动
a little impromptu "Career Day."

71
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,100
所以你们想当警察吗
Wow. So you guys want to be cops?

72
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,280
才不要
No. No way.

73
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,680
他们只是要些指导
They just need a little mentoring.

74
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,070
你可不可以带他们逛一下
Maybe you could... take 'em around a little?

75
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,640
我也可以当导师  有谁喜欢烹饪吗
I-I could be a mentor, too. Does anybody like cooking?

76
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,660
烹饪
Cooking!

77
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,270
-或者科学  -科学
- Or science? - Science!

78
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,080
好了  妈  给他们准备甜甜圈
Okay, ma, why don't you give them a doughnut,

79
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,270
然后你们喜欢什么就什么吧
and we'll let you be on your way?

80
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,140
我同意
Fine by me.

81
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,720
就是  反正我是不会跟女人学习的
Right? I ain't being mentored by no chick, anyway.

82
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,350
现在我想了一下
You know, now that I think about it,

83
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,130
我们喜欢当导师
we love to mentor here.

84
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,380
如果你们喜欢的话  可以找个男警探
And we can find a boy detective, if that's what you'd prefer.

85
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,920
弗罗斯特警探当你的导师
Detective Frost could be your mentor.

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,120
科萨克警司可以当你的导师
And Sergeant Korsak could be your mentor.

87
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,930
如果非得给我找导师
If I have to have a mentor,

88
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,360
我希望他有高级学位
I'd rather it be someone with an advanced degree.

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,660
我有医学博士学位
I have an M.D.

90
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,920
行
Okay, I guess.

91
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,210
有东西吃吗
You got anything to eat?

92
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,960
妈  我们得走了  有案件
Okay, ma, we got to go. We got a case.

93
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,690
进来吧  我给你们做早饭
All right, come on. I'll make you all breakfast.

94
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,240

你看见那边的几个小孩没
You see those teenagers over there?

99
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,430
查一下名字  确保他们没杀过人
Run their names -- make sure they haven't killed anybody.

100
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,560
你是指围着妈的那个人吗
You mean the ones standing 6 inches from ma?

101
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,820
或许你应该别让他们走出你视线范围
You probably shouldn't let them out of your sight, either.

102
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,670
如果天行者没有尤达大师会怎么办[星球大战人物]

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,430
你在说你穿越时空回到一世纪吗

109
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,990
是公元前三世纪

110
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,960

116
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,440
他是制作微酿啤酒的  这是他的实验厨房

她有不在场证据吗

这可真是个不一般的伤口啊
That's a very unusual entrance wound.

137
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,680
他是被什么刺伤的
What was he stabbed with?

138
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,600
不是刀
Not a knife.

139
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,250
我们又是在玩排除法吗
Are we playing "Process of elimination" again?

140
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
答对了
Yes.

141
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,000
凶器不是垃圾处理器
It's not a garbage disposal,

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,410
不是劈刀  不是干草叉
Cleaver, pitchfork,

143

好的
Right.

146
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,770
但这个东西看起来像是个铆钉
But this...appears to be a metal rivet.

147
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,780
可能是从作案工具上掉下来的
Maybe it came off the murder weapon.

148
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,110
发现了些血滴
There's some blood droplets...

149
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,950
一直滴到了碾磨器这里
...leading into that mill.

150
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,700
我觉得我们找到了作案凶器
I think we just found what's left of our murder weapon.

151
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,740
血迹确认了棍子上的血是扬森的
The trace confirmed that the blood on the stick belonged to Jensen.

152
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,340
你觉得一根削尖的棍子能造成这样的伤害吗
You think a sharpened stick could do that kind of damage?

153
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,820
是的
Yeah.

154
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,290
尽管还无法解释铆钉是怎么来的
Doesn't explain the metal rivet, though.

155
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,180
嘿  简
Hey. Jane.

156
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,370
天哪  弗兰基  对不起  
Oh, my g-- Frankie, I'm so sorry.

157
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,590
没关系
Oh, no problem.

158
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,130
我一直在和你的徒弟们有说有笑呢
I've been having a barrel of laughs with your mentees.

159
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,100
谁收了徒弟吗
Who has mentees?

160
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,690
额  是你
Um...you.

161
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,800
还有你
And you.

162
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,760
显然莫拉和简把我们都变成了志愿者
Apparently, Maura and Jane volunteered all of us --

163
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,580
带他们参观了嫌犯登记  一些用品
Toured booking, properties.

164
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,260
我刚还想向他们展示如何写交通罚单的呢
I was just about to show them how I write a traffic ticket.

165
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,040
你一直在打呼噜
This is snore-ville -- population, you.

166
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,970
他们现在归你们了
They're all yours.

167
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,760
你好
Hey. Hello.

168
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,840
嗨
Hi!

169
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,530
请别玩这个
Please... don't play with that.

170
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,070
为什么你有个玩偶
Why you got a doll, man?

171
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,180
我想我能否去看下法医
I was wondering if I could go see the medical examiner,

172
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,860
兴许能看看尸检过程
Maybe check out an autopsy?

173
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,310
不行
Uh...no.

174
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,190
为什么不行
Why not?

175
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,960
因为这个不在日程安排上
'cause it's not on the itinerary.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,680
我正在学高阶生物学
I'm taking A.P. Bio, so --

177
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,530
-高阶生物学吗  -没错
- Advanced-placement biology? - Yeah

178
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,580
怎么  你觉得次品少年就不配聪明吗
What, you think a reject kid can't be smart?

179
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,660
至少次品少年不玩玩偶
At least reject kids don't play with dolls.

180
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,540
我赌你管这个玩偶叫仿真玩具人
Wait. I bet you call him an action figure,

181
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,640
对吗  兄弟
right, bro?

182
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,410
没错  如果你敢再动它一下
Yes, and if you touch my "Action figure" Again,

183
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,090
我就打烂你的脸
I will break your face.

184
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,730
如果我能观摩一场尸检的话
If I could observe an autopsy,

185
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,470
就可以给我加额外学分了
it'd count for extra credit.

186
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,240
好吧
Okay, fine.

187
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,940
但你得让你的父母签
But you need to have your parents sign

188
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,100
这个豁免责任书
this liability release waiver.

189
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,640
不是这样的  丹尼亚  是你的父母
No, Dania, your parents got to --

190
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,470
这是合法的  我有自主权
It's legal. I'm emancipated.

191
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,620
我的妈妈死了  我的爸爸在监狱里
My mom's dead, and my dad's in prison.

192
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,600
如果你不信的话  这是我的资料
If you don't believe me, here are my documents.

193
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,970
好吧  跟我来
Okay. Come on.

194
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,930
等等  我们也想看看尸体
W-w-w-w-wait. We want to see dead bodies, too.

195
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,470
没错  总比在这胡扯要好
Yeah. Better than this bullshit.

196
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,780
哦  真可惜
Oh, shoot.

197
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,440
我赌现在你们真希望选的是女警探
I bet you wish you picked the "Chick" Detective now.

198
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,850
对不住了  小伙子们
Sorry, fellas.

199
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,810
把他盖起来
Cover him up.

200
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,050
盖起来  莫拉  盖起来
Cover him up, Maura. Cover him up.

201
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,090
你好
Hi.

202
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,240
你是要切Y形切口吗
You're about to do the "Y" Incision?

203
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,200
是的
Yes!

204
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,210
你知道为什么要切Y形吗  丹尼亚
And do you know why the "Y," Dania?

205
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,360
是为了更好的移动胸甲部位
To facilitate the removal of the breastplate.

206
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,540
快切吧
Go ahead. Do it.

207
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,590
不行
Uh...no.

208
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,940
豁免责任书里并未涵盖解剖尸体
Our release form doesn't cover slicing and dicing.

209
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,620
你说过我能观摩尸检的
You said I could check out an autopsy.

210
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,040
我没说是哪个部分
I didn't say which part.

211
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,960
好吧  我们要做的第一件事
Okay, so, the first thing that I do

212
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,960
就是检查尸体
is examine the body.

213
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,920
你的责任书里包括手套了吗
Does your release form cover gloves?

214
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,200
是的
Yes.

215
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,300
好了  你注意到什么了吗
All right. Do you notice anything?

216
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,470
他的小腿有些浮肿  但我看不到外伤
His leg's a little swollen, but I don't see an injury.

217
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,580
你很有洞察力
You're very observant.

218
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,830
你觉得这可能会是深静脉血栓造成的吗
You think it could be deep-vein thrombosis?

219
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,370
我是从一名战地记者的资料里读到的
I read about this war correspondent

220
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,980
他是因为在一个地方坐的太久而造成了死亡
who died from sitting in one place for too long.

221
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,010
莫拉  小心咯
Better be careful, Maura.

222
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,790
我觉得我发现了你的接替者了
I think we found your replacement.

223
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,300
我能看看伤口吗
Can I see the wound?

224
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,770
这是什么凶器造成的
What kind of weapon did that?

225
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,640
我不确定
I'm not sure.

226
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,320
但这种锯齿状的伤口边缘表明
But the ragged wound edges suggest

227
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,330
是某种带刺的刀刃所致
some kind of a barbed blade.

228
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,380
警探  你能帮我把他翻个身吗
Detective, can you help me turn him on his side?

229
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,340
没问题
Yeah, sure.

230
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,630
好的
Okay.

231
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,480
这就好
There we go.

232
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,320
我们要用莹光镜近距离看一下
We'll take a closer look with the fluoroscope.

233
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,360
有东西卡在t-8部位了
There's something lodged near t-8.

234
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,370
看起来像是某种矛尖
Looks like some kind of spear tip.

235
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,760
它看起来像是一种铁制的矛
It looks like an iron krokspjot.

236
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,970
哈  正如我猜的那样
Aha! Just as I suspected

237
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,670
它是个"电锅"(读错了)
-- a crockpot.

238
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,570
像这样的矛是在维京时期使用的
Krokspjots like this were used during the Viking era.

239
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,800
我觉得金属上刻的是符文
I think these are rune letters carved into the metal.

240
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,870
这种符文字母是一种古老的北欧字母
The runic alphabet is an ancient nordic one

241
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,360
早于拉丁文
that predates latin.

242
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,760
你能读懂它写的是什么吗
Can you read what it says?

243
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,630
不能  我得去咨询一下符文方面的专家
No. I'll have to consult a runic scholar.

244
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,340
格雷格・扬森销售的是维京主题的啤酒
Well, Greg Jensen sold Viking-themed beer.

245
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,530
也许矛尖是从他的酿酒厂或是咖啡中来的
Maybe the spear tip came from his brewery or his office.

246
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,320
弗罗斯特和科萨克找到了嫌疑犯的线索
Okay, Frost and Korsak have a lead on a possible suspect.

247
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,190
跟我走  丹尼亚   
Come on, Dania.

248
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,200
酷  我能看你胁迫嫌犯吗  
Cool. Can I watch you intimidate the suspect?

249
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,420
不行  但快跟上
No. But hurry.

250
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,630
我不想让你错失我妈的烹饪课
I don't want you to miss my mother's cooking class.

251
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,320
谢谢你妈的烹饪课
Thank your mom for that cooking class.

252
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,170
不然道格和罗本差不多
Dawg and Reuben almost

253
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,890
就要被敲脑袋了
got slapped upside the head.

254
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,470
科萨克  你是要打你的徒弟吗
Korsak, you were gonna hit your mentees?

255
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,420
不是我  是弗罗斯特
Not me -- Frost.

256
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,880
冷面先生不能接受青少年的态度
Mr. Chill can't take teen 'tude.

257
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,700
看看这个
Take a look at this.

258
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,150
那是霸王啤酒的标志
That is the overlord ale logo.

259
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,460
但看这个
But look at this.

260
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,290
为什么有人想要加入北欧摩托车暴力团伙
Why would a brother want to be in a nordic motorcycle gang?

261
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,150
世界毁灭骑手是个摩托俱乐部
Ragnarok riders is a motorcycclub.

262
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,070
不是暴力团伙  弗罗斯特  
It's not a gang, Frost.

263
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,260
这个摩托俱乐部的标志
Well, the motorcycle-club logo is

264
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,670
和霸王啤酒的标志很像啊
similar to overlord ale.

265
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,400
别跟我说受害者抄袭了摩托俱乐部的标志
Don't tell me our victim lifted a motorcycle club's logo.

266
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,620
还有更糟的
It gets worse.

267
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,440
看到了那个性感的维京海报女郎了吗
See the sexy Viking poster girl?

268
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,300
看到了
Yes.

269
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,740
这位是苏菲・韦斯特
Meet Sophie West.

270
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,380
这是她和她父亲
Here she is with her daddy.

271
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,320
克拉克・韦斯特  人称"杀人王"
Clark "Skull Crusher" West --

272
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,650
世界毁灭骑手的老大
head of the Ragnarok Riders.

273
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,800
他起诉了格雷格・扬森  告他侵犯版权
He sued Greg Jensen, claiming copyright infringement.

274
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,840
那是  总不能告他侵犯他女儿
Yeah, 'cause he couldn't sue for daughter infringement.

275
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,100
扬森雇了苏菲当霸王啤酒的模特
Jensen paid Sophie to be the model for Overlord Ale.

276
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,560
她父亲为了商标权起诉  却输了
Daddy sued over the logo and lost.

277
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,180
那家伙可输不起
The guy's a sore loser.

278
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,300
小心着点儿  呆子
Hey, you watch yourself, pencil neck.

279
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,430
你给我小心
You watch your back.

280
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,050
这事儿没完
This battle isn't over.

281
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,290
看来我们得去拜访一下这位"杀人王"了
Oh, I think we should pay Skull Crusher a visit.

282
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,530
不是演习  今天没安排演习
That's not a drill. Nothing's scheduled today.

283
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,750
大伙儿快离开这儿
Get the hell out of here, people!

284
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,270
现在就走  快
Let's move -- now!

285
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,500
快走
Go!

286
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,400
从内罗毕带回来的那个面具我没拿
I left my mask from Nairobi inside.

287
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,220
我没拿我的幸运笔记本
I left my lucky notepad.

288
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,390
早知道拿那幅瑞士版画了
I should've grabbed my Swiss lithographs.

289
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,000
你看那栋楼  看到烟没有
Look at this building. Do you see any smoke?

290
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,460
没有
No.

291
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,250
那你的超灵敏鼻子闻到烟味没有
And does your super-sniffer nose smell any smoke?

292
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,140
没有
No.

293
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,410
我看是朗多带来的哪个"次品"
I think one of Rondo's rejects

294
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,130
拉响了火警警报
pulled the fire alarm

295
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,980
省得听妈那"享受新鲜果蔬"的长篇大论
to get out of ma's "fun with fresh produce" lecture.

296
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,740
好了  各位
All right, everybody.

297
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,960
有人开玩笑拉了火警警报
Some joker pulled the fire alarm.

298
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,470
回去工作吧
Let's get back to work.

299
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,390
就知道是假警报
Told you -- false alarm.

300
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,570
弗兰基
Frankie!

301
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,520
妈  怎么了
Ma. What's the matter?

302
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,870
我的钱包被偷了
Someone stole my wallet!

303
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,940
好吧  我提了工资
Okay, I cashed my paycheck.

304
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,820
把钱包放进包里
I put my wallet in my purse.

305
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,030
像往常一样把包放在了柜台下面
I keep my purse underneath the counter, like I always do.

306
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,680
这可不安全
That's not very safe.

307
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,270
那是当然  莫拉  多谢提醒
Clearly, Maura. Thank you.

308
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,970
你不会以为是
You don't think...

309
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,320
没错  我就是这么想的
Yeah.Do think.

310
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,420
我也是
Me too.

311
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,170
我要把这些面具藏好
I'm gonna go put these masks away.

312
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,710
对了  把它们放保险箱里
Okay, put them in the safe.

313
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,420
我没有保险箱
I don't have a safe.

314
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,700
没人要你的面具  莫拉
No one's taking your masks, Maura.

315
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,450
行了  你们哪个偷了钱包
Okay, which one of you snapped the wallet? Hmm?

316
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,970
听着  不管是谁"找到"我妈的钱包
Look, anyone of you that "found" my mother's wallet,

317
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,920
现在交出来的话  就不告你
you return it now, we don't press charges.

318
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,150
你们听到小香草警探的话了吧
You heard Detective Vanilla.

319
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,970
你们谁有罪
If one of you is the guilty party,

320
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,820
快坦白吧
guilty party better speak up.

321
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,500
我没偷钱包
I didn't steal no wallet.

322
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,030
我也没有
Me either.

323
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,400
我要找律师
I want a lawyer.

324
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,780
站起来
Stand up.

325
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,820
快
Do it!

326
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,620
把手摊开
Hold your hands out.

327
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,780
不管谁拉的警报  手上肯定留有隐形染料
Whoever pulled the fire alarm is gonna have U.V. dye residue.

328
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,890
那又怎样
So?

329
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,520
-我碰警报器是为了关掉它  -当然了
- I touched the alarm to turn it off. - Sure you did.

330
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,580
我没偷钱包  好吗
I didn't steal no wallet, all right?

331
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,970
你们没证据
You can't prove nothin'.

332
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,980
是没有  不过拉警报这事可以告你轻罪
No, but we can file a misdemeanor for pulling the alarm.

333
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,250
你们可能不相信  但他们都是好孩子
I-I know it don't seem like it, but they're all good kids.

道格拿到了波士顿剑桥大学的奖学金
Dawg has a scholarship to BCU,

335
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,720
他要是惹上麻烦奖学金就没了
and he could lose it if he gets in trouble.

336
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,770
什么叫"要是"
"If"?

337
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,630
他已经有麻烦了
Oh, he's in trouble.

338
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,140
你找到那钱包  朗多  我们那时再谈
You find that wallet, Rondo. Then we'll talk.

339
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,690
真难受
I feel bad.

340
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,720
你以为跟我们待上二十分钟
Well, you think 20 minutes with us

341
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,540
就能彻底改变他们的人生吗

342

你们想知道什么
What do you want?

346
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,860
我们在调查一起凶案
We're investigating a homicide.

347
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,200
没问你  问这位女士呢
I wasn't asking you. I was asking the lady.

348
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,720
鄙人克拉克・韦斯特
Clark West.

349
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,170

351
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,220
不行  我可不是个好乘客
No. I'm a terrible passenger.

352
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,520
我们是来调查一起谋杀案的
We're here about a murder.

353
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,720
我很忙  正筹备慈善骑行呢

就给你们半分钟时间

360
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,480
那家伙是个混蛋
Well, guy's a prick.

361
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,410
他罪有应得
He might have had something like that coming.

362
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,680
我们看了你在法院威胁他的视频
We have video of you threatening Greg Jensen at the courthouse.

363
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,200
他盗用我俱乐部的商标

364
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,220
还让我女儿给她做广告
made my daughter his marketing bitch.

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,590
你昨天在哪儿
Where were you yesterday?

368

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,410
要看照片吗
You want to see the photos?

370
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,990
大个子卡尔把相机都拍爆了
Big Karl here maxed out the camera memory.

373

祝你们骑行顺利
Good luck with your ride.

374
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,750
谢谢
Thank you.

375
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,970
我拍了矛尖上符文的照片
I e-mailed a photo of the rune letters on the spear tip

376
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,040
发给了以前教我北欧历史的教授
to my old nordic-history professor.

377
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,160
意思是"无骨奥拉夫"
It says "Olaf the boneless."

378
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,490
是北欧海盗汤的配方吗
It's a...recipe for viking soup?

379
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,000
不知道是不是想说"伊娃"
Hmm. Could they have meant "Ivar," I wonder?

380
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,030
原来你也这么想
Mm. You too?

381
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,110
曾经有过一个北欧海盗首领叫"无骨伊娃"
Well, there was a viking leader named Ivar the boneless.

382
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,630
有学者认为他是个残疾的侏儒
Some scholars believed that he was a disabled dwarf

383
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,540
被人用盾牌抬着上战场
who was carried into battle on his shield.

384
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,050
是个真正的勇士
He was a great warrior.

385
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,960
坐着盾牌的无骨侏儒怎么能是勇士呢
How is a boneless dwarf on a shield a great warrior --

386
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,700
亏你想得出来
How do you manage to do this?

387
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,360
想什么
Do what?

388
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,700
一个无骨的侏儒
A boneless dwarf --

389
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,100
你急着找我干嘛
What was so urgent?

390
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,820
犯罪化验室在死者的防化服里面
The crime lab found seminal fluid

391
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,270
发现了混有阴道分泌物的精液

392
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,040
应该是一个月前留下的
It appears to be a month old.

393
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,030
在里面吗
"In"?

394
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,740
你是说死者大概一个月前发生了性事
So our victim had sex about a month ago

395
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,420
然后还穿这件一次性的防化服
and then wore his disposable tyvek suit again?

396
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,310
没错
Yes.

397
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,970
而且枪尖上也发现有阴道分泌物
And they also found vaginal secretions on the spear.

398
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,540
好吧  这是史上最恶心的微物迹证了
Okay, that qualifies as the grossest trace evidence ever.

399
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,950
放轻松  分泌物在这里
Relax. The secretions were here.

400
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,580
可能是沾到了
Probably from transfer.

401
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,550
差不多一个月之久了
Also about a month old.

402
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,440
两个都有足够的微孔材料来提取DNA
And there was enough cellular material in both to extract DNA.

403
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,590
我们正在处理
We're running it.

404
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,640
所以凶手可能是个女人
So our killer could be a woman.

405
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,540
因为这么锋利的武器
Well, since a weapon this sharp

406
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,470
不需要多大力气  有可能 
doesn't need much force, it's possible.

407
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,380
科萨克在询问受害者的妻子
Korsak is interviewing the victim's wife.

408
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,230
我需要一个擦拭工具
I need one of those swabby things.

409
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,860
住手  我来帮你拿
W-- stop! I'll get you whatever you're looking for.

410
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,600
可我需要更多精准的描述
But I need a more precise description.

411
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,540
一天到晚我得绞尽脑汁理解你说的话
I have to figure out what you say all day long.

412
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,870
你连"擦拭工具"都听不懂吗  是吗
You can't figure out "Swabby thing"? Really?

413
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,040
扬森夫人  这位是里佐利警探
Mrs. Jensen, this is detective Rizzoli.

414
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,220
对你丈夫的死表示遗憾
Very sorry for your loss.

415
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,320
谢谢
Thank you.

416
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,550
扬森夫人刚告诉我
Mrs. Jensen was just telling me

417
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,460
她丈夫曾经经常消失几天
that her husband often disappeared for days at a time.

418
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,290
你知道他去哪里了吗
You have any idea where he was going?

419
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,750
他说他在研究一种新的啤酒配方
He said he was working on a new ale recipe.

420
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,080
但是我很怀疑
But I had my suspicions.

421
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,680
我觉得他有外遇了
I think he was having an affair.

422
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,420
我说对了  是吗
I'm right, aren't I?

423
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,840
我们在你丈夫衣服上找到了一个女人的DNA
We found a woman's DNA on your husband's clothing.

424
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,670
大约一个月前  他有没有
Was he gone for an extended period of time

425
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,860
消失过一段时间
about a month ago?

426
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,050
这种事情持续了将近一年
This has been going on for almost a year.

427
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,690
你应该能理解我们需要你的DNA
You understand that we'll need to rule you out

428
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,460
来将你排除吧
as a source of that DNA?

429
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,200
当然  没问题
Yeah, of course.

430
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,870
尽你们所需
Whatever you guys need.

431
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,440
我在我丈夫车里发现了另一部手机
I found a second phone in my husband's car.

432
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,290
应该叫一次性手机
I believe they're called "Burn" Phones.

433
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,710
我记下了号码
I wrote the number down.

434
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,480
也许会有帮助
Maybe that'll help.

435
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,870
谢谢
Thank you.

436
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,840
弗罗斯特警探你在想什么
What were you thinking detective Frost.

437
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,310
我没在想什么  长官
I wasn't thinking, sir.

438
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,510
你肯定没有
You sure as hell weren't.

439
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,810
对不起  长官
I'm sorry, sir.

440
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,100
这是怎么回事
What was that all about?

441
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,700
我泡了榛子咖啡
I made hazelnut coffee.

442
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,400
显然  他不喜欢榛子
Apparently, he doesn't like hazelnut.

443
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,540
老天
Oh, boy.

444
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,350
卡瓦诺夫为什么心情如此不好
Why is cavanaugh in such a lousy mood?

445
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,410
因为他和我妈分手了
'cause he broke up with my mother.

446
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,290
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding me.

447
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,330
你看起来不那么惊讶啊
You don't look too surprised.

448
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,680
你妈向我倾诉了一切
Uh... your mother confided in me,

449
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,960
让我什么都别说
and asked me not to say anything.

450
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,540
很高兴她能找你倾诉  她真的很受伤
Well, good. I'm glad she had you to talk to. She was really hurt.

451
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,090
我觉得她仍然喜欢他
I think she still likes him.

452
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,460
你怎么想的
How do you feel about that?

453
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,590
现在是给爱管闲事夫人树立榜样的时候了
Like it's time to set a good example for Mrs. Buttinsky

454
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,300
不要成为爱管闲事的警探
and not be detectibuttinsky.

455
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,560
查下这个号码  这是受害人的一次性手机
Run this number, will you? It's our victim's burn phone.

456
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,890
我觉得妻子是清白的
Wife seems clean to me.

457
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,580
我也觉得
Me too.

458
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,350
我猜格雷格不用这个手机
I'm guessing ol' Greg wasn't calling home

459
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,620
打给家里
on that second phone.

460
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,420
是这样
Yeah, he was.

461
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,850
不给他本来的家打
But not the family home.

462
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,110
我们的死者为两个地址设了不同电话
Our boy had two phones for two addresses.

463
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,190
他用他的秘密手机
He was using his secret batphone

464
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,320
打给
to call...

465
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,440
他一年前买的后湾公寓
a back bay condo he bought a year ago.

466
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,030
我觉得他不仅背着妻子偷情
I'm thinking not only was he cheating on his wife,

467
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,670
还有了小爱巢
he had a little love nest.

468
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,210
咱们去查查
Let's go toss it.

469
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,310
波士顿警察  开门
Boston police! Open the door!

470
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:46,970
安全
Clear.

471
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,780
我觉得所有的喊叫声都是游里的戏
I think all that yelling is just this game.

472
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,160
安全
Clear.

473
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,330
无骨奥拉夫
Olaf the boneless.

474
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,320
和扎死他的矛尖
That's the same name

475
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,030
上写的名字一样
that was on the spear tip that killed him.

476
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,310
一定是扬森的用户名
Must be Jensen's user name.

477
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,160
他喜欢玩游戏
Man. He liked playing.

478
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,670
他至今在线2738个小时
He's logged 2,738 hours.

479
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,400
他也有一些高级武器
He has some high-level weapons, too --

480
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,290
波杰尔斧  托尔锤  
Porgeir's ax, thor's hammer.

481
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,330
和一个萨迦盾
And a saga shield?

482
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,500
我靠
Damn!

483
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,630
你懂得真多啊  弗罗斯特  
You seem to know a lot about this, Frost.

484
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,840
我玩过多人在线网络对战游戏
I've dabbled in M.M.O.R.P.G.

485
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,980
你玩过
Have you?

486
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,800
很多人一起在线玩角色扮演游戏
Massive multiplayer online role-playing games.

487
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,390
这个游戏叫维京王国
This one's called "Vikings of the realm."

488
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,560
你为什么会浪费2700个小时玩电脑游戏
Why would you waste 2,700 hours playing a computer game?

489
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,510
为了荣耀
Points.

490
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,520
什么荣耀
Points for what?

491
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,730
赢
To win!

492
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,510
赢什么
Win what?!

493
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,820
好吧  那么  格雷格・扬森 
Okay, so...Greg Jensen

494
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,970
经营一家成功的现酿啤酒厂
ran a successful microbrewing company,

495
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,020
但他大部分时间在扮演无骨奥拉夫
but he pretended to be "Olaf the boneless" most of the time.

496
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,100
看看这个
Look at this --

497
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:48,010
上个月寄到受害者信箱的信 
Snail mail, addressed to the victim at a P.O. Box, sent within the last month.

498
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,610
没有回信地址  不认识
No return address. Can't read it.

499
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,200
看来像符文写的
Looks like it's written in rune.

500
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,810
看这个
Hey, look at this.

501
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,080
下一个就是你的妓女
"Your whore is next."

502
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,680
凶手可能还没有停手
I'm thinking our killer isn't done.

503
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,880
如果我们要了同一个口味
I'm just saying it's more cost-effective

504
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,550
那要一夸脱冻酸奶更合算
to get a quart of frozen yogurt if we're sharing the same flavors.

505
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,370
我喜欢我自己的
I like my own, okay?

506
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,190
你为什么不喜欢搅拌呢
Well, why don't you like it swirled?

507
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,700
还是摩卡和薄荷味
It's still mocha and mint.

508
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,410
不  一搅拌就成一种味道了
No. When you swirl it, it becomes one flavor.

509
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,720
咖啡牙膏味
Coffee toothpaste.

510
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,680
别把你的香肠油滴到我这半
Don't get your pepperoni grease on my half.

511
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,040
好吧  把你的香菇从我这半拿走
Okay, get your mushroom off my half.

512
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,870
你和你妈聊过吗
Did you talk to your mother?

513
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,770
我们离开的时候卡瓦诺夫中尉很痛苦
Lieutenant Cavanaugh looked miserable when we left.

514
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,200
也许是因为我们有一个凶手躲在
Well, maybe because we have an unsolved homicide

515
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,880
游戏里的凶杀案还没破
with a killer hiding in a video game.

516
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,530
是谁
Who's that?

517
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,810
不是吧  一个淡紫色大众汽车窃听器  
He did not! A lavender vw bug?

518
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,040
我对天发誓  淡紫色  一个人
God's honest truth -- lavender, for a guy who's...

519
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,660
你能感受到我吗
You feel me?

520
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,590
谁要感受你  吉布森警探  
Who's gonna feel you, detective Gibson?

521
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,440
里佐利警探
Detective Rizzoli.

522
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,290
你好吗
How are you?

523
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,980
我只是顺道送你妈
Uh...I was just dropping your mother off.

524
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,490
经你允许了吗
Did you permit this?

525
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,190
我确定当他们在你妈床上爱爱的时候
Well, I insisted they each have one foot on the floor

526
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,620
各有一只脚在地板上
when there's heavy petting on your mother's bed.

527
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,790
真好笑
You're so funny.

528
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,870
妈  我能跟你聊一会儿吗
Uh, ma, can I talk to you for a sec?

529
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,650
好...好的
Uh...s-sure.

530
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,930
我先上楼了
Oh, hey, I'm just gonna go upstairs.

531
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,150
我好像忘记给我的电动牙刷充电了
I think I forgot to charge my electric toothbrush.

532
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,420
好了  你为什么这么对卡瓦诺夫警督
Okay, why are you doing this to Lieutenant Cavanaugh?

533
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,740
简  这跟你一点关系都没有
Okay, Jane, this is so not your business.

534
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,200
关系大着呢
Yeah, it is.

535
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,850
特别是现在他把火全撒在我们身上
Especially when he's taking it out on all of us.

536
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,880
整个警队呢
The -- the entire squad.

537
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,040
那只能说明他比我想的幼稚多了
Well, then he's more juvenile than I thought he was.

538
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,520
你想听听什么叫幼稚
You want to hear juvenile?

539
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,880
"你要是辆车  肯定是辆68年的道奇战马"
"If you were a car, you'd be a '68 Dodge Charger."

540
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,920
你根本都不喜欢那个傻瓜
You don't even like that goofball.

541
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,720
别这么叫他
Don't call him that.

542
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,070
而且我喜欢他
And I do, too!

543
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,210
我才不信
I don't believe you.

544
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,970
如果你这么做只是为了让卡瓦诺夫吃醋
And if you are doing this just to get to Cavanaugh,

545
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,770
那我会告诉你你跟我说过的话
then I'm gonna say the same thing you told me.

546
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,560
别这样  这不合你的身份
Don't. It's beneath you.

547
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,290
简
Jane.

548
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,850
妈  你是在哭吗
Wh-- ma? A-are you crying?

549
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,860
我太为你骄傲了
I'm so proud of you.

550
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,520
你哭个什么呀
W-w-why are you crying?

551
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,410
因为我把你养大  你出落成漂亮的大姑娘
Because I raised you -- I raised a beautiful girl.

552
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,590
而且
And...

553
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,350
你说的对
...you're right.

554
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,810
谢谢
Thank you.

555
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,230
我爱你  妈
I love you, ma.

556
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,550
我也爱你
I love you more.

557
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,240
谢谢  美人
Thanks, gorgeous.

558
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,330
警探
Detective.

559
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,070
这是个好兆头
That's a good sign.

560
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,160
起码她没再让人注意她的嘴了
At least she's not drawing attention to her mouth.

561
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,690
没有调情的迹象
No sign of flirtation.

562
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,980
保时捷惨败了  我需要一杯提神酒
I needed a pick-me-up after that porsche fiasco.

563
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,360
你听说这事了吗  里佐利
You hear about this, Rizzoli?

564
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,840
大家都在说这事呢
Everybody's talking about it.

565
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,980
是啊  大家都在说破烂的"保时吉"  吉布森
Oh, yeah, everyone's talking about that old "Porsh," Gibson.

566
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,120
是"保时捷"
It's "Porsh-ah."

567
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,890
是吗
Really?

568
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,910
吉布森是意大利名吗
"Gibson" is an italian name?

569
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,700
不是
No.

570
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,160
不过咱们中有人对意大利高级车如数家珍
But some of us know a lot about high-end Italian rides.

571
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,470
那是德国车  你这傻子
It's a German car, you idiot.

572
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,970
我觉得他们俩是在拆裆
I think they're crotch-blocking each other.

573
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,660
"拆档"  你搞笑吧
"Crotch-blocking"? Really?

574
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,810
是我那个教北欧历史的老教授
It's my old nordic-history professor.

575
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,290
他办公室的人说他就快到了
His office says he's almost here.

576
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,720
小香草太太
Mrs. Vanilla.

577
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,550
我们找到你的钱包了
We found your wallet!

578
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,560
朗多  谢谢
Rondo, thank you!

579
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,280
你是在哪里找到的  朗多
Oh! Where'd you find it, Rondo?

580
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,860
我知道不会是你们拿的
I knew you guys didn't take it.

581
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,070
我们去翻了垃圾  丹尼亚在一个垃圾箱里找到的
Well, we checked the trash. Dania found it in a dumpster.

582
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,620
没丢东西吧  妈
Is everything there, ma?

583
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,470
我看看  驾照  银行卡  现金
Well, my license, my ATM card, my cash --

584
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,900
少了一百块
I'm missing 100 bucks.

585
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,620
你确定吗  小香草太太
Are you sure, Mrs. Vanilla?

586
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,010
好了  道格  走吧  我们去楼上备案
Okay, Dawg, let's go. We're going upstairs to booking.

587
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,730
不  简  等等  我来处理这事
No, Jane, wait. Let me handle this.

588
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,970
你妈妈会怎么想
How would your mother feel?

589
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,920
她不会很为你骄傲了吧
She wouldn't be very proud, would she?

590
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,150
道格没有母亲
Um... Dawg doesn't have a mother.

591
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,790
他母亲去世了
His mother passed.

592
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,630
我  我真抱歉
Oh, I'm -- I'm sor--

593
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,770
别哭
Don't cry.

594
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,100
坚强点  没事
Don't cry. All right.

595
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
不是他干的
He didn't do it.

596
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,200
他是在替我顶罪
He's covering for me.

597
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,350
钱我没用  我这就还给你
The money's there. I put it back.

598
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,510
丹尼亚  你为什么偷我的钱
Dania, why would you steal from me?

599
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,250
我需要一百块买课本
I needed $100 for a textbook.

600
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,220
那你怎么不跟老师说呢
Well, why didn't you tell the teacher?

601
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,870
我不想让她知道...
I didn't want her to know --

602
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,650
知道什么
What?

603
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,080
知道你住在青少年收容所
that -- that you live in a teen shelter?

604
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,740
对
Yeah.

605
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,840
你去了洗手间
You went to the bathroom.

606
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,010
我就从你包里拿走了钱包
I took the wallet out of your purse.

607
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,590
道格看到你回来
Dawg saw you coming,

608
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,890
就拉响了警报掩护我
and he pulled the alarm to cover for me.

609
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,320
我真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

610
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,610
我也很抱歉
I'm sorry, too.

611
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,620
简
Jane.

612
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,080
这是波士顿剑桥大学
This is professor Walter Lowell

613
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,940
北欧研究学院的
from the Department of Scandinavian Studies

614
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,380

Hello. It's nice to meet you.

616
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,540
这是我的荣幸
The pleasure is mine.

617
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,730
艾尔斯医生正要给我看些
Dr. Isles was about to show me some letters

618
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,310
你们想让我翻译的
written in the rune alphabet

619
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,310
古代北欧文写的书信
that you all would like me to translate.

620
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,700
对  信在这里
Yes. I have some of the letters here.

621
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,030
我们把原版复印过了
We made copies of the originals.

622
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,380
软盘
Oh, floppy disks?

623
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,780
我当然还记得
Oh, yes, I certainly do remember

624
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,390
软盘是原版的那个年代
when the floppies were the originals.

625
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,560
之前你说"老"的时候  我真没想到
When you said "old," I didn't realize

626
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,150
你是指他曾跟奥拉夫一起当过海盗
that you meant he and Olaf went on Viking raids together.

627
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,210
他耳朵不好使  但他会读唇语
He's hard of hearing, but he can read lips.

628
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,880
这些看上去像是用原始诺尔斯语写的
These appear to be written in proto-norse.

629
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,280
那是种在北欧使用的印欧语
That's an Indo-European language spoken in Scandinavia.

630
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,530
人们认为它在
It's thought to have evolved

631
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,650
公元一世纪后发展成了一种原始的
as a Proto-Germanic Northern dialect

632
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,270
德国北部方言
over the 1st century A.D..

633
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,890
行行好  一个书呆子讲话就够了
Please -- one nerd at a time.

634
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,360
这些是情书
Well, these are love letters

635
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,600
写给一位名叫无骨奥拉夫的维京人
addressed to a viking by the name of Olaf the Boneless.

636
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,630
可那在  那在历史上是错的
No, that's -- that's historically incorrect.

637
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:07,010
应该是无骨伊娃
It's Ivar the Boneless.

638
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,630
希望他不是以小时收费的
I hope he's not charging us by the hour.

639
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,190
别说了
Stop.

640
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,180
这些信是奥拉夫的情人
They were written by Olaf's lover,

641
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,820
一个叫古娜希尔德的维京女人写的
a viking maiden by the name of Gunnhild.

642
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,680
我的天呐
Oh, dear.

643
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,960
奥拉夫还跟另一个叫温特玛特的维京女人
Olaf was still married to a different viking maiden

644
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,970
结了婚呢
by the name of Undirmaor.

645
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,470
知道吗  温特玛特的意思是...
You know, "undirmaor" means --

646
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,970
不是时候  莫拉
Not now, Maura.

647
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,300
他到底是有多迷这个游戏啊
Exactly how deep into this game was he?

648
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,150
听听这个
Listen to this.

649
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,830
"你天鹅绒般柔软的胡须仍在
"Your velvety beard still hums

650
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:45,580
我温软的胸脯上低吟"
against the bosom of my tender flesh."

651
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,100
好的  非常感谢你的帮助
Okay. Well, uh, you've been very helpful.

652
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,820
矛上发现的DNA跟
The DNA recovered from the spear is a match

653
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,570
死者身上找到的DNA吻合
for the DNA found on the victim.

654
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,780
是来自于同一个女人
It's from the same woman.

655
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,650

Thank you, Susie.

656
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,070

00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,760
的确很冷
Cold, indeed.

666
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,720
在受害人电脑上发现什么了吗
Find anything on the victim's computer?

667
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,820
没什么有用的  他只用电脑来玩网游
Nothing useful. He jus used it to play M.M.O.S

668
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,840
真搞不懂他的生意是怎么成功的
No idea how he had a successful business.

669

我猜和一群维京人玩游戏

被唠叨的教授困住了

00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,950
我要从头开始
And I got to go back to the beginning.

756
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:42,740
糟了
Oh, crap.

757
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,530
迪小姐  肯德拉
Mrs. D! Kendra!

758
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,920
请求支援  我们要封锁这里
Call for backup. We got to lock this place down.

759
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,490
你 说你呢
Hey, you. You! Hey!

760
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,380
我需要索利漫画店区域的所有单位来支援
I need all units in the area at solly's comic store.

761
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,630
你看见有人进去过吗
Did you see anyone come in here?

762
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,440
没有  先生  是女士  女士
Uh, no, sir. Ma'am. Ma'am.

763
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,040
要确保任何人都不能出去  可以吗
Make sure nobody leaves this store, all right?

764
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,030
快去
Go on!

765
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,360
她被短剑刺死
She was stabbed with a dagger --

766
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,850
和游戏里一样
Just like in the game.

767
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,230
温特玛特到底是谁
Who the hell is undirmaor?

768
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,690
她就是凶手
Because that's our killer.

769
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,820
说你有线索
Tell me you have something

770
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,700
因为没找到目击者
'cause we don't have a single witness.,

771
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,850
我在肯德拉的外衣上找到一丝头发  没有发根
Well, I found a hair on Kendra's cloak. No root ball.

772
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,590
但是我们在用一种新的法医激光技术
But we are trying a new forensic laser technique.

773
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,960
运用紫外线和质谱分析法
It uses ultraviolet light and mass spectrometry.

774
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,610
请快进
Faster, please.

775
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,390
击中头发  把它变成气体
Zaps the hair and turns it into a gas.

776
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,530
这和两起凶案又有什么联系
Explain how that's gonna help me solve two murders.

777
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,640
它可以查明凶手在过去一年里
It may help us determine what the killer ate and drank

778
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,600
都吃喝了什么
over the last year.

779
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,020
知道凶手吃了什么怎么就有帮助了呢
How is knowing how many ding dongs our suspect ate helpful?

780
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,400
头发质谱分析法的结果出来了
The mass spectrometer results are back on the hair tests.

781
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,470
我知道你在等
I know you've been waiting for them.

782
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,420
谢谢
Thank you.

783
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,010
因为头发长得很慢
Because hair grows slowly over time,

784
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,270
它会建立一种时间线
It creates a timeline of sorts.

785
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,620
好吧
Okay.

786
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,020
那凶手在四月的早餐
So, what did the killer eat --

787
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,780
我看看
Uh, let me see --

788
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,940
都吃了什么
for breakfast in April?

789
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,160
有意思
That's interesting.

790
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,730
的确
It certainly is.

791
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,190
草莓华夫饼  鸡蛋松饼
Strawberry waffles? Eggs benedict?

792
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,990
什么嘛
What?

793
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,870
发酵须鲸和羊头芝士
Fermented minke whale and sheep's head cheese.

794
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,300
假设一个人想要吃发酵须鲸
Where would you get minke whale

795
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,420
和羊头芝士的话
and sheep's head cheese,

796
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,550
要去哪里才能买得到
assuming you'd want it?

797
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,430
斯堪的纳维亚
Um...Scandinavia?

798
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,310
斯堪的纳维亚
Scandinavia.

799
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,880
莫拉  "温特玛特"是什么意思
Maura, what does "Undirmaor" mean?

800
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,950
英语里吗
In English?

801
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,450
不是  是在霍比特语里
No. In Proto-hobbit.

802
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,610
当然是在英语里啦
Yes, in English!

803
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,650
下属或是学徒
"Underling" or "apprentice".

804
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,620
学徒
Apprentice.

805
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,110
或是助手
Or assistant.

806
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,550
莫拉  我们认识一个
Maura, we know someone

807
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,270
可能一直在吃鲸鱼或是羊的人
who's probably been eating whale or sheep.

808
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,040
拿到证明了  她的不在场证明纯属瞎编
Got a warrant. Alibi was bullshit.

809
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,380
航空公司刚刚证实了
The airline just confirmed.

810
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,050
罗比・伯克  格雷格・扬森的助理
Ruby Burke, Greg Jensen's assistant,

811
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,920
用剩余机票搭乘了早一班航班从雷克雅末克飞了回来
flew standby on an earlier flight from Reykjavik.

812
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,480
干得好  弗罗斯特
Nice, Frost.

813
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,700
好的  谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

814
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,950
罗比今天没去上班
Ruby didn't show up to work today.

815
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,820
她正在某处玩"维京王国"呢
She's playing "Vikings of the Realm" somewhere.

816
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,520
难不成我要在游戏里发通缉令吗
So I put a bolo out in the realm?

817
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,850
不用  我建了个游戏人物来找她
No. I built an avatar to find her.

818
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,630
长得跟你真像呀
Looks just like you.

819
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,670
我们得伪装一下嘛
We got to go in disguise.

820
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,250
我还是不明白这个白痴游戏有什么好玩的
I still don't understand the point of this stupid game.

821
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,990
有什么好难理解的
Well, what is so hard about it?

822
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,160
无非就是袭击几艘船  抢夺村庄
You raid ships, plunder villages,

823
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,550
杀几个敌兵就赢了
kill sworn enemies to win.

824
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,650
能赢来什么  虚拟情人吗
Win what? A fantasy lover?

825
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,730
等一下
Wait a minute.

826
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,380
我觉得这和输赢无关
I don't think this is about winning.

827
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,850
我认为动机是爱情
I think this is about love.

828
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,220
你认为格雷格・样色和罗比在现实中有外遇
You think Greg Jensen was having a real affair with Ruby?

829
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,440
我说不准  也许不算是外遇吧
I don't know. It wasn't much of an affair.

830
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,390
没有证据显示她曾出现在他的爱巢中
There wasn't any evidence of her at his love nest,

831
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,230
而且我们发现的分泌物和精液残留
and the secretions and the seminal fluid

832
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,230
也都有一个月之久了
that we found were a month old.

833
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,140
除非扬森是因为可怜她而跟她上床
Unless Jensen had pity sex.

834
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,460
可怜她
Pity sex?

835
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,870
是呀  就那么一次
Yeah, one-time pity sex,

836
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,950
然后他就把她扔去了斯堪的纳维亚
right before he sent Ruby to Scandinavia.

837
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,200
他冷淡了她
I mean, he froze her out --

838
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,470
不管是现实生活中还是在游戏中
in real life and in the game, too.

839
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,510
所以罗比肯定在游戏中跟踪他
So, Ruby must have stalked him in the game,

840
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,680
发现他找了个新的虚拟情人
figured out that he had a new virtual lover...

841
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,480
古娜希尔德也就是肯德拉・迪
"Gunnhild", a.k.a Kendra Dee.

842
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,000
弗罗斯特
Frost...

843
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,380
看看奥拉夫是否在线
check and see if Olaf is online.

844
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,620
奥拉夫  但是格雷格・扬森在现实中已经死了
Olaf? But Greg Jensen is dead in the I.R.L.

845
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,590
那你怎么解释奥拉夫仍在自己的爱巢中登陆游戏呢
So explain why Olaf is online in his Back Bay love nest.

846
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,360
不是奥拉夫  而是温特玛特
Not Olaf -- Undirmaor.

847
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,220
罗比  把手举起来
Ruby, put your hands in the air.

848
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,880
奥拉夫  我的挚爱
Olaf, my love.

849
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,990
温特玛特  你终于来了
Undirmaor. At last -- you're here.

850
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:25,800
罗
Ru --

851
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,170
她根本都不知道咱们的存在
She doesn't even know we're here.

852
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,590
科萨克  把那东西拔了
Korsak, unplug that thing.

853
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,090
不
No.

854
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,830
不  奥拉夫
No! Olaf!

855
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,930
奥拉夫  求求你  回来呀  我的挚爱
Olaf, please come back, my love.

856
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,650
罗比  一切都结束了
Ruby, it's over.

857
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,080
没有
It's not over.

858
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,130
我们终于在一起了
We were finally together.

859
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,370
开机呀
Turn it on.

860
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,790
把他带回来
Bring him back.

861
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,850
他回不来了
He's not coming back.

862
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,290
格雷格已经死了  罗比
Greg is dead, Ruby.

863
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,940
我爱他
I loved him.

864
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,400
他也爱我
He loved me.

865
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,340
他到底是爱罗比・伯克还是温特玛特呢
Did he love Ruby Burke, or did he love Undirmaor?

866
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,480
他爱我
He loved me.

867
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,960
我
Me.

868
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,090
奥拉夫爱温特玛特  我以为
Olaf loved Undirmaor, and I thought...

869
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,130
天啊  如果他要是知道温特玛特就是我的话
Oh, God, if only, if only he knew that it was me --

870
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,130
就是我  就是罗比  一直在他身边
Me, Ruby, right there all along...

871
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,110
你向他表明身份到底是在你们一个月前上床之前
Did you tell him who you were before or after

872
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,840
还是在那之后
you slept with him a month ago?

873
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,170
我把我的身体献给了他
I gave him my flesh.

874
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,470
可当我告诉他我就是温特玛特的时候  他
And when I told him I was Undirmaor, he just...

875
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,110
他把我派走了
He sent me away.

876
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,090
罗比  你因谋杀格雷格・扬森而被捕了
Ruby, you're under arrest for the murder of Greg Jensen.

877
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,930
不  不  求求你们把游戏打开吧
No! No! Please turn it back on!

878
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:46,630
还有谋杀肯德拉・迪
And Kendra Dee.

879
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,310
不  不  他没有死
No! No, he's not gone!

880
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,730
不  他没有死
No, he's not gone!

881
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,820
不会的
He can't be!

882
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,060
他不会死的
He can't be gone!

883
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,570
蹲监狱
Aah! Go right to jail!

884
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,370
到我了  我要买地产
My turn. I want to buy me some property.

885
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,270
希望你把你的上好餐具都藏起来了
Hope you hid the good silver.

886
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,640
你装得一副冷酷的样子
You pretend to be such a badass,

887
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,210
但你实际上很心软
but you're really a pushover.

888
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,300
我很开心你邀请了他们过来
I'm glad you brought them here.

889
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,190
怎么着  方便你研究异常青春期行为
Why? So you could study aberrant juvenile behavior?

890
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,310
他们只是需要别人的注意和一点点支持
They just need some attention, a little support.

891
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,910
他们从来都没玩过桌游
I mean, they've never played a board game.

892
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,330
太难以置信了
Can you believe that?

893
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,710
就是啊
I know.

894
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,840
莫拉  你在这面包里放了多少大蒜呀
Maura, how much garlic did you put on this bread?

895
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,760
-六瓣  -六
- Six cloves. - Six cl--

896
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,010
他们是无家可归的孩子而已  又不是吸血鬼
They're homeless teenagers. They're not vampires.

897
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,400
丹尼亚怎么办
What about Dania?

898
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,880
我会盯着她的
Well, I'm gonna keep an eye on her.

899
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
你也是
and so were you.

900
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,140
我们会确保她把她的聪明才智用到正事上
We'll make sure she puts that big brain to good use.

901
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,770
我和卡瓦诺夫谈了  
I talked to Cavanaugh.

902
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,170
导师项目成为正式的了
The mentor program is now official.

903
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,410
我想要停车的地方
I wanted park place!

904
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,190
不好意思了  小香草太太
Oh, too bad,, Mrs. Vanilla.

905
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,690
-小香草  -干吗
