1
00:00:02,661 --> 00:00:04,074
你一会儿能帮我熨下我的制服吗?
Hey, will you steam my uniform next?

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:05,047
额
Yeah

3
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:06,330
有意思
Interesting.

4
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:07,948
还记得当初我问你
Do you recall this coversation?

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,301
Leonard  想要AA制买个熨斗吗?
"Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer?"

6
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:13,504
不  Sheldon  我们不需要熨斗
"No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer."

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,891
你这是自取其辱
Looks like that rumpled chicken's come home to roost.

8
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:19,126
Hi
Hi.

9
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:20,645
这是你要的化妆棉
Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.

10
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:22,914
谢谢  我以为我还有很多
Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.

11
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,686
坑爹呢  你的化妆品比我还多
Damn, you've got more makeup than I do.

12
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:31,606
质量还比我的好
You've got better makeup than I do.

13
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:33,524
我要借你这个
Yeah, I'm borrowing this.

14
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:34,609
哎哎哎
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

15
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:35,976
这是我参加动漫大会用的化妆品
This is my Comic-Con makeup.

16
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:38,196
我爱你  但是有些东西
I love you, but there are some things

17
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:40,081
一个男人是不能和他女朋友分享的
a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.

18
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,334
这个想法太明智了
That's a wise policy.

19
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:44,985
我曾借过我姐的化妆品
I once borrowed my sister's makeup

20
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:46,170
为参加一个化妆比赛
for a costume contest.

21
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:47,788
最后得了严重的红眼病
Got a terrible case of pinkeye.

22
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,790
幸运的是  我本就打算扮成僵尸
Yeah, but luckily, I was going as a zombie.

23
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,676
最后我得了第二名
I won second place.

24
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:54,795
我觉得你们才去了动漫大会啊
I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.

25
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:55,829
那是圣地亚哥动漫节大会
That was San Diego Comic-Con.

26
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,965
这次是Bakersfield动漫大会
This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.

27
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:59,634
这个更好吗?
Is that better?

28
00:00:59,636 --> 00:01:00,935
这个规模小很多
Well, it's a lot smaller.

29
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:02,019
活动主要是关于漫画书的
It's more about the comic books.

30
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,521
原来的动漫大会就是这样
The way these conventions used to be

31
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:05,356
现在一个个弄得跟好莱坞电影节似的
before they went all Hollywood.

32
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,309
所以回答你的问题  不  它没有更好
So to answer your question, no, it's not better.

33
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,728
那你们干嘛要去?
Well, then why are you going?

34
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,630
这是有关漫画书的集体活动
It's a comic book convention.

35
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:14,982
就像匹萨或者粒子加速器
You know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators,

36
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:17,485
即使不太好的  也非常棒
even the stinky one's still pretty good.

37
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:18,703
好吧
All right.

38
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:19,704
你们玩开心
Well, you guys have fun.

39
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:20,854
星期天晚上我就回来了
I guess I'll see you Sunday night.

40
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:22,022
恩恩
Yeah. Okay.

41
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:23,524
哦  等一下
Oh, hang on a second.

42
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:25,710
拿着这个
Hold this.

43
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,831
你要用来干嘛?
What was that for?

44
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,634
要是有人不相信我  我就给他们看照片
To show people when they don't believe me.

45
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,263
太棒了
Oh, this is the best.

46
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:07,098
周二早上豪饮
You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday,

47
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,149
你会有麻烦
you got a problem.

48
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:10,652
周末这么做的时候  就等于在吃早午餐
You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.

49
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:12,570
Sheldon不喜欢早午餐
Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch.

50
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:14,055
他不能忍
He can't stand being at a table

51
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:15,323
桌子上一个人吃着煎蛋卷
where one person's having an omelet

52
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,609
另一人却在吃三明治
and another person's having a sandwich.

53
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:20,945
他都不嫌累么
He's not exhausting at all.

54
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:24,032
Oh
Oh.

55
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,400
是Leonard
It's Leonard.

56
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:27,702
他说他们在去Bakersfield的路上
he says they're on the road and headed for Bakersfield

57
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:29,120
以非常"快"的速度
at "warp speed."

58
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:30,905
我可能是喝多了
Maybe it's the mimosa,

59
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:33,341
但我还是回个"好好笑"吧
but I'm gonna give the kid an LOL.

60
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:36,344
他们这么兴奋真是可爱
It's cute how excited they are.

61
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:37,545
你应该看看Howard
You should have seen Howard

62
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:39,347
为了这次大会他缝了一周制服
sewing his costume all week for the convention.

63
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,299
Howard什么时候学会缝东西了?
When did Howard learn to sew?

64
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:42,934
他小时候  每隔几个月
When he was a little boy, every couple months,

65
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:44,853
就得扔掉他妈妈的裤子
he would have to let his mom's pants out.

66
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:51,226
我完全不理解他们为什么要去参加这些
I don't even understand why they go to these conventions.

67
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:53,478
就是啊  他们四个在一个著名大学工作
I know. The four of them work at a major university.

68
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,479
人都非常聪明
They're all super smart.

69
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:55,730
怎么能这么沉迷于
How can they still be into something

70
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:57,232
这些12岁男孩的小玩意?
made for 12-year-olds?

71
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,566
我不介意
I don't mind it.

72
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:00,852
我觉得Howie是保持着内在的童心
I think Howie's just in touch with his inner child.

73
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:02,987
但当他穿着蝙蝠侠睡衣睡觉时
Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pajamas,

74
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,825
我有时觉得我都摸到了他内在的童心
sometimes it feels like I'm touching his inner child.

75
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:10,912
可能是因为他们小时候都被欺负过
It's probably because they were bullied growing up.

76
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:12,664
在一个他们无力还手的世界
In a world where you can't fight back,

77
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,216
超级英雄完成了他们的梦想
superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.

78
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,553
我有点过意不去了  我也欺负过别人
Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids.

79
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:20,004
但也不全是我的错
Although, in my defense,

80
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:22,390
如果Danny Biffle不想吃一嘴土
if Danny Biffle didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt,

81
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:26,311
他来上学就不要戴着领结嘛
he shouldn't have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.

82
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:28,680
我一本漫画都没看过  你们呢?
I've never even read a comic book. You guys?

83
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:29,814
-额  -没有
-Uh-uh.  -No.

84
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:30,849
我觉得漫画是他们生命中
I mean, it's such an important

85
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:31,816
很重要的一部分
part of their lives.

86
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:33,401
也许我们应该尝试读读
Maybe we should try reading some.

87
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:35,820
认真的?
Seriously?

88
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:38,239
漫画店就离咱们不远
The comic book store isn't far from here.

89
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:40,608
这想法太! 好! 了!
That is an amazing idea.

90
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,912
我喝了几杯了?
Okay, how many of these have I had?

91
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,618
我觉得你应该打开GPS
I think you should turn on the GPS.

92
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,253
它开着呢
It is on.

93
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:55,507
但是路线规划语音提示没有打开
But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on.

94
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,791
如果你打开路线规划语音提示的话
I know I'd feel more safe

95
00:03:56,793 --> 00:03:58,710
我会更有安全感
if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option.

96
00:03:58,712 --> 00:04:01,262
我爱路线规划语音提示
I love the turn-by-turn voice option.

97
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:05,500
我们真的只走了10英里吗?
Has it really only been ten miles?

98
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:08,136
我开  但是你得闭嘴
I'm turning it on, but just to shut you up.

99
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:13,024
Leonard  向左转 
Leonard, bear left and continue

100
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:15,310
沿着210公路一直开
on Interstate 210.

101
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:19,364
这家伙好懂行啊
Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he's talking about.

102
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:23,234
我要是你  我就好好听
I'd put on my listening ears if I were you.

103
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:24,852
你干了什么?
What did you do?

104
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:26,738
我在网上找到一个黑客
I found a hack online.

105
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,573
能帮忙把我录的MP3音频
I was able to upload MP3 recordings

106
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,825
上传到你的GPS上
of my voice to your GPS.

107
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:31,910
太酷了
That is so cool.

108
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:33,912
我反对  一点都不酷
Counterpoint, no, it's not.

109
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:36,581
继续在210号州际公路上
Continue on Interstate 210

110
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,082
行驶五英里
for five miles.

111
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:42,754
关于州际公路有个很有意思的事情哦
Here's an interesting fact about interstates.

112
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:44,756
是么?
Really?

113
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:47,258
嘘  他说了很有意思
Shh, he said it's interesting.

114
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,728
州际公路是根据以下规则编号的
Interstates are numbered as follows.

115
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,765
偶数号公路是东西向的
Even-numbered routes run east and west,

116
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,267
奇数号公路是
odd-numbered routes

117
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,269
南北向的
run north and south.

118
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:02,390
三位数的公路
Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses

119
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:05,527
表示是支线
or spurs.

120
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:08,413
看啊  Leonard  前面有座桥
Look, Leonard, there's a bridge.

121
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:09,747
我们冲下去吧
Drive off it.

122
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:13,618
我们离Vazquez Rocks不是很远
You know, we're not that far from Vazquez Rocks.

123
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,955
而且"星际迷航"有很多场景就是在那里拍的
Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.

124
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:19,123
我们这车上就有服装
We've got our costumes in the trunk.

125
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,709
我们去那里拍些照片吧
We could go there and have a little photo shoot.

126
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:23,094
好主意
Great idea.

127
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:25,463
我已经有两周没吃任何碳水化合物了
I haven't had a carbohydrate in two weeks.

128
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:27,715
我这性感的颧骨必须在我吃了椒盐卷饼
These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera

129
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:29,884
之前在照相机前留下倩影
before I eat a pretzel and they're gone.

130
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:31,970
好啊  听起来不错
Yeah, that sounds fun.

131
00:05:31,972 --> 00:05:33,221
哦  很赞哦
Oh, smashing.

132
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:35,923
但是  Leonard  你知道怎么过去吗?
Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?

133
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:36,523
不知道
No.

134
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:38,727
幸运的是  车里的某人认识路哦
Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.

135
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,528
路线重新规划中
Recalculating.

136
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,531
在我们等的时候
While we're waiting,

137
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,067
你们知道是哪位总统签署了
do you know which president signed

138
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:49,270
高速公路法案的吗?
the Intestate Highway System Act into law?

139
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:53,107
答案在14英里后公布
The answer, coming up in 14 miles.

140
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:55,994
你们肯定都不知道
None of you will get it.

141
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,162
是艾森豪威尔 (美国第三十四任总统)
It's Eisenhower.

142
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,177
为什么他们都盯着我们看?
Why are they staring?

143
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:15,513
谁在乎这个?
Who cares?

144
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:18,182
尽情享受吧
Just soak it in.

145
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:20,401
帅哥们  你们好啊
Hello, boys.

146
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:25,240
哦  嘿  
Oh, hey.

147
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,676
你们能不能别这么盯着了? 她们不就是女生嘛
Could you please stop staring? They're just girls.

148
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:32,413
和你们在电影或者图画里看到的没什么两样
It's nothing you haven't seen in movies or in drawings.

149
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:35,700
嘿  Stuart
Hey, Stuart.

150
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:36,701
什么风把你们给吹来了?
Wh-What brings you guys here?

151
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:38,152
我们想找些漫画看看
We were looking for a recommendation

152
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:39,504
你有什么好建议?
about comic books.

153
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:40,722
嗯  我建议你们不要
Oh, well, I recommend

154
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:42,957
开一个卖漫画书的店
you don't open a store and sell them.

155
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,275
其实我们只是想知道
No, we were just wondering

156
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:45,927
那些家伙们为什么对这些东西那么入迷
why the guys like this stuff so much,

157
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:47,629
所以我们也想看看
so we thought we'd give it a try.

158
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:49,714
好吧  你们对什么题材感兴趣?
Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into?

159
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,266
超级英雄  幻想类  漫画小说  日本漫画
Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga--

160
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:55,670
你再这样我用水管喷你了！
I swear I will turn a hose on you.

161
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:01,943
一般他们都喜欢什么类型的漫画?
What kind of comics do the guys like?

162
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:03,578
什么都有啊
Um, a litt bit of everything.

163
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,396
多数是关于超级英雄的
Mostly superhero stuff.

164
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:07,315
好吧  哪个是最厉害的超级英雄?
All right, well, who's the best superhero?

165
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:08,499
嘘!
Shh!

166
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:10,451
你在这里不能问这类的问题
You can't ask a question like that in here.

167
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:13,121
他们会争得打起来的
Are you trying to start a rumble?

168
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:15,990
好吧  你有什么推荐的?
Well, what do you recommend?

169
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:17,358
嗯  我想想
Well, uh, let's see.

170
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,294
有正义的超级英雄
You've got your basic clean-cut good guys--

171
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:21,079
超人  蜘蛛侠  美国队长
Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America.

172
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,982
也有带点黑暗色彩的
Then you have your darker anti-heroes

173
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:26,617
蝙蝠侠  金刚狼  惩罚者 
your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.

174
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:30,088
哦  坏孩子是我的菜
Ooh, I do love a bad boy.

175
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,975
所以你才找了位怕仓鼠的男朋友
As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.

176
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:38,763
我要是你的话  我会选Fables第一季(成人童话)
If I were you, I'd go for Fables number one.

177
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:40,214
这个作品很有深度
The artwork is sophisticated,

178
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:41,399
很有智慧
it's intelligently written,

179
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:43,401
而且不会没有把女性物质化  也没有对女性的成见
and it doesn't objectify or stereotype women.

180
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:44,602
喔哦  Thor!（北欧神话中的雷神）
Ooh, Thor!

181
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:47,238
他真性感
He's hot.

182
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,824
嗯  算是吧
Yeah, he kind of is.

183
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:56,497
上妆中
And we're blending,

184
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:58,366
上妆中
and we're blending,

185
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:00,251
搞定
and we're done.

186
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:06,457
我知道Data先生是不应该笑的
I know Mr. Data isn't supposed to smile,

187
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,043
但  我真心高兴啊
but here it comes.

188
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,715
过来  兄弟们
Come on, guys.

189
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:15,299
快来拍照
Let's do this.

190
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:18,603
是啊  我这秃头盖帽都快汗出翔了
Yeah, I'm sweating my bald cap off.

191
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:24,559
咱第一个pose该怎么摆?
So what's our first pose going to be?

192
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:27,395
我觉得我们得从星际迷航的经典打斗场景开拍
I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.

193
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,313
我来设倒计时
I'll set the timer.

194
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:36,704
Sheldon  你这算什么打斗姿势?
Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?

195
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:39,741
Data先生的武器就是他的大脑
Mr. Data's weapon is his mind.

196
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:41,376
我这是在操作呢
I'm wielding it.

197
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,452
打倒Borg!（Borg是W装扮的角色）
Phasers on the Borg!

198
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,723
霹雳娇娃
Charlie's Angels.

199
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:00,762
好的  下一个是什么?
Okay, what's next?

200
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:01,929
咱来拍几张
Now let's do

201
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:03,464
性感迷人魅惑的
some sexy glamour shots.

202
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,632
我来营造点气氛
I'll set the mood.

203
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,851
动次大次  动次大次  动次大次...
Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz...

204
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:10,521
动次大次  动次大次  动次大次...
oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz...

205
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:13,408
动次大次  动次大次  动次大次...
oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz.

206
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,576
好的  酷毙了
Yeah, nice one.

207
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,161
动次大次  动次大次 
Oontz, oontz, oontz.

208
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:18,863
就这样
That's right.

209
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:19,864
动次大次  动次大次 
Oontz, oontz, oontz.

210
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:22,450
我的天呐
Oh, my God.

211
00:09:22,452 --> 00:09:24,285
Leonard  有人把你车偷走了!
Leonard, someone's stealing your car!

212
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,487
什么? 嘿! 嘿!
What? Hey, hey!

213
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:28,122
回来! 快住手!
Come back here! Stop!

214
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:31,492
偷窃是犯法的!
Stealing is against the law!

215
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:34,545
真不敢相信
I don't believe this.

216
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:36,180
我了个去
Son of a bitch.

217
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:37,832
我来报警
I'll call 911.

218
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:38,933
额...
Wha...

219
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:41,135
我的手机在我另一条裤子里
Oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.

220
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:42,887
-我也是  -我也是
-Oh, so is mine. -Mine, too.

221
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,472
还有啥办法么
Anybody got any ideas?

222
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:45,890
没有
Nope.

223
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,559
那现在我们只能归咎一下各人责任了
The only thing left to do now is assign blame.

224
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:50,728
都怪你
Nice going.

225
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,274
谁会在光天化日之下
What kind of a person steals another person's car

226
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:03,742
偷别人的车啊?
in broad daylight?

227
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:06,328
谁会把车钥匙留在车里呢?
What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?

228
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,630
我们不是都同意这是Koothrappali的错吗? 
I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali's fault.

229
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:09,882
你说的对
You're right.

230
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:12,301
都怪你
Nice going.

231
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:14,119
有车来了
Car.

232
00:10:21,394 --> 00:10:22,544
大家都肿么了? 
What is wrong with people?

233
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:23,679
为什么没人停车? 
Why don't they stop?

234
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:25,147
没人停下或许是好事
Maybe we're better off.

235
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,933
万一我们上了疯子的车怎么办? 
What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?

236
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,601
Sheldon  看看我们吧
Look at us, Sheldon.

237
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:31,153
我们就是一群疯子
We're the crazy people.

238
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:36,441
或许我们应该举个牌子
Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign

239
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:40,662
告诉路过的司机我们没疯
that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.

240
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:42,614
好主意
Good idea.

241
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:44,917
你可以开始去弄了
Why don't you get started on that?

242
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:47,986
好了  我们就走走路吧
Come on, let's just start walking.

243
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:50,372
附近总会有加油站什么的吧
There's got to be a gas station or something nearby.

244
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:52,040
等下  你以为你穿的是队长的服装  
Wait, you think just because you're wearing

245
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:54,343
我们就都得听你的了么? 
a captain's uniform, you're in charge?

246
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:56,428
是啊
Yes.

247
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,413
好吧
All right.

248
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:11,393
好了  我看完了
Hmm, okay, I'm done.

249
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:13,362
你们怎么这么快就看完了? 
How did you guys finish so fast?

250
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:15,447
不知道  大概因为里面超多图片
I don't know, there were a lot of pictures,

251
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:19,568
而且有一页只有一个词 "降雷吧! "
and one page only had the word "brakkadoom!"

252
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,039
好吧  反正我的街头智慧很强大
Yeah, well, I have street smarts.

253
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,058
你们觉得漫画怎么样? 
So, what'd you guys think?

254
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,211
里面有很多动作
Well, there was a lot of action, Mmm.

255
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:31,496
故事情节轻快活泼
and the story moved along at a brisk pace.

256
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:33,415
总的来说...
It was, overall...

257
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,533
让我找个词来形容的话  就是...
what's the word I'm looking for?

258
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:37,169
-弱爆了?  -太弱了
-Stupid?  -So stupid.

259
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:39,304
我不明白为什么Leonard
I don't know how Leonard can get

260
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:40,422
那么喜欢漫画
so caught up in this.

261
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:41,723
太诡异了  他们能花好几小时
It's crazy; they spend hours

262
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:43,875
辩论这些根本不存在的东西
arguing about things that don't even exist.

263
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,510
真是浪费时间啊
What a waste of time. I know.

264
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:48,080
什么锤子能重到其他人都拿不起来呢? (漫画"雷神托尔"里雷神的武器)
A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?

265
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,733
我觉得不是因为它重
I don't think it's heavy.

266
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:54,937
而是魔法什么的  所以只有雷神能举起它
It's some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.

267
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:57,072
这个就更扯了
That makes even less sense, I mean...

268
00:11:57,074 --> 00:12:01,660
不  不  一点都不扯
No, no, no, it doesn't.

269
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:02,811
雷神是神
Thor is a god.

270
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,913
锤子是雷神的  只有他能使用它
The hammer is his; only he can use it.

271
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:08,083
就好像Sheldon和他的牙刷一样
It's like Sheldon and his toothbrush.

272
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:11,753
还有他那薄薄的诱人的嘴唇
Or his thin, beckoning lips.

273
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:15,540
等等  如果雷神的手正碰到锤子呢? 
Okay, hang on, what if Thor's hand is on the hammer?

274
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,709
我的意思是  如果他用他的神力碰了锤子
I mean, if he's touching it with his god magic,

275
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,244
那是不是我也可以把锤子举起来了?
does that mean I could lift it?

276
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:21,964
-不是  -是
-No. -Yes.

277
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:24,032
到底是还是不是?
Well, which is it?

278
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,435
或许我们漏掉了什么
Maybe we missed something.

279
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:27,552
我们再看一遍吧
Let's read it again.

280
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:29,821
好吧
Okay. Yeah.

281
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:36,528
你要喝点茶么? 
You want some tea?

282
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,529
好主意
Good idea.

283
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:39,481
我帮你一起泡茶
I'll help you.

284
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:41,316
等等  我们不是要看漫画么? 
Wait, I thought we were reading.

285
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:42,618
是啊
We are.

286
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,455
我们只是...让你先看一会儿
We're just, uh, giving you a head start.

287
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:57,633
我真希望我妈在这
I wish my mom was here.

288
00:12:57,635 --> 00:13:01,953
我们就可以都躲在她的影子里乘凉了
We could all hang out in her shadow.

289
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:04,139
穿着毛裤跋涉在沙漠中
Wool pants in the desert.

290
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:07,476
我觉得蛋蛋都要被煮熟了
I feel like I've got poached testicles.

291
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:10,646
可怜的孩纸
Oh, you poor thing;

292
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:12,114
你汗如雨下啊
you're sweating.

293
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:14,933
这总比车被偷好吧
That's so much worse than having your car stolen.

294
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:17,002
保险公司会赔给你钱买新车的
Insurance is gonna buy you a new car.

295
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,238
可没人给我的蛋蛋除汗臭
It's not gonna de-funk my junk.

296
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,407
童鞋们
Gentlemen,

297
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,192
表抱怨这么多
a little less bellyaching.

298
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:25,610
我们可是星舰战队的军官
We're Starfleet officers

299
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:27,746
博格集团的一员("星际迷航"里的高智慧团体)
and a member of the Borg Collective.

300
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:30,699
得了吧  Sheldon  我现在超没心情的
Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.

301
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:34,319
Leonard  我们一生都梦想着
Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed

302
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,587
能身处一个我们热爱的
of finding ourselves

303
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:38,423
幻想中的世界
inside one of the fantasy worlds we love.

304
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:40,509
看  我们现在
And look at us.

305
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,260
不就是
At this moment, we are, in fact,

306
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:44,429
一队星际迷航的先头登陆部队
a Star Trek landing party

307
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:48,066
在外星世界陷入了困境  忍受严酷的环境折磨
stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment,

308
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:50,936
只能依靠我们自身的智慧  坚韧
relying only on our wits, our fortitude

309
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:52,604
和勇气坚持下去
and our moxie.

310
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:55,006
只要我们还拥有这些力量
As long as we have those things,

311
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:57,342
-就没有人能阻止我们...  -呆子! 
-nothing can stop... -Nerds!

312
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:05,233
我恨这个星球
I hate this planet.

313
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:12,657
锤子上写着
It says right here on the hammer,

314
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,293
"无论谁握着这把锤子  只有配得上它的人
"Whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy,

315
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,079
才会拥有雷神的力量"
shall possess the power of Thor."

316
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:18,797
等等  谁来决定一个人是不是配得上呢? 
Hold on, who decides who's worthy?

317
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,165
锤子?
Does the hammer decide?

318
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,500
-是的  -不是
-Yes! -No!

319
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:24,669
锤子不能做决定的
It can't decide.

320
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:25,971
它是个锤子
It's a hammer.

321
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:27,539
可你说过它是个有魔力的锤子
You said it's a magic hammer.

322
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,424
是的  但是他还是不能做决定的
Yeah, it can't make decisions.

323
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:31,009
如果哈利波特的魔杖可以做决定
If Harry Potter's wand can make decisions,

324
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:32,644
为什么雷神的锤子不能做决定?
why can't Thor's hammer?

325
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:35,347
好吧  如果你要开始拿魔杖和锤子做比较的话
Okay, if you're going to start comparing wands and hammers,

326
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:38,934
我就没法和你认真说下去了
I can't even take you seriously.

327
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:58,370
大家好
Hello.

328
00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:00,789
大家好
Hello.


329
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:05,127
四杯水  谢谢
Uh, four glasses of water, please.

330
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:08,013
你们还要点什么不?
Anything for you guys?

331
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:10,515
能借用下你的电话吗?
Can I use your phone?

332
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:11,800
我们的车被偷了
Our car got stolen.

333
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:14,553
为什么不让Scotty把你传送出去?
(Beam me up Scotty: 星际迷航经典台词)
Why don't you ask Scotty to beam you up?

334
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:19,775
Scotty是第一部"星际迷航: 原初系列"里面的
Scotty was on the original series,

335
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:22,477
而我们是第二代
and we're Next Generation.

336
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:26,364
所以... 你们才好笑呢
So... joke's on you.

337
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:32,154
我们和他不是一起的
We're not with him.

338
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:38,210
在太空  你没法把东西拿"起来"
You can't pick something up in outer space.

339
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:40,579
那里就没有"起来"的概念
In space, there is no up.

340
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:44,115
哦是吗? 那为什么太阳每天都会升"起来"呢?
Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come "up" every day?

341
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:48,453
还真是辩不过你的街头智慧啊
Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.

342
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:55,560
Leonard和Sheldon在对门有整箱整箱的漫画
Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall.

343
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:56,845
为什么我们不找点看看?
Why don't we go look at those?

344
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:58,680
太棒了! 这就去! 看了你们就懂了
Oh, great! Yes! And then you will see.

345
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:01,233
我是对的  如果在太空的话
I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space,

346
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:03,018
人人都拿得动锤子
then anyone could pick up the hammer

347
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,452
因为在无重力环境中
because it would be floating around

348
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:05,737
锤子就自己飘在空中呢
in a weightless environment.

349
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:07,972
没错  笨鸟会用科学知识了
Yeah, that's right, the slow reader used science.

350
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:09,391
羡慕嫉妒恨去吧
Suck on that.

351
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:14,246
车上有什么贵重物品吗?
Was there anything valuable in the car?

352
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:17,115
我们的衣服  包包  手机
Our clothes, our wallets, phones.

353
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:18,750
还有大概价值300刀的化妆品
And about $300 worth of makeup,

354
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:22,070
所以现在小偷可能会伪装成任何人
so this thief could look like anyone right now.

355
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:24,256
化妆品?
Makeup?

356
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,491
嗯
Sure.

357
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:30,929
我们打算去参加Bakersfield的动漫大会
Uh, we're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield.

358
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:32,997
那有个大型cosplay大赛
They have a big costume contest.

359
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,268
说出来怎么就感觉不酷了
It's cooler than it sounds.

360
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,272
没有啊  我听着可酷了
I don't know, sounds pretty cool.

361
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,107
真的很酷
I-It is.

362
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:43,308
不仅仅是漫画书
It's not just comic books.

363
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,893
还有走来走去的卡通人物和玩偶
They've got action figures, toys,

364
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:46,611
还有电子争霸战主题的舞会...
a Tron-themed dance party...

365
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:48,230
够了够了  他知道有多酷了
Okay, he gets how cool it is.

366
00:16:49,282 --> 00:16:51,149
需要的信息我都记录好了
I think I have all I need here.

367
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:52,850
你们要给谁打个电话不?
You guys need me to call someone?

368
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:55,853
要不给你们老妈打个?
I'm guessing your moms?

369
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:59,641
谢了  我们自己能搞定
Thanks, but we've got it covered.

370
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,860
刚和我妈通了个电话
Okay, I just talked to my mom.

371
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,199
她给我们安排了一辆租车
She arranged for us to get a rental car.

372
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:09,367
太棒了
Great.

373
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,002
我们还来得及去动漫大会
We can still make it to Comic-Con.

374
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:12,304
开什么玩笑?
Are you kidding me?

375
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:14,506
折腾了这么久  我只想回家啊
After all we've been through, I just want to go home.

376
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:15,873
别介样嘛
Don't be like that.

377
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,225
Howard  你跟他说说
Come on, Howard, talk to him.

378
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:18,727
我赞同Leonard
I'm with Leonard.

379
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:20,712
我也不想玩了
I'm done.

380
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:23,398
好吧  那我们这是2比2
Fine, then I guess it's two against two.

381
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,766
那该怎么决定呢?
How do we decide?

382
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:28,687
其实  是3比1
Actually, it's three against one.

383
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:30,054
神马?!
What?!

384
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,189
那我们的使命怎么办?
What about the mission?

385
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:32,991
你说我们是真实版的先头登陆队啊
You said we were a real-life landing party.

386
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,809
但  我们不是啊
Yeah, well, we're not.

387
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,528
我们是意淫版的先锋登陆队
We're an imaginary landing party

388
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,080
路上被现实中的狗血洒满了头
who had real-life garbage thrown at us

389
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:41,833
还被现实中的路人当成了白痴
by real-life strangers who think we're idiots.

390
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,369
说句心里话
And to tell you the truth,

391
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:46,671
我开始觉得自己确实是个白痴了
I'm starting to feel like one.

392
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:49,240
我想回家了
I want to go home now.

393
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,543
好吧
Okay.

394
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:55,297
那我们可以从"企业租车公司"租辆车不?
Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise?

395
00:17:58,384 --> 00:18:00,352
明白不? "企业号" (暗示"星际迷航：企业号")
Get it? Enterprise?

396
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:04,255
我勒个去  明明很好笑
Screw you. That's funny.

397
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,810
如果绿巨人把雷神托尔举起来
Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor

398
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:10,762
而托尔又拿着一个锤子
while Thor is holding the hammer?

399
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:12,063
然后捏?
Yeah?

400
00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:13,264
那么根据物体的传递性质
Then by the transitive property

401
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:16,401
绿巨人就把锤子举起来啦
of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.

402
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:18,570
非也
No.

403
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:20,572
绿巨人是把雷神举起来  只有雷神是把锤子举起来
Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.

404
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:21,656
等等
Okay, hang on.

405
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:23,625
假设我去酒吧  泡了一个帅哥
If I go to a bar and pick up a guy,

406
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:25,744
而那个帅哥又泡了个美眉  之后我们一起走了
and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together,

407
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:27,779
请问我泡了这个美眉了吗?
did I pick up the girl?

408
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:34,619
真有此事吗?
Did that ever happen?

409
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:38,340
嘿  我们是在讨论我呢  还是在讨论雷神?
Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?

410
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:49,067
我们以后死也不出门了
Well, I say that's the last time we ever go outside.

411
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,352
你们听我说
Look, right here.

412
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:52,237
红巨人举起了雷神的锤子
Red Hulk is picking up Thor's hammer

413
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:53,688
因为雷神碰到锤子啦
'cause Thor's touching it.

414
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,157
不  因为他们是在太空
No, it's because they're in space.

415
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,642
他只碰到皮带好么
He's really just touching the strap.

416
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:59,811
皮带就是锤子的一部分!
The strap is part of the hammer!

417
00:18:59,813 --> 00:19:01,746
不是!
No, it's not!

418
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:04,816
他们真是在争论漫画情节吗?
Are they actually arguing about comic books?

419
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:06,334
不可能  这不科学
No, that can't be right.

420
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:08,203
说不定"雷神之锤"
Maybe "Thor's Hammer"

421
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:12,090
是指甲油的一种新颜色
is a new color of nail polish.

422
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,758
红巨人一定是值得举起锤子的人
Then Red Hulk must be worthy.

423
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
你怎么知道红巨人值得?
How could Red Hulk be worthy?

424
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:18,046
你又不认识他!
You don't know his life!

425
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,502
真相只有一个
There's only one logical explanation.

426
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:26,638
在沙漠的某个地方
Somewhere in the desert we crossed

427
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,973
我们穿越了...
into an alternate dimension...

428
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:30,341
在这个平行世界里 这些个女人
where the women in our lives

429
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:33,311
终于可以欣赏漫画书了
can finally appreciate great literature.

430
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:36,881
如果真有平行世界...
If it's an alternate dimension...

431
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:40,285
听起来是个先头登陆队的世界
sounds like a job for a landing party.

432
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:46,958
舰长  请指令!
Captain, what are your orders?

433
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,794
我们先搜查
I say we investigate.

434
00:19:53,532 --> 00:19:54,916
等等
Wait.

435
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,087
可能是敌人
They might be hostile.

436
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:03,040
好吧  但记得别打开
Fine, but set them to stun.

437
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:04,375
如果我们把Penny蒸发了
If we vaporize Penny,

438
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:06,344
我可再也找不到这么漂亮的女朋友了
I'll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.

439
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:20,393
趣事:
Fun fact:

440
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:24,880
艾森豪威尔总统在病房里
President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act

441
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:27,483
签署了联邦政府助建公路条例
from his hospital room.

442
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:30,629
哇  太有趣了
Wow, that is interesting.

443
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:35,083
每天都学新知识
You learn something new every day.

444
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:37,502
小测试: 请说出四个未通州际公路
Say, can you name the four state capitols

445
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:40,388
州议会大厦
that are not served by the interstate system?

446
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,042
哇  又一个测试  太棒了!
Ooh, another quiz. Yes!
