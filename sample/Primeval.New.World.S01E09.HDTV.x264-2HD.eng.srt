I'm doing okay.

Well, I think I can
stave off bankruptcy

Truth is, I'm not

That was always Ange.

26

Doing this without her
just feels weird.

She's not coming back,

to replace her?

Yeah, I'm getting resumes.

33

But anyone smart enough
to do that job

34
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:26,382
will be smart enough
to find out that

35
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,917
that old chem bunker
has been converted

No.

40
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:39,762
I'm giving it some time.

42
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:43,665
I don't know.

43
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,066
I mean, what am I
supposed to do?

44

Give him a call?

45
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:47,903
Leave him a voice mail

46
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,137
explaining that the real reason
we're friends

47
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:50,872
is that because
in some alternate reality,

48
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,174
he went back in time
and saved my life?

49
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:55,009
I think his frozen body
in the basement

50
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:57,813
is actually
the harder part to explain.

51
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,815
Do you know anything
about cost reports?

In West Van?

58
00:04:08,157 --> 00:04:10,825
Looks like the cost reports
will have to wait.

59
00:04:10,892 --> 00:04:13,926
Wait, how do you know
what kind of dinosaur?

60
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:17,531
[Toby]: Did you notice
the hit count?

61
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:19,867
When I first came upstairs,
it was under 9,000.

62
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:22,169
Now it's over 35,000.

63
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:23,918
That's a lot of eyeballs.

64
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:25,005
No chance it's a hoax?

65
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:26,773
No, I'm pretty plugged in

66
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:28,342
to the homebrew
animation community.

67
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:30,276
This isn't a fake.

68
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,278
This is
a "freakin' real dino."

69
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:33,145
And it was taken today?

70
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:34,280
A couple of hours ago.

71
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:35,982
I've got a sniffer running
on all dino stuff.

72
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:37,350
I caught it early.

73
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,352
So a few thousand people
click on a dinosaur video,

75
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:44,357
No one'll take it seriously.

76

some guy in Singapore

77
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:47,359

78
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:48,460
I'm worried about locals
recognizing that skate park

79
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:50,261
and going out there
to check it out.

80
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,564
Can you take this down?

81
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:54,366
Yeah, with a little effort.

82
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:55,700
I mean, I'm on it.

83
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:56,667
I'll grab the gear.

84
00:04:56,735 --> 00:04:58,436
Let's get out there.

85
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,139
What's the status
on the anomaly detector?

86
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:07,744
Oh, we're still 12 hours
away from operational.

87
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:09,846
Any way I can help?

88
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:12,081
No.

89
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,983
We'll be okay.

90
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:18,388
Once we're
in the general vicinity,

91
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:20,455
the handheld can get us
the rest of the way.

92
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:22,658
What about Mac?
Are we going to call him?

93
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:24,327
No.

94
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:25,961
Let's leave him alone.

95
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,266
Okay.

96
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:37,839

97
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:39,941
against a full-grown
triceratops.

98
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:43,477
This is bigger than anything
we've been up against before.

99
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,079
That's comforting.

100
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:46,414
It's a prey animal.

101
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:47,948
A herbivore.

102
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:50,151
There's a good case that
it'll just den down,

103
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:52,386
if it can find a safe spot.

104
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:54,588
Somewhere with
edible plants and water.

105
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:56,390

spew magic mushrooms

That's where it was.

111
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:06,399
Maybe we can pick up its trail.

112
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,402

who shot the footage.

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,312
It came this way.

163
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:13,285
I'm getting a reading
from this direction.

164
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:15,954
Great. We've left
the crowd behind,

165
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:18,423
and now we're trespassing.

166

We're not the most
sociable bunch

00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,885
is trying to make
a serious statement

183
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:07,186
about his position in the pack,

184
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:08,554
in which case, peeing
on the door every morning

185
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:09,455
might be quicker.

186
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:12,290
It's the symbol

187
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:14,926
for the fine structure constant
of the universe,

188
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:16,294
and that right there
is bad news.

189
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,698
Why?

190
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:20,966
[Evan]: This place
belongs to Howard Kanan.

191
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,868
Guy's a legend.

195
00:09:26,938 --> 00:09:28,171
Every arena he worked in,

196
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:29,406
he was brilliant.

197
00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:30,774
Certifiable genius.

198
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:31,976
Genius?

199
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:34,778
Like he could understand
how that thing works?

200
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:37,280
We've got to find that creature

201
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:39,850
and get it out of here
before Kanan sees it.

202
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:41,418
If he knew, he'd want in.

203
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:42,486
Do you know that he buried

204
00:09:42,553 --> 00:09:44,153
every single company
that got in his way?

205
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:45,788
You know a lot about him.

206
00:09:45,856 --> 00:09:48,024
Yeah, we've crossed paths.

207
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:49,692
I'm lucky I still
have my company.

You thieving prick.

210

So, you two know each other.

211
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,607
Mostly from court.

212
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:06,042
He tried to sue me
for patent infringement,

213
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:07,176
but he didn't have a case.

214
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:09,145

I heard there was
a rare specimen out here.

223
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,361
Would that be
the black oyster-catcher

224
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:29,965

229
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:42,209
or just steal them?

230
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:43,510
You know what,
I think it's about time

231
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,512
you and I straightened out
this whole misunderstanding.

232
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:48,147
You did not pioneer
photonic circuitry.

233
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,148
I did.

234
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,150
So which part

235
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,351
am I misunderstanding?

236
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,920
I invented it, and he stole it.

237
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,624
If you'd like, I can prove it.

238
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:59,292
He can't prove that.

239
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,527
Yes, I can.

Hang on, if you think
you have proof,

242
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,634
I should be the one
that you show.

Yeah, great, awesome.

249

another message?

So the dinosaurs are
finally out of the bag?

Yeah, and I have
to figure out a way

figure out a way to stop this,

then we're going to have
a lot of people

that we don't want to answer.

really want a discourse

This isn't a joke, Howard.

No, I get that.

This is
the space-time continuum.

552
00:26:55,626 --> 00:26:57,293
It has world-ending potential,

553
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,593
and you don't want to be

555
00:27:02,698 --> 00:27:04,390

Hmm.

557
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:11,873
So why are you messing with it?

558
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:12,974
I don't have a choice.

559
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,510
As dangerous as
these anomalies may be,

560
00:27:16,578 --> 00:27:19,747
it's the only thing we have
to put these creatures back.

561
00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:24,419
Have you ever been through one?

562

563
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:29,789
Yeah.

564

Once or twice.

565
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,328
And...

566
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:36,529
was it amazing?

567
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,766
And frightening.

568
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:42,669
Look, the only thing
I'm trying to do

569
00:27:42,736 --> 00:27:44,338
is keep every single thing
where it belongs.

570

get to be your job?

Yeah, they appear,
they fluctuate,

Elaborate on that.

666

What if it's not about
overlapping sine waves?

667
00:32:04,362 --> 00:32:05,662
What...

668
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,099
Let me explain.

669
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:10,300
The anomalies,
they're magnetic, right?

670
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:11,434
So every time they appear,

671
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:13,236
there's going to be
a unique signature

672
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:14,537

Done.

675
00:32:16,907 --> 00:32:19,242
So it's not a pattern
you're trying to predict.

676
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,176
Of course.

677
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:21,644
It's a harmonic signature.

678
00:32:21,712 --> 00:32:23,179
Right.

679
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:25,047

past the critical threshold...

00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:34,756

are almost all killers.

But today we finally
had one that wasn't,

882
00:41:30,472 --> 00:41:31,972

was show it the way home,

883
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,207

to keep them out,

I would come out,
and I would f-find...

894
00:42:13,779 --> 00:42:18,849
They would get tangled
in the wire sometimes.

895
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:21,386
They'd chew their own paws off.

896
00:42:23,822 --> 00:42:27,858
That's really when I got it,
you know?

897
00:42:27,926 --> 00:42:29,260
It isn't their fault, right?

898
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:30,727

everything to be human.

the whole damn world

in razor wire,

903
00:42:38,535 --> 00:42:39,968
so where are...

00:42:40,036 --> 00:42:41,796
Where are the animals
supposed to go?

905
00:42:43,907 --> 00:42:45,474

a better way to help them,

It's to help them.

It's the least
we can do, right?

00:43:31,918 --> 00:43:34,053
The mission objective
was compromised

915
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,755
by circumstances, sir.

916
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:37,056
But on the positive side,

917
00:43:37,123 --> 00:43:39,792
the specimen was returned
to its natural habitat.

918
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,494
And there was
an interesting, um, development.

919
00:43:42,562 --> 00:43:45,530
I'll have that in my report.

920
00:43:45,598 --> 00:43:49,133
Uh, yes, sir,
that goes without saying.

921
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:52,838
We are on the same team.

922
00:43:52,905 --> 00:43:54,673
Yes, sir.

923
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:09,987
