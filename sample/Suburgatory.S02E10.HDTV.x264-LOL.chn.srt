00:00:00,727 --> 00:00:01,681
在高中
In high school,

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:03,684
很多事情只要你愿意
there's practically no limit to the number of things

3
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:06,496
便当真可以不要底线 出人意料的是
you can try your hand at. In a surprise move,

4
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:10,495
最近我决定喜欢一下瑞安・夏依
I had recently signed up for liking Ryan Shay.

5
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:12,536
要是一年前的我看那边会想
A year ago, I would've looked over there and thought,

6
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:14,452
"一群四肢发达的蠢货"
"what a bunch of dumb jocks."

7
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:16,994
而现在我看见那边却想的是...
And now I look over there and think...

8
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:18,230
"嗨 瑞安"
"Hey, Ryan."

9
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,036
我想这次的领养风波
I think this whole adoption thing

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,577
给他通了一些人性
has really helped humanize him,

11
00:00:21,593 --> 00:00:23,994
{\a6}温蒂汉堡连锁店的总裁 改良了甜点口味


12
00:00:21,593 --> 00:00:23,994
就好像我们对大卫・托马斯的感觉一样
you know, like when we found out about Dave Thomas.

13
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:27,513
突然间他做的冰冻甜点还是有那么一点儿甜的
Suddenly his frozen dairy dessert tasted bittersweet.

14
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:29,421
你好 奥塔曼小姐
Good day, Miss Altman.

15
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,121
继续保密 是吗?
Keeping it tight, I presume?

16
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,026
你什么毛病?
What's wrong with you?

17
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:34,301
我不太确定该不该
I didn't know if people at school

18
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,126
让学校的人知道我们的事
were supposed to know about us or not.

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
知道什么?
Know what?

20
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:40,190
当然是我俩那痴缠的爱
About our love and how tender it is.

21
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,896
别矫情了 我不介意
Don't be weird. I don't care.

22
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:45,907
你听到了吗 卡斯温?
You hear that, Chatswin?

23
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:47,072
她不介意!
She doesn't care!

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,699
我和特萨毫不怯于
Tessa and I aren't embarrassed

25
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,943
向世人展现我们缠绵的爱
to express how tender our love is.

26
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:52,812
非常非常痴缠!
It's extremely tender!

27
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,500
耶!
Yeah!

28
00:00:57,582 --> 00:01:00,391
祝贺你 特萨
Congratulations, Tessa.

29
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:01,783
我没想到
I had no idea things

30
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:03,267
你俩能发展到痴缠的地步
were so tender between the two of you.

31
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:04,919
大家做梦都想不到
No one in their wildest dreams

32
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:06,656
你居然把到了橄榄球运动员
expected you to snag a football player.

33
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,603
这好比一个少了腿的运动员赢下了
It would be like that runner with no legs

34
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:09,541
奥运会跑步比赛
winning the Olympics.

35
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:10,378
谢谢
Thanks.

36
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:13,154
听着 你现在是橄榄球队的家属了
Listen, you're a football girlfriend now.

37
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,079
我们就不计你过去的种种消极和扭捏
And we're going to look past your negativity and smugness

38
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,179
张开怀抱欢迎你 
and embrace you, 

39
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,184
因为这是橄榄球队家属们应该做的
because that's what football girlfriends do.

40
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:21,600
在你熟知你的责任前可以先跟着我学
You can shadow me till you get the hang of it.

41
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,360
别担心 你有一个好老师
Don't worry. You're in good hands.

42
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,440
安布尔已经培养出了
Amber's trained some

43
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:26,481
许多非常优秀的橄榄球家属
of the best football girlfriends in the field.

44
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,131
你可以把这条写进你的大学申请里
You should put that on your college application.

45
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:29,710
我干吗要上大学?
Why would I go to college?

46
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,704
我已经觅到了我未来的夫君
I've already met my future husband.

47
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:34,332
从今往后 我要记得在做新的决定之前
From now on, before signing up for things,

48
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,123
一定先瞅一眼那些附加条款
I should remember to read the fine print.

49
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:39,564
看看这打印效果 看看这分辨率 乔治
Look at that fine print and look at the D.P.I., George.

50
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:40,807
看一下嘛!
Just look at it!

51
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:42,692
这台打印机是我这辈子见过的最好的东西
This printer is the best thing that's ever happened to me,

52
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:44,522
{\a6}美国喜剧演员兼编剧


53
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:44,522
我还见过盖瑞・山德林
and I met garry Shandling.

54
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,947
有了这台打印机 我便能帮大家印证梦想
With this printer, I can finally print people's dreams come true.

55
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,324
不过这不是我的梦想 对不?
But this isn't my dream, right?

56
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,716
别傻了 你可是国王
Don't be silly. You're a monarch.

57
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:54,118
看看你这华丽又饱满的面庞 乔治?
See how lush and saturated you look, George?

58
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:56,050
连养乐多都说你的脸很饱满
Even Yakult said you look saturated.

59
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,624
好吧 谢谢你 达拉斯 你真贴心
Yes. Okay. Thank you, Dallas, this is very sweet.

60
00:01:58,658 --> 00:01:59,552
我感动死了 
I appreciate it. 

61
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,118
我们是不是该做一些标签?
Should we start cutting the tabs?

62
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:02,369
我要去见诺亚
I have to go meet Noah.

63
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:05,639
- 乔治? - 哈?
- George? - Huh?

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,859
那是啥?
What is that?

65
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:09,019
哦 就是一些文件啥的
Oh. That's just some files and stuff.

66
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,301
它们哪里像文件
They don't look like files.

67
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:12,641
明明是我的海报
They look like more of my flyers.

68
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:15,169
对 我...我...不就这么说的
Yeah, that... that... that's what I said.

69
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:16,502
文...海报
File-ers.

70
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:18,478
我在查尔斯顿学习过一阵子
Sometimes my Southern accent comes out

71
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:20,368
所以说话有点南方口音
from my semester in Charleston.

72
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,446
- 亲亲宝贝 - 哦
- Honey child. - Oh.

73
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:36,248
我也想尽量对橄榄球家属们不要有偏见
I wanted to have an open mind about the football girlfriends.

74
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,367
但她们把这个变得异常困难
They just made it so damn hard.

75
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:39,618
这里就是我们
This is where we bake

76
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,989
准备点心袋的地方
the treats for the goody bags

77
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:43,260
到比赛日我们会把它送给我们的男友
that we give to our boyfriends on game day.

78
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,787
我们这样做不是为了一句感谢
We don't do it for the thank-yous

79
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:46,651
因为他们也不会说感谢
because they don't say thank you.

80
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:48,835
我们乐在其中
We do it because it's tons of fun.

81
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:54,234
这里就是我们帮男朋友们写作业的地方
So this is where we do our boyfriends' homework

82
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,293
这样他们才能专心练习
so they can focus on practice.

83
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,958
我们这样做是为了一句感谢吗?
So we do this for the thank-yous?

84
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,335
不 特萨 我们从不言谢
Tessa, no. There are no thank-yous.

85
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:04,601
我们这么做是为了让我们的男人专注于取胜
We do this because it helps our guys to concentrate on victory,

86
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,428
久而久之 你会感觉他们的胜利
and over time, their victories will start

87
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,267
就是自己的胜利
to feel like your victories.

88
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:10,939
这也是一种自我奖赏 你会明白的
And that's it's own reward. You'll see.

89
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,034
这是赛前动员会总部
And this is the pep rally nerve center.

90
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:20,011
哇
Wow.

91
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:21,851
简直就像...
Looks like...

92
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,252
血汗工厂
a sweatshop.

93
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:24,947
我们称之为奉献坑
We call it the devotion pit.

94
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:26,899
我们在这儿做汗衫 横幅
It's where we make the T-shirts, banners,

95
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:29,496
各种小道具来表达我们的爱意
and miscellaneous sundries that express our love,

96
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:31,392
忠贞和拥戴
loyalty, and allegiance.

97
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,513
由此看来你们基本上就像在扮演旧时代
So you girls are basically mindless servants

98
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,752
毫无主见任凭使唤的女仆
struggling to uphold outdated gender roles?

99
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:37,442
你总算明白了
Now you got it.

100
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:38,975
并且你祀奉时间越长
And the longer you serve,

101
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:40,933
你加油的声音就越响亮 你会明白的
the louder you cheer. You'll see.

102
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,100
是德里克
It's Derek.

103
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:47,772
加油 德里克! 正想给你打电话呢 宝贝!
Let's go, Derek! Way to dial that phone, baby!

104
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:49,449
回答得很好 琼
Good phone answer, Joan.

105
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,162
谢谢
Thanks.

106
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:52,027
杀了我吧
No.

107
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:53,278
德里克也许喜欢这样
Derek may have been into it,

108
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:55,494
但有些人会觉得这种忘乎所以的加油鼓劲
but some people find relentless cheer-leading...

109
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:57,771
让人窒息 你知道 对我来说
Stifling. You know, to... to me,

110
00:03:57,809 --> 00:03:59,817
每一张海报也好像在说
each one of those flyers might as well say,

111
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,656
"我蔑视你 乔治・奥塔曼
"I judge you, George Altman.

112
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,047
我蔑视你因为你不够成功"
I judge you for not being successful enough."

113
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,118
达拉斯本来就很挑剔 
Dallas is judge-y. She is.

114
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:08,721
我们刚认识的时候 我还不是天窗之王
When she met me, I was not a skylight king.

115
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:10,973
听着 如果你是天窗之王
Look, if you're the skylight king,

116
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:13,063
那她就是皇后
then she's the queen.

117
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:14,828
行了 伙计们 那正是他们所追求的
All right, and that, my friends, is what they all want.

118
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,362
他们要地位 他们要安定
They want status. They... they want stability.

119
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:18,069
的确如此
They do.

120
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:20,221
要不然我干嘛当牙医
Why do you think I became a dentist?

121
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:21,860
哥路子可宽着呢
I could've been anything.

122
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,568
你看过我在高低杠上无所不能的样子么?
Have you ever seen me on the uneven bars?

123
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:26,140
他就像只老鹰 带手臂的
He's like an eagle with arms.

124
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,291
还带腿
And two legs.

125
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:29,442
还带张猴子脸 他长得挺像猴子
And a monkey's face. He's like a monkey.

126
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:32,558
他们凭什么把这些角色强加于我们 不公平
It doesn't seem fair that they can thrust these roles upon us.

127
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:36,461
迫使我们将自己的小世界建于地下室
Forcing us to build miniature cities in our basements.

128
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,659
我正在这么做
I'm building a miniature city in my basement.

129
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,204
- 挺不错的 - 好吧
- It's actually pretty cool. - Okay.

130
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:42,324
忘了什么天窗
Forget skylights.

131
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:45,027
如果现在给你机会干一番事业 你想做什么?
If you could start any business right now, what would it be?

132
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:48,843
那必须得是玩音乐的
I'd be in the business of rocking.

133
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:50,426
坏男孩
Ooh! Bad boy.

134
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:52,078
几年前我加入过一个老爸乐队
I was in a dad band a few years ago.

135
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:53,867
我负责贝斯
I played the bass guitar.

136
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:56,157
有个小妞很热情 我叫她罗达
Slapped her silly. Named her Rhoda.

137
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:58,121
{\a6}罗达:美剧"罗达"里女主的名字


138
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:58,121
我超爱那部电视剧
I'm a big fan of that TV show.

139
00:04:58,403 --> 00:05:01,080
爱死了 一集不落
Loved it. Never missed an episode.

140
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:04,234
伙计们 我们是当爸的 会摇滚的老爸
Guys, we're dads... dads who rock.

141
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:05,698
我们现在干嘛
Why is it

142
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:07,825
为毛不重振摇滚雄风?
we are not rocking out together?

143
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:09,846
- 是啊 干嘛不 - 问得好!
- I don't know. - That's a good question!

144
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:11,101
接下来怎么办? 
Then what say ye? 

145
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,265
老爸们 我们是不是该重拾自我
Dads, shall we redefine who we are

146
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:15,064
成为我们想成为的人?
and define who it is we want to be?

147
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:18,068
对 我们是不是得实实在在干一场 
Yea, verily, shall we do something

148
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:20,784
真正逍遥法外一次?
that our partners can't control or dictate?

149
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:24,431
我们是不是把乐队取名叫"希拉的男宠"?
Shall we call our band "Sheila's Pets"?

150
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:26,371
不 弗雷德 这不行
No, Fred. No, we shall not.

151
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:28,004
这名字太糟了
That is a terrible name.

152
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,293
噢
Oh.

153
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:38,246
你跟那些橄榄球姑娘们处得怎样?
So how are you and the football girls getting along?

154
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:39,785
好极了
Great.

155
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:41,262
我就知道你们会合得来
I knew you'd hit it off.

156
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,859
安布尔有一段很有趣的经历
Amber's had a really interesting journey.

157
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:48,714
她以前老想跟我们侧边锋罗纳多约会
She always wanted to date Renaldo, our tight end,

158
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,047
但她那时候是个胖妞
but she used to be fat.

159
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:53,894
后来她减肥成功...
Then she lost a ton of weight...

160
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:58,236
他们就好上了
and then they hooked up.

161
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:01,470
不会吧 真的诶 真的很有趣
No. Yeah, that's really interesting.

162
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:04,709
可不是 太有趣了 不仅有趣还很励志
Yeah, it is interesting. It's interesting and it's inspiring.

163
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,025
太励志了
Really inspiring.

164
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:09,709
她的故事真的很棒
Yeah, she's got a great story.

165
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:12,437
正好提醒了我 我说好了12:45
Oh. Ah, that reminds me, I'm supposed to give Renaldo

166
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:14,145
跟罗纳多碰头
a noogie at 12:45.

167
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,677
我得先走了 糟糕
I better go. Shoot.

168
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:16,622
拜
Bye.

169
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:18,156
拜拜 拜
Bye-bye. Bye.

170
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:21,439
等下 你刚真觉得那姑娘的故事
So wait. Did you actually think that girl's story

171
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,897
- 有意思? - 不
- was interesting? - Nope.

172
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,512
对嘛 那你为啥不跟瑞安实话实说?
Right. So why aren't you being honest with Ryan?

173
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:27,277
你知道有时我会
Okay, you know how sometimes I can...

174
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:30,149
泼冷水 或者说自鸣得意?
be a little negative or... smug?

175
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,807
- 超爱说教 - 没错
- Preachy at times. - Right.

176
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:33,803
- 噼里啪啦没完 - 行了 丽莎 是
- Soapbox-y. - Okay, Lisa. Yep.

177
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:37,373
我在尽力改
I'm... I'm trying not to do that.

178
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,289
我想给他多点支持
I'm just trying to be supportive.

179
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:40,576
有意思
Interesting.

180
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,095
我看要跟大块头橄榄球健将约会
Well, I guess conformity's a small price to pay

181
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,774
这点服从的小代价还是值的
if you want to date a big, beefy football player.

182
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:50,601
现在是怎样 橄榄球比曲棍球高级吗
So what, football's a better sport than lacrosse?

183
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,003
是的 马利克
Yes, Malik.

184
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,986
别理他
Ignore him.

185
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:56,551
也许跟瑞安约会就注定了这一切 不是吗
Maybe this is what it means to be dating Ryan, right?

186
00:06:56,554 --> 00:06:57,577
你看 有些人的体质
You know, some people's physiques

187
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,891
更适合去打曲棍球
lend themselves more to lacrosse,

188
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:00,942
曲棍球可比看上去难多了
which... which is a lot harder than it looks.

189
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:02,926
你这是给自己难堪呢 马利克
You are embarrassing yourself, Malik.

190
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:05,441
不 你才丢脸 在橄榄球队员面前摇尾乞怜?
No, you are. Fawning over football players?

191
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,243
我倒想看看他们用曲棍球护球时
I'd like to see one of them make a fast break

192
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:08,488
如何来个快攻
while maintaining his cradle.

193
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:11,334
没人懂你在说什么 马利克
Nobody knows what you're talking about, Malik.

194
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:14,237
想坐那边...
Do you want to go sit...

195
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,090
不不 吃你的 别引围观
No. No. Eat your food. Don't cause a scene.

196
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,323
好嘞 今晚我们要做
Okay, so tonight we're working

197
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:20,411
巨型横幅
on the giant paper banner

198
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:22,301
动员大会上全队会穿过横幅
that the team will run through at the pep rally.

199
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,647
沿袭惯例 我们用泡泡笔和闪光笔
Typically, we work with puffy pens and glitter,

200
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,624
不过你要是想试试新花样
but if you want to try something else...

201
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:28,831
免了吧 还是用
Don't. It's best if you just stick

202
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:30,339
泡泡笔和闪光笔
with the puffy pens and glitter.

203
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:31,309
好吧
Okay.

204
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,349
就爱你的激情 特萨
I love your enthusiasm, Tessa.

205
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:37,228
好了 搞得定不?
All right. You got this?

206
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:40,218
我在乐队里可是举足轻重的
I've played my fair share of "rock band."

207
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:42,777
我说的是演奏"光子黑洞"的那四人
I'm talking four stars for "Black Hole Sun"

208
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:45,198
太 "专业"了 哥们
on "Expert," brosef.

209
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,285
好嘞 还不错嘛
All right, not bad.

210
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:54,984
有点疯克的赶脚
Getting funky now.

211
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,643
疯克 我今晚要疯克罗达全家
Funky? I'm gonna funking funk the funk out of Rhoda tonight.

212
00:07:57,663 --> 00:07:59,301
罗达那个贱人
Rhoda's a filthy lady.

213
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,792
这真的太棒了 兄弟们 太棒了
This is pretty sweet, guys. Pretty sweet.

214
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,427
我得说 骗希拉我有业务
I have to say, it felt good to finally tell Sheila

215
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:07,722
得赶紧去的感觉真好
I found a deer tick and had to run to urgent care.

216
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:10,325
好嘞 我在此宣布老爹的逆袭
Okay, I... I hereby declare the first rehearsal

217
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,158
或者说老爹的大破坏
of full-on Fatherly Assault

218
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:15,256
第一次彩排
or Fathers of Mass Destrucktion

219
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:16,388
开始了!
in session!

220
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,984
哟!
Yo!

221
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:20,840
明白了 所以希拉的男宠都没资格参选
I see. So Sheila's Pets isn't even on the ballot.

222
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:22,608
是的 而且... 既然我们谈到这问题
No, and... and since we're talking about it,

223
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:25,478
我还把"中国小鸡"从演奏列表中去掉了
I'm also vetoing the "Chickity China" song from the set list.

224
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:27,706
- 什么?! - 是的 那不是歌曲名
- What?! - Yeah, that's not the name of the song,

225
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:28,983
而且没人想唱
and no one wants to sing it.

226
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:31,279
没人想唱中国小鸡吗?
Nobody wants to sing about Chinese chicken?

227
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:33,150
- 我不... - 没... 我们都不想
- I don't. - N... neither of us do.

228
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:35,384
# 中国小鸡啊 中国的小鸡 #
Chickity China, the Chinese chicken

229
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:37,568

是的 我对这歌很熟 但还是不行
Yes, I'm familiar with it. Still a no.

230
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:41,265
坐下 排练吧 开始咯
Sit down. Let's do this. Here we go.

231
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:46,777
- 那是青蛙吗? - 什么?
- Is that a frog? - What?

232
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:48,823
你...在横幅上画青蛙吗?
Are you... are you drawing a frog on the banner?

233
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,999
你不...你不该这么做
You're not... you're not supposed to.

234
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:51,413
噢 我...
Oh. I...

235
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:52,909
只是...
just...

236
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,911
我知道怎么画 所以...
know how to draw them, so...

237
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:56,588
是啊 我还是会...会乖乖写字
Yeah. I would... I would just stick to the letters,

238
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:58,009
因为如果我们画画
because if we draw pictures,

239
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,210
运动员们就会停下来看 而不是...
the players will stop and look at 'em instead of...

240
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,775
毁掉我们花一整晚弄的杰作吗?
Destroying the artwork we spent all night making?

241
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,027
你看起来有点烦躁
You seem a little bit on edge.

242
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:07,124
试试剪掉这个尖头 会让你有点晕
If you snip the tip, you can catch a buzz.

243
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,722
这样时间会过得比较快
Makes the night go faster.

244
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:13,677
是嘛 我知道另一种方式来消磨时间
Yeah. I know another way to make the night go by faster.

245
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,240
知道是什么吗? 回家!
Know what it's called? Going home!

246
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:19,299
特萨
Tessa.

247
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:21,201
你小声点
Keep your voice down.

248
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:22,972
你说啥? 噢 你觉得
What's that? Oh, you think

249
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:25,293
我们不能画青蛙很无语? 我也觉得!
it's dumb we can't draw frogs? I agree!

250
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:27,126
我... 我没有...我没那样说过
I... I never... I... I never said that.

251
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,560
拜托! 我肯定大家有很多想做的事情
Come on! I'm sure there's all sorts of things you girls

252
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,393
但你们不能做 因为都耗在这儿了
wish you could do, but you can't, because you're here.

253
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:33,489
你们知道比耗这儿更好的是什么吗?
You know what's better than being here?

254
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,053
没有更好了 她喝醉了
There's nothing better. She's drunk.

255
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,323
我闻到她身上有酒味
I smell alcohol on her breath.

256
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,895
好吧 那就是...
Well, it's called...

257
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,238
回家
Going home.

258
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,853
我本不想搞什么临时演讲 但我忍不住了
I didn't want to get on a soapbox, but I am on one.

259
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:57,202
姑娘们 你们的需求和运动员们一样重要
Girls, your needs are just as important as a football player's.

260
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:59,317
像这边的斯蒂芬妮 她饿了
Look at Stephanie here. She's hungry.

261
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:01,356
她想出去吃点东西
She wants to go out for a slice.

262
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:02,751
她怎么知道的?
How did she know that?

263
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,696
还有你
And you.

264
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:05,254
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

265
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,818
我是德里克的女朋友
I'm Derek's girlfriend.

266
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:08,871
我是问你的名字 孩儿?
What is your name, child?

267
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:12,036
我...想说...叫琼
I... want to say... Joan.

268
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:13,613
我猜你就是
I bet you do.

269
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:15,515
你看起来就叫琼
You look like a Joan.

270
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:17,955
还有看看那个用沾满血的运动衫
And what about that girl over there

271
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:20,095
包着手的女孩
with the bloody Jersey wrapped around her hand?

272
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:22,234
她不用去看下医生吗?
Shouldn't she be seen by a doctor?

273
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,698
肖恩说在我脑子里
Sean says it's in my head.

274
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:25,406
不在你脑子里
It's not in your head.

275
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:27,333
你的手在流血
You are bleeding from your hand.

276
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,572
她需要紧急护理
She should be in urgent care,

277
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:32,644
而我们应该呆在家里看电视
and we should all be at home watching TV.

278
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:37,261
{\a6}郊区故事美国播放时间


279
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:35,378
现在是周三晚上九点半

Who's with me?

283
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:53,928
# 日复一日我愈发惆怅 #
Day after day I'm more confused 

284
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,358
# 我望着倾盆大雨中的闪电发呆 #
and I look for the light through the pouring rain 

285
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:05,997
# 你知道这是一场无法退却的游戏 #
you know that's a game that I hate to lose 

286
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:10,739
# 况且我还有些紧张 #
and I'm feeling the strain

287
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:13,229
# 是不是有些丢脸 哦 #
yeah, ain't it a shame? Oh 

288
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:17,134
# 来首歌吧 小伙子们 好让心情释放 #
give me the beat, boys, and free my soul 

289
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:20,031
# 我多想沉迷于你的摇滚 #
I want to get lost in your rock 'n' roll

290
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:22,836
# 随节奏逍遥飘散 #
and drift away

291
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:26,757
# 哦 #
oh

292
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,526
# 来首歌吧 小伙子们 好让心情释放 #
give me the beat, boys, and free my soul 

293
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:32,496
# 多想沉迷于你的摇滚 #
I want to get lost in Fred's rock 'n' roll 

294
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,229
# 就在今天 #
today

295
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:36,949
# 哦 随节奏逍遥飘散 # 弗雷德!
Oh! Drift away, Freddie!

296
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:38,250
# 随节奏逍遥飘散 #
Drift away!

297
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:39,353
# 耶 #
Yeah!

298
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:41,986
你们几个到底在做什么哟?
What in blue blazes are you doing?

299
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:43,725
- 希拉...- 你们难听的噪音
- Uh, Sheila... - Your filthy noise is

300
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:45,464
污染了整个邻里
polluting the entire neighborhood,

301
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:47,191
尤其是领唱的
particularly the lead vocals.

302
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:49,305
你唱歌跑调 乔治 跑调太厉害
You're pitchy, George, very pitchy.

303
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:50,431
但是贝斯手还不错 对不?
But the base was good, right?

304
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:51,958
- 我跑调? - 没错
- I'm pitchy? - Yeah.

305
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,209
好啊 我倒想看看你能强哪去
Okay. I'd like to see you do better.

306
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:57,286
好啊
Okay.

307
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:01,193
"梭鱼" 开始
"Barracuda." Hit it.

308
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:10,052
# 所以这不是结束 #
So this ain't the end

309
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:11,585
# 我再一次见到你 #
I saw you again

310
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:13,719
# 就在今天 #
today

311
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,238
# 不得不带着我的心离开 #
I had to turn my heart away

312
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:21,327
# 像太阳般的微笑 #
smiled like the sun

313
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:24,944
# 送给每个人 #
kisses for everyone

314
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:29,835
# 吻和传奇 永不落幕 #
and tales, it never fails

315
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,539
# 你躺在低低的杂草中 #
you lying so low in the weeds

316
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,759
# 我打赌你会伏击我 #
I bet you gonna ambush me

317
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:39,495
# 你会为我而倾倒 #
you'd have me down, down, down 

318
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:46,268
# 难道不是吗 梭鱼? #
now wouldn't you, barracuda?

319
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:48,521
# 噢噢噢噢 #
Oh, oh, oh, oh

320
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:00,469
这样...
So...

321
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,876
叫希拉的男宠么?
Sheila's Pets?

322
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:02,959
不 伙计
No, man.

323
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:04,879
这... 这可是老爸乐队
Th... this is a dad band.

324
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:07,720
不过希拉 不可否认真的很棒 有目共睹
But Sheila is undeniable. You saw her.

325
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:08,827
兄弟们...
Guys...

326
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,361
我这一辈子加入过的乐队多了去了...
I have been in a lot of bands in my life...

327
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:13,663
中学朋克乐队 大学高音乐队
high school punk bands, college alt bands,

328
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,396
在挣脱合唱团壮大前
I was briefly a member of Five for Fighting

329
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:18,471
我曾加入过... 而我这辈子从未
before they got big... and I have never in my life,

330
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:22,291
感到像今晚这样的 火花 
felt the kind of spark... I did tonight.

331
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:23,142
你什么意思?
What are you saying?

332
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:25,347
我是觉得我们应该让希拉加入乐队
I'm saying I think we should let Sheila in the band.

333
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,148
噢 快清醒吧 哥们!
Oh. Get a hold of yourself, man!

334
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,918
兄弟们 我们有机会做的很好
Guys, we could be good!

335
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,333
你们明白那意味着什么吗? 
Do you understand what that means? 

336
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:32,152
我们可以成为最好的
We could be good,

337
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:35,105
不是什么老爸乐队 而是真正的乐队
not dad-band good, but real-band good.

338
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:38,428
瞧 我之所以加入老爹的大破坏
Look, I joined Fathers of Mass Destroction...

339
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:40,436
或者可以叫父亲乐队
or I was also thinking Meinvater Band...

340
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:41,588
是因为...
because...

341
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,420
我们不光为了自己玩了
we stood for something.

342
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,029
我们代表着广大男同胞不必和老婆们在一起
We stood for not hanging out with our wives

343
00:13:46,073 --> 00:13:47,225
能有权自由支配晚上的时间
and taking back the night.

344
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:49,027
我们说好的一起玩呢 乔治?
What about the hanging out, George?

345
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:50,829
我们说好的薯条和蘸酱呢?
What about the chips and dip?

346
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,049
兄弟们 抱歉
Guys, I'm sorry.

347
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:54,189
我想 考虑到我是主唱
I think considering I'm the lead singer

348
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:56,585
兼吉他手 兼乐队创始人
and the guitarist, and I started this band,

349
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:58,988
这件事上你们得听我的
I gotta make the call on this one.

350
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,508
我必须为希拉的男宠着想
I have to do what's best for Sheila's pets.

351
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,920
很好...
Well...

352
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,646
那你就孤军奋战吧
then you do it alone.

353
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:09,467
朋友
My friend,

354
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:11,133
一个人哦
you do it alone.

355
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,434
我们走 弗雷德
Come on, Fred.

356
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:19,158
车库还不是唯一士气尽散的地方
Our garage wasn't the only place spirits were down.

357
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,371
最后
And finally,

358
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,313
人家永远愿意花一块钱买票看的四分卫
the quarterback that I would pay a dollar for...

359
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:25,958
只会看他一个哦
the one, the only,

360
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:30,212
瑞安 "我们的雄霸" 夏依
Ryan "The Body" Shay!

361
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:45,159
来吧 卡斯温
Come on, Chatswin.

362
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,336
士气在哪里?
Where's your spirit?!

363
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:51,173
你妹啊?
What the hell?

364
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:53,974
我们的橄榄球家属呢?!
Where's all the football girlfriends?!

365
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:58,732
这个队伍完全没有活力了
There is very little pep at this rally.

366
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:01,376
这事儿恐怕是因我的临时演讲而起
I might've had one of my soapbox incidents.

367
00:15:01,852 --> 00:15:05,161
好吧 我貌似把她们从劳役中解放了
Yeah, I kinda liberated the girls from their servitude

368
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:07,445
而且不合时宜的激励了她们一下
and unintentionally empowered them.

369
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,393
瑞安会弄死你哦
Mm. Ryan's gonna kill you.

370
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:12,612
这事谁他妈干的?!
Who did this?!

371
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:13,713
呵啊?!
Huh?!

372
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,404
有种站出来
Show yourself!

373
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:17,093
没关系 打起精神 兄弟们!
It's okay. Get up, boys!

374
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:18,413
没他们我们也会赢!
We can win still!

375
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:19,909
会赢
We can win.

376
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:21,880
正当我浇灭瑞安胜利的梦想时
While I had dashed Ryan's dreams of glory,

377
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,858
- 乔治花钱请了一帮乐手...- 耶!
- George had hired some session musicians... - Yeah!

378
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:26,431
开始实现他的梦想... 和希拉一起 
And was making his own dreams come true... with Sheila. 

379
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:27,705
# 我要吃糖 #
I want candy

380
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,314
# 嘿 我要吃糖 #
hey, I want candy

381
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:33,650
# 呼! #
Hoo!

382
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:37,147
来点激情 乔治 赶紧的
Put some stank on it, George. Come on!

383
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,617
呼! 呼!
Whoo! Whoo!

384
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:44,485
好的 休息五分钟 休息五分钟
All right, let's take five. Let's take five.

385
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,119
表现很棒 伙计们
Sounds great, guys.

386
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,740
我琢磨唱摇滚会渴! 所以
I know rocking's a thirsty business, so I...

387
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:52,330
哦! 哦 希拉
Oh! Oh, Sheila.

388
00:15:52,506 --> 00:15:53,801
俺们不接受请求
We don't take requests.

389
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:58,036
不是 我只是以为乔治的乐队里只有老爸们
No. I just thought George's band was a daddy-only thing.

390
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:00,345
你不是这么告诉我的嘛 老爹?
Isn't that what you told me, daddy?

391
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:03,248
这个嘛 本来是这样的 但是后来...
Well, you know what? It was, uh, but then...

392
00:16:03,473 --> 00:16:05,275
- 关键是 额...- 乔治?
- The thing is, uh... - George?

393
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:07,021
- 咋啦? - 告诉你家小可爱够了
- Yeah? - Tell your piece to hit it.

394
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,844
不好意思 我们这不要小撒娇
Sorry. We have a no-Yoko policy.

395
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,812
好了
Okay.

396
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:15,967
嘿
Hey.

397
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:17,603
我们输了
We lost the game.

398
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,696
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

399
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:22,874
我们开场没有从纸糊的横幅中穿过去
No one even got to run through a paper banner made of paper.

400
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:24,511
我知道
I know.

401
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:27,914
那是橄榄球比赛中大家最喜欢的环节 特萨
That's everyone's favorite part of football, Tessa.

402
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:30,975
一半人是因为这个才开始玩橄榄球的
That's why half of us started playing in the first place.

403
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:33,803
我们如何击败一只从横幅中冲出来的队伍
I mean, how can we beat a team that got to run through paper

404
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:34,911
而我们没有机会
when we haven't had the advantage

405
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,425
穿越纸糊的横幅?
of running through paper ourselves?

406
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,334
是不是你们有点太在意
Is it possible you're putting too much importance

407
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:40,904
冲出纸糊的横幅了?
on running through paper?

408
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,263
是不是你脑子被驴踢了?
Is it possible that you're crazy?

409
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,055
你看 瑞安 那些给你们做横幅的妹子...
Look, Ryan, those girls making your banners...

410
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,376
她们也应该去追逐自我啊
they're out there pursuing their own interests.

411
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,977
她们可以吃披萨
They're eating pizza

412
00:16:50,984 --> 00:16:53,304
融入大家的圈子中
and becoming well-rounded people.

413
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:54,706
她们生活的目标
Their sole purpose in life

414
00:16:54,737 --> 00:16:56,914
不可能只是崇拜他们的男朋友
cannot be to worship their boyfriends.

415
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,698
是你干的?
You did this?

416
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:02,995
我其实没打算拆散组织 好吧 是我做的
I didn't mean to dismantle the system, but yeah, I did.

417
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:06,880
很抱歉如果让你不开心了
And I'm really sorry if you're upset.

418
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,095
我早该知道你根本不想
I should've known you didn't really want

419
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:10,890
融入我的圈子
to fit in with my friends.

420
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:14,669
你永远都想打破成规
You always have to shake it up.

421
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:16,245
你永远要煽动
You always have to make

422
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:18,945
别人...思考
people... think.

423
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:21,178
我就是个思想家 瑞安 我总会思考
I am a thinker, Ryan. I think.

424
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:23,259
我以为那正是你喜欢我的原因
I thought you liked that about me.

425
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:25,787
再想想 思想家
Think again, thinker.

426
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,504
再想想
Think again.

427
00:17:38,694 --> 00:17:40,934
达拉斯 让俺解释一下
Dallas, let me explain, please.

428
00:17:40,947 --> 00:17:42,060
没啥可解释的
There's nothing to explain.

429
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,544
你跟你的小朋友们组小乐队
You started your little band with your little friends

430
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:47,096
你就可以逃避跟我一起做有趣的印刷工作
so you could avoid doing fun printing jobs with me.

431
00:17:47,122 --> 00:17:49,522
我知道 达拉斯 现在我... 
Look, Dallas, now I... 

432
00:17:49,523 --> 00:17:51,602
我知道你想要我变得有钱有势
I know you want me to be rich and powerful

433
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:54,474
事业蓬勃发展
and to grow my business into some huge empire,

434
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,865
但是内心深处我不想承认我是这样...
but part of me is unwilling to admit that I am this...

435
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,178
也 也不是这样
and... and not this.

436
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,479
一个马桶?
A toilet?

437
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:04,123
哦 这本应该是"滚石乐队"的
Oh, that was supposed to be "Rolling Stone."

438
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:05,216
你应该懂我的意思
But you know what I mean.

439
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,538
乔治 我会支持你的 无论你要成为
George, I will support you whether you want to be

440
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:09,904
天窗王或是乐队王
the skylight king or the King of Leon.

441
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:11,356
是谁都无所谓
Whoever the hell he is.

442
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,232
真的吗? 但是
Really? Because

443
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:15,421
你为了我这么辛苦做了这些传单
you were coming at me so hard with those flyers.

444
00:18:15,446 --> 00:18:16,894
这... 这让我觉得...
It... it kind of felt like...

445
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:18,324
你想要改变我
Like you were trying to change me.

446
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:21,032
我花了七千块买复印机 乔治
I spent $7,000 on a printer, George.

447
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,960
七千块啊
$7,000.

448
00:18:22,962 --> 00:18:25,120
我当然想要它有用武之地
I sure as hell better use it.

449
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,371
你看
Look,

450
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:29,730
当女人在她不需要的东西上
sometimes when a woman spends too much money

451
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:31,757
花了一大笔钱的时候
on something she really doesn't need,

452
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,902
她就想要让每个人认为
she tries to cram it down everyone else's throats

453
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:35,380
她花钱是值得的
to justify the purchase.

454
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:37,299
你肯定能理解的
Surely you can understand that.

455
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,683
我很抱歉 达拉斯
Well, I'm sorry, Dallas.

456
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:41,141
我... 我可能是有点自卫敏感
I... I guess I was being a little defensive

457
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:43,575
因为史蒂文...
because Steven was such...

458
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:46,885
在我的心灵留下了一道深刻的划痕?
An absolute skid mark on the pristine panties of my soul?

459
00:18:47,704 --> 00:18:50,063
不管这个人多么有钱
No matter how much money that man had,

460
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:52,071
都不够留住我的心
it wasn't enough to keep me.

461
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,917
我很高兴听你这么说
I'm glad to hear you say that.

462
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:57,736
嘿 你猜怎么着?
Hey. You know what?

463
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,142
我们的乐队需要一些传单
Our band does need some flyers.

464
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:02,888
你认识的人谁有一台七千块的复印机吗?
Now do you know anyone that has a $7,000 printer who could help?

465
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,108
我正好有哦
You know I do.

466
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:06,711
好的
Okay.

467
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,547
你们乐队的名字叫什么?
What's the name of your band?

468
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,027
额...
Uh...

469
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,705
拦截
Interception.

470
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:22,169
有意思
Funny.

471
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,312
谢谢
Thanks.

472
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:27,332
我很抱歉...
I'm really sorry...

473
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:29,597
昨天的事情
about yesterday.

474
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,803
可能是我反应有点过度了
It's possible that I overreacted a little bit.

475
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:33,938
但是你让我思考了
But you made me think.

476
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,048
我过去不想思考 
I didn't want to, 

477
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,067
但是你改变了我 你总会让我思考
but you made me, like you always do,

478
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,027
然后我觉得...
and I think...

479
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,246
每个人都需要被鼓励
that everyone needs to be cheered for,

480
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,914
不只是我们这些队员
not just us guys.

481
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:47,502
所以... 兄弟们?
So... bros?

482
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,090
这是什么?
What's this?

483
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:55,427
我想要你感受穿过这张纸的感觉有多棒
I want you to see how good it feels to run through paper.

484
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,820
我不想冲破这张纸
I don't want to run through paper.

485
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,964
我为你思考了 现在你也要为了我试一下
I did your thing. Now you're gonna try mine.

486
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,682
我想要你知道有人为你加油的感觉
I want you to know how good it feels

487
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:04,202
是多么棒
to have someone rooting for you.

488
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:07,856
好的 来吧
Okay. Fine.

489
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,469
3 2 1!
Three, two, one!

490
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,900
冲啊！
Go!

491
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:24,591
我不得不承认 这感觉确实很爽
I had to admit, it was pretty exhilarating...

492
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,460
还有... 一点丢人
and... a little embarrassing.

493
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:32,074
喔！粉碎这些数字 特萨!
Whoo! Crush those numbers, Tessa!

494
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:34,132
搞定数学！
Destroy that math!

495
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,633
耶!
Yeah!

496
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,218
所有的公园都可以随意着装吗?
Are all the parks clothing-optional?

497
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:41,985
是的 不过虽然如此 我还没有找到任何
Yeah, but I haven't been able to find any nude figurines

498
00:20:41,997 --> 00:20:43,004
有裸像的 所以...
at that scale, so...

499
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:44,725
决定了
Okay.

500
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:46,020
嗯
Hmm.

501
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,272
"中国小鸡"
"Chinese Chicken."

502
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,272
{\a6}出自加拿大摇滚乐队<一周>
作为歌词意译为"消沉"

503
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:49,898
然后 你
And, you,

504
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:52,145
你给乐队起个名字 什么样的名字都行
you get to name the band whatever you want.

505
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,402
我不知道 乔治
I don't know, George.

506
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:56,119
我觉得这事差不多玩完了
I think it's kind of ruined now.

507
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,971
对 还有如果你这么喜欢希拉
Yeah. And if you love Sheila so much,

508
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,407
干嘛不跟她结婚?
why don't you marry her?

509
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:00,575
求你了 别
Please don't.

510
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,410
好吧 你们有权对我生气
Look, you have every right to be upset with me,

511
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:04,510
但是这是... 这可是...
but it's... it's been...

512
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:08,032
# 一周前你看着我 #
One week since you looked at me 

513
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:12,268
# 你把头歪向一边 说"我很生气" #
cocked your head to the side and said "I'm angry"

514
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:17,054
# 五天前你嘲笑我 #
Five days since you laughed at me

515
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:19,094
# 我如此消沉失意 #
chickity China the Chinese chicken 

516
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,728
不 弗雷德 不 错了 还没到这句
No, Fred. No. No, it's too soon.

517
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:21,744
绝对到了
It's never too soon.

518
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,530
# 当我打破韵律 热辣得像芥末酱 #
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes,

519
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:24,562
# 性感如同黎安・莱姆丝 #
big like leann rimes

520
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:26,107
# 因为我估摸着 #
because I'm all about value  

521
00:21:26,145 --> 00:21:27,765
# 贝特・肯普菲尔特要被揍 #
bert kaempfert's got the mad hits 

522
00:21:27,784 --> 00:21:28,847
# 你想要跟我斗智斗勇 #
you try to match wits 

523
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:30,380
# 你想要控制我 但是我突出了重围 #
you try to hold me but I bust through 

524
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:31,581
# 打算休息一下 打个马虎眼 #
gonna make a break and take a fake   

525
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,545
# 我想要烂醉如泥地摇摆 #
I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake  

526
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,564
# 我喜欢香草味 它是所有味道里 #
I like vanilla, it's the finest 

527
00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:35,360
# 最棒的 #
of the flavors.
