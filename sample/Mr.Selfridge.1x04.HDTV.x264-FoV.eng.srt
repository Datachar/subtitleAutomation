1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:03,863
I just want a chance to make it up
to you and George.

3
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,103
I don't remember you
ever being sober.

4
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:09,863
Lost a bit of money. My money.

5
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:12,485
It's a fine thing that Ellen Love
drops into the store.

6
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:14,125
She encourages people to buy.

7
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:16,565
Maintain a professional
relationship with her.

8
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:20,245
Buying up the store on his credit.
People are talking.

9
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:22,885
He's installed Miss Love in a flat.

10
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:25,725
I'm Roderick Temple, I'm a painter.
Why don't you paint me?

11
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,285
But I thought we were having lunch.
Not today.

12
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,125
I hope you're wrong, Mr Grove.

13
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:50,285
Miss Bunting, a moment.

14
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:55,645
Miss Mardle, your assistance,
please.

15
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:58,885
Is something wrong, Mr Grove?
Mr Selfridge?

16
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:05,405
Miss Mardle, the hem of
Miss Bunting's skirts, please.

17
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:20,565
Please say it isn't true.

18
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:35,045
Miss Bunting,
this is our best lace and silk.

19
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:38,765
I'm so sorry, Mr Selfridge.

20
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:41,925
Consider that sorry and fired.

21
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:44,965
I-I-I was going to pay for
everything, just as soon as my -

22
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,805
You were one of the first people
that I hired.

23
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:51,325
You don't steal from your work
family.

24
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:54,685
It's a betrayal of everything
that we stand for.

25
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:57,925
Don't you see that? Don't you see
that? Yes.

26
00:01:57,965 --> 00:01:59,565
I...

27
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:03,165
Increase random checks of all
departments, starting tomorrow.

28
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:05,205
I hate this. I hate it!

29
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:09,645
I-I'm all on my own with an invalid
mother, Mr Grove.

30
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:13,365
How am I to get another position,
without a reference?

31
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:18,085
Mr Selfridge takes theft very
personally, Miss Bunting.

32
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:22,445
He also takes staff problems very
personally.

33
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:25,445
Why on earth didn't you come to us?

34
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:30,765
I was too ashamed, Mr Grove.

35
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:38,565
Collect your things.

36
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:55,485
If you could get back to me...
Yes, that would be kind.

37
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:57,525
Yes, indeed.

38
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:01,885
Another hand-delivered card from
Miss Love, sir.

39
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:04,685
Make some time for Mr Grove to see
me, tomorrow.

40
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07,845
We need to see about a replacement
for Miss Bunting.

41
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:11,085
Miss Bunting's being replaced?
Anyone can be replaced.

42
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,125
Good night, Miss Blenkinsop.

43
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:55,809
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

44
00:03:57,765 --> 00:04:00,245
Smells nice. Yeah, it looks nice.

45
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:06,445
Could you butter me a little bit of
bread? Yeah.

46
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:15,565
Aggie?

47
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:19,845
Mrs Payne must have left the front
door open. Agnes, come on, girl.

48
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,805
Well, he can't get in, can he?
The locks have been changed.

49
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,845
Hello?

50
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:29,405
Agnes, you can't do this. We're a
family.

51
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:33,165
I'm out on the streets.

52
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:35,405
I don't have two brass farthings.

53
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:37,765
Hey, eat it up, George, while it's
hot. Agnes?

54
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:39,805
I need to talk to you.

55
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:46,765
Agnes, open the door!

56
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:51,845
George, are you in there?
George, it's all right.

57
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,125
Agnes, I'm warning you.

58
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:57,165
Open the door!

59
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:59,205
This mutton's lovely.

60
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:02,045
And the dumplings turned out well.

61
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,525
Agnes!

62
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:07,485
See that the car is waiting for us,
Fraser, thank you.

63
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:25,205
Pa! Where are we going, anyway?
What's the big secret?

64
00:06:57,725 --> 00:07:00,005
Pavlova so close I could touch her.

65
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:03,605
Thank you, Harry. A true gift.

66
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,605
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

67
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:11,245
Bravo.

68
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:15,005
Woo!

69
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:18,765
Oh, Frank.

70
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:24,245
Her performance was so beautiful.

71
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:26,485
She was so enchanting.

72
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:29,765
I did cry. Did you? Yes.

73
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:33,085
Beatrice would have loved this.
I wish she could've been here.

74
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,165
How beautiful you look tonight, my
dear.

75
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,805
Thank you, Lady Loxley.

76
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:40,645
I've never seen Rosalie at such a
loss for words.

77
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:42,685
Rosalie. Pa!

78
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:47,685
I like the young - fresh and
untainted,

79
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:49,965
before the world gets hold of them.

80
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:53,605
But I suspect Rosalie will be safe
from that corruption,

81
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:55,445
you'll see to that.

82
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:58,445
Mr Selfridge, have we won you over
to the charms of the ballet?

83
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:01,565
The look on my wife's face would've
won me over to anything.

84
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:04,885
I've never seen you so enchanted.

85
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:06,925
What struck you so?

86
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:13,405
I don't know. Well, it was like a
moment of perfect beauty,

87
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,845
where everything
just came together.

88
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:19,685
I just wish everyone could enjoy
this.

89
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:23,605
You are an idealist, my dear Mrs
Selfridge.

90
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:27,725
Only the very select can enjoy such
a gift. No, I disagree.

91
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:30,965
I think every woman should have
a Pavlova moment, like this.

92
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:33,445
Ladies and gentlemen,
Madame Pavlova.

93
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:35,485
There she is.

94
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:40,325
My dear...

95
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,325
Bravo, Miss Pavlova, you were truly
amazing.

96
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:49,325
We Americans like to show our
enthusiasm, freely.

97
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:51,805
Stunning, beyond words. You are too
kind.

98
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:55,885
Thank you for coming so swiftly,
Frank.

99
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:58,525
A girl likes to know that she can
still summon a gentleman

100
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:00,165
at the click of her fingers.

101
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,485
Not even a click, Miss Love, not
even that.

102
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:09,285
So... do you have plans after the
show? Huh?

103
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,565
I thought, perhaps, you and I...

104
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:14,405
I want you to find out what's going
on with Harry. Oh.

105
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:16,445
What do you mean?

106
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:19,045
He doesn't come near me.

107
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:21,485
He won't take my telephone calls.

108
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:23,325
He doesn't respond to my notes.

109
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:25,405
Is there anything I need to know,
Frank?

110
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:27,125
Not that I'm aware of, Ellen, dear.

111
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,965
You know Harry, he's his own man.

112
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,725
He's my man.

113
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:32,765
Look.

114
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:36,245
Look at the things he's given me.

115
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:40,685
Anything. 'Anything I want,'
that's what he said.

116
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:42,725
Well, he's a very generous chap.

117
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:45,565
Generous? Are you blind?

118
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:47,605
Have you seen my apartment?

119
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:49,885
The best of everything.

120
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:54,485
That's not generosity, that's -
that's a man putting down roots.

121
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:56,125
Roots?

122
00:09:56,165 --> 00:09:58,165
Ellen, I hope you're not...

123
00:09:58,205 --> 00:09:59,925
Surely you don't think...

124
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:01,965
Why not?

125
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:04,005
Lady Loxley was a Gaiety girl.

126
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:06,445
She nabbed Lord Loxley.

127
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:09,885
I'm sure that Harry has the same
intentions for me.

128
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:14,445
He... just needs reminding, that's
all.

129
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:18,805
That's all.

130
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:20,845
Just reminding.

131
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:25,805
Mm.

132
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:28,085
Look. Oh, my dear girl.

133
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:58,165
You didn't slide down, you fell
right off the horse.

134
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:00,885
Actually, it was more of a pony, a
small pony.

135
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:04,365
You're such a liar, Violette.
It was huge. I didn't fall.

136
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:07,125
I thrashed you - Gordon, Violette,
enough!

137
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,565
Beatrice, please, poppet. Just a
little more egg.

138
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,845
Rosalie isn't telling enough.

139
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,565
You do know I'm going to be a
ballerina, don't you?

140
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:19,565
I thought you were going to be in
variety shows, like Ellen Love?

141
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:22,805
Couldn't I do both? You could do
anything you set your mind to.

142
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:26,045
Come on, she's a girl. Who beat you
at arm wrestling the last 10 times?

143
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,365
You two!
Can I please eat my breakfast?

144
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:30,005
Good morning. Mama!

145
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:31,845
Mama, was she beautiful?

146
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:34,085
Did you cry? Yes and yes.

147
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,325
Rosalie, didn't you tell
your sister all about Pavlova?

148
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:41,725
How do you explain female
perfection to an over-eager puppy?

149
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:45,285
Well, all puppies have to learn, I
suppose.

150
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:48,645
Best they don't pick up bad habits
from the beginning, though,

151
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,685
hey, Rosalie?

152
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:53,125
I should die if I could meet Anna
Pavlova.

153
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:56,765
I might have to cancel a certain
arrangement, then. What a shame.

154
00:11:56,805 --> 00:12:00,765
You don't mean - I could mean
something. I could mean nothing.

155
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:04,445
Oh, Papa,
40 kisses every day for a week.

156
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:07,165
20 in the morning,
and 20 before bed.

157
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:10,285
Impressive arithmetic.

158
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:13,605
I tell you what, you make it
50 kisses and you've got a deal.

159
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:17,605
Good morning, everyone.
Morning. Good morning.

160
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:19,605
She'll be coming to the store
tomorrow

161
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:22,005
and you'll all get a chance to meet
her.

162
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:25,365
You, dear Rose, will have afternoon
tea with her.

163
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:27,405
Oh, my! Who loves me?

164
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:29,445
Who the heck in this room loves me?

165
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:31,605
We do.

166
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,005
Neaten the brooches.

167
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:40,485
I'd like to see your best inset
collars, please.

168
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:43,325
Finest gauze with a pearl motif,
preferably.

169
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:46,765
We're not open yet, madam.

170
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:50,885
I'm not a client, or I wouldn't be
here before doors opening.

171
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:53,765
White and a silvery grey, if you
please.

172
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,245
What do you want them for, madam?

173
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:59,565
For the decolletage on the
mannequins, of course.

174
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,125
You have to check with Miss Mardle,
Head of Accessories.

175
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:05,085
I will, send her to me. Now,
collars, please.

176
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,445
Did you see that, Doris?

177
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:25,805
Her skirts are around her ankles.

178
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:07,685
That motor van you're loading...

179
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:10,125
I don't see the Selfridges livery
on the side.

180
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,725
How often does it come? Mornings,
sometimes.

181
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:17,765
It'll be back around three, today.

182
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:20,925
It's always you that loads it?
I do what Alf and Sam tell me.

183
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:24,125
What are you getting out of it? Eh?

184
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,325
My wage, of course.

185
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:29,365
What else should I be getting?

186
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,685
Miss Irene Ravillious.

187
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:42,685
London-trained at
the House of Lucile, no less.

188
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,925
Our new visionary Head of Fashion.

189
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:48,085
Liberty's loss
is very much our gain.

190
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:52,965
She'll breathe new life into our
fashion department.

191
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,005
Isn't that right, Miss Ravillious?
Well -

192
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:56,807
In fact, she's so confident,

193
00:15:56,847 --> 00:16:00,447
that women's fashion might even
surpass accessories one day.

194
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:04,167
Are you asking me, or telling me,
Mr Selfridge?

195
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:09,327
A little bit of both, I guess.
That would be acceptable.

196
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:13,287
So I'd even go so far as to predict
that, within my lifetime certainly,

197
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:16,327
it won't just be the men who can
purchase ready-made for purpose,

198
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:18,367
but also the ladies.

199
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:20,407
What do you mean?

200
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:25,007
A lady shall enter our store,
see a costume, say, 'I want that,'

201
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:26,647
and purchase the very day.

202
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:29,927
No fittings, no seamstress,
no waiting about.

203
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:33,567
All well and good, Miss Ravillious,
but surely ladies tend to...

204
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:37,047
..tend to...

205
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:41,447
..tend to...
Tend to what, Mr Crabb?

206
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,047
Shapes and sizes, Mr Selfridge.

207
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:48,367
Precisely the point, Mr Crabb.

208
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,127
We shall stock all shapes and sizes.

209
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,167
Fashion will be big one day.

210
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:55,527
Mark my words, it's just a matter of
time.

211
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:59,287
Meanwhile, I have a great event
planned.

212
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,447
Anna Pavlova, any of you heard of
her?

213
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,287
Indeed. Yes.

214
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:05,567
She will be on our shop floor.

215
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,727
Surely not? Yes, Miss Mardle.

216
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:11,167
The beautiful and unique Pavlova
will be on our store floor,

217
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:14,487
for all to share -
from a Duchess to a lady's maid.

218
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:16,807
An experience
they'll always remember.

219
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:19,527
She'll mingle, Mr Selfridge?
You bet she'll mingle.

220
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:21,567
I'm gonna pay her handsomely,
I might add.

221
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,367
Every woman should have a Pavlova
moment.

222
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:28,287
Meeting adjourned. Back to
your posts with vim and vigour.

223
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:30,327
Thank you all.

224
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:35,847
I can't help but notice that your
skirt is shorter than the usual.

225
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,487
Is this the coming fashion?

226
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:41,527
My skirts are shorter because I'm a
champion of the Rational Dress
Movement. The what?

227
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:44,967
I believe clothes can serve a
purpose other than mere drapery.

228
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:46,607
I use my bicycle to get about,

229
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:49,247
consequently my skirts hang an inch
or two above the norm.

230
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:52,167
And I don't bother with whalebone
corseting - too restricting.

231
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:54,887
Vigorous exercise is sufficient to
keep my figure intact.

232
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:58,167
You are entitled to your ways, of
course, Miss Ravillious,

233
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,367
but may I advise you on our way in
the store,

234
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:03,327
with regard to taking stock from
one department for another -

235
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:07,207
Thank you, but I use my initiative,
as the staff manual decrees.

236
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:20,927
Day's not ripe, don't mind if I do.

237
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:24,127
I'm an upside-down creature, Frank.

238
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,167
Day's my night, night's my day.

239
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,207
You're a delectable, upside-down
creature. Cheers.

240
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,687
I take it you've spoken to Harry?

241
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:36,887
Is he coming to see me, today?

242
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,927
I shouldn't think today.

243
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:42,367
He's gonna be very busy.

244
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:45,887
Oh, no, red stuff's my poison.
Thanks all the same.

245
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:48,727
Why today in particular, Frank?

246
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,967
Who is she?

247
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:57,007
Who? Who, Frank? I'm sure it's just
business.

248
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:59,047
That's why we press...

249
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:02,487
Anna Pavlova is
visiting Selfridges, today.

250
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,527
THE Anna Pavlova?

251
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:08,847
I see.

252
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:11,407
My dear, you know what men like
Selfridge are like.

253
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:14,127
He's always in hot pursuit of the
next big thing.

254
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:17,207
Take my advice
and leave well alone.

255
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:19,967
She'll be gone like a puff of air
and I'm sure he'll be -

256
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,327
I am the Spirit of Selfridges,
Frank. Ellen -

257
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:24,287
How can I not be there to welcome
Pavlova?

258
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:27,167
I have to be there. Oh!

259
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,207
Just go, Frank!

260
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:35,727
How much longer?

261
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,927
I'm about to drop off.

262
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:44,487
Just hold the pose, just another
while.

263
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,247
I get the message.

264
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:01,007
I'm being greedy. That's enough for
today.

265
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:09,847
You know, it's such a rare quality,

266
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:12,567
a woman so comfortable in her own
skin.

267
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:14,847
I'm American, maybe that's it.

268
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:18,687
No.

269
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:20,727
No, that's not it.

270
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,087
So when I can see - Ah-ah-ah!

271
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:32,727
When it's ready for showing at the
Chelsea Arts Club.

272
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,167
I was hoping to buy it as a gift
for my husband.

273
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:43,367
Come with me to the club, Rose.
You'd love it there.

274
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:46,647
There are some amazing paintings.
Now? No, no, I can't.

275
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:50,127
Some amazing paintings -
No, really, I can't.

276
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,167
We'll take our entrance from here.

277
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:54,887
We will have a great deal of press
in this area.

278
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,887
Have as many people gathered here,

279
00:20:57,927 --> 00:21:01,127
just beyond a roped off area,
right here.

280
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:06,407
- All set for Pavlova's arrival?
- Yes, Mr Selfridge.

281
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,367
Miss Ravillious? Yes, Mr Selfridge?

282
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:12,527
We must make the most of her
presence. Sales-wise, you mean?

283
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:15,527
So it's not just about giving women
a moment to remember?

284
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,247
Business is about giving people what
they want.

285
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:22,687
That's what keeps over 2,000 staff
employed.

286
00:21:22,727 --> 00:21:26,367
The more people purchase, the more
memories. Simple commerce.

287
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:28,487
I am open to all of
your suggestions.

288
00:21:28,527 --> 00:21:31,047
Please feel free to use your
imaginations

289
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:34,007
and both departments working
together.

290
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:37,687
I welcome all of your ideas as soon
as possible.

291
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:39,727
Thank you very much.

292
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:52,207
Don't give Miss Ravillious anything
from accessories, unless I say so.

293
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:55,527
Is that understood? Yes, Miss
Mardle. Sorry, Miss Mardle.

294
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:58,247
Now, you heard Mr Selfridge,
any ideas, ladies,

295
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:01,767
before Miss Ravillious gets in
there first and shows us up...

296
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:07,567
Great idea, Miss Ravillious.

297
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:11,327
All we have to do is add the white
braiding to our existing capes.

298
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:14,527
See? How quickly can this be done?

299
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,367
I'll get the seamstresses to do
what they can today

300
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:20,567
then, if they sell, we can put them
on shifts through the night

301
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,727
to be ready for tomorrow.
Excellent.

302
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:26,567
Good idea. Have my wife's initials
sewn into the cape.

303
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:29,087
I cannot wait to see her face.

304
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:37,727
Come.

305
00:22:41,687 --> 00:22:44,967
I got them, Roger,
those tickets for Drury Lane.

306
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:48,447
Oh.

307
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:50,807
Josie, I'm so sorry.

308
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:54,127
Oh, no. Please don't say you can't
come.

309
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:57,287
Hettie's nurse asked for the night
off. I completely forgot.

310
00:22:57,327 --> 00:23:00,487
Let me pay for them. Take a friend
instead.

311
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:02,527
It was my treat.

312
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:04,567
Another time, perhaps.

313
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:08,407
Oh, and while I'm here,

314
00:23:08,447 --> 00:23:12,207
Miss Ravillious needs to know she
can't pinch from other departments.

315
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:14,447
You may find that

316
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:17,407
she is looking for white braiding
from accessories.

317
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:20,087
An idea she's putting to Mr
Selfridge as we speak.

318
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:23,567
From my department? And she didn't
ask me to go and see him with her?

319
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:33,487
It even goes with that, I think.
Mm-hm.

320
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:41,567
Victor?

321
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:49,487
Your George - you might wanna ask
him about the vans he loads.

322
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:51,967
Well, how do you mean?
Well, just that.

323
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:54,367
Just check
he knows what he's doing, is all.

324
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:56,407
What do we think, Miss Towler?

325
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:59,007
Which ribbon for rose buds? Hm?

326
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:02,967
White, Mr Leclair. I agree.

327
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:05,767
Thank you, girls.
You're welcome, Mr Leclair.

328
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:07,807
Can we make a start?

329
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:12,607
Yes, Mr Leclair. Good.

330
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,327
Miss Mardle, with your permission,

331
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,727
I'd like to move Miss Towler to the
fashion department for today.

332
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:22,887
By all means, Mr Leclair. Move all
of accessories, why don't you?

333
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,807
It's the way things are heading,
as far as I can see.

334
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:27,847
Only Miss Towler. Thank you.

335
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,847
Why not one of us?

336
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:37,607
She's no better than you or me. Hm.

337
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,367
Sometimes, I think I'll turn into a
boring chicken.

338
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:51,287
Cluck-cluck.

339
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:53,727
Wouldn't that be amusing, Mr
Colleano?

340
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:55,927
Let me add some flavour, Lady
Loxley.

341
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:00,207
Something original.

342
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:02,247
Of course, Lady Loxley.

343
00:25:04,527 --> 00:25:07,407
Ah, Lady Mae, always a pleasure to
see you.

344
00:25:07,447 --> 00:25:10,607
Quite a coup you've pulled off, Mr
Selfridge.

345
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:12,647
Pavlova in a shop.

346
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:14,687
This shop.

347
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:18,847
Actually, she's having tea with Rose
at 3:30, if you wanna join them.

348
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,487
I certainly would.

349
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:23,247
Your wife's company grows on me
with each encounter.

350
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:25,487
Me too.

351
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,167
How dare you speak about my beloved
Rossetti like that.

352
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:31,967
His paintings make me swoon.

353
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,967
Because they're overblown,
sentimental tosh. Here, here.

354
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,287
Do I get a kiss every time you
disagree with me?

355
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:40,007
Come on, Cora, kiss him.

356
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:42,927
Mrs Buckingham, is your husband a
patron of the arts also?

357
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:44,887
In a manner of speaking, yes.

358
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:48,407
Buckingham? Buckingham?

359
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:52,887
I can't say I know any other
American involved in that circle.

360
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,927
Anyone else?

361
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,887
The Buckinghams, they're relatively
new to London.

362
00:25:57,927 --> 00:26:00,567
I'm so sorry, I really am running
rather late.

363
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:02,207
Oh!

364
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:05,927
But thank you so much. I'm sorry,
but I'm so late -

365
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:07,807
Tell us everything.

366
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:11,047
Has your husband commissioned
paintings of you before? Tell us.

367
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:18,847
Victor, what do you think you're
playing at?

368
00:26:18,887 --> 00:26:20,887
Satisfying the lady, Mr Perez.

369
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:30,007
Gentleman's relish and a typical
Italian touch.

370
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,247
Chopped olives and capers. Mm.

371
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,447
You have an inspired touch, Mr
Colleano.

372
00:26:43,487 --> 00:26:45,567
I look forward to tasting more from
you.

373
00:26:45,607 --> 00:26:47,447
Any time you say, Lady Loxley.

374
00:26:47,487 --> 00:26:49,687
I say in a couple of hours,
Mr Colleano.

375
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:56,607
Do let me know when Mrs Selfridge
arrives, I'm taking tea with her...

376
00:26:57,767 --> 00:27:00,287
..which sadly means I shall have to
reserve my appetite

377
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,447
for any more of your creative
touches.

378
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:12,367
Still, the pleasure is in the
anticipation.

379
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:16,367
Don't you think? I can't rightly
say, Lady Loxley.

380
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:18,407
I like to eat when I'm hungry.

381
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,527
Welcome.

382
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:40,287
Beautiful. Good to see you.
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

383
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,327
Gentlemen...

384
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,916
Such beautiful emeralds.

385
00:28:19,956 --> 00:28:22,276
The finest, madam, from Columbia,

386
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:26,263
mounted on white gold and fashioned
by our designers in Hatton Garden.

387
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:28,303
Ooh!

388
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:33,263
A child in a confectionery store is
what you make of me, Mr Selfridge.

389
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:35,423
I like to spoil ladies,
Miss Pavlova.

390
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:39,543
Your presence and pleasure suit the
image we want to convey.

391
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:46,263
So how shall we transport all these
perfumes, lotions and petticoats?

392
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:48,303
Do we have enough items of luggage?

393
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:53,213
Spasibo.

394
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:58,733
Oh!

395
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:01,133
Ladies fashion, perhaps?

396
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,173
Oh, yes, please.

397
00:29:13,013 --> 00:29:15,733
Where would you like us?
Just there, please.

398
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:22,773
I love her dress.

399
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:30,093
Oh, she's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen in my life.

400
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:33,693
Don't you think, Kitty? Second only
to those jewels round her neck.

401
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:35,733
Wherever could your mother be?

402
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:38,493
Well, if Ma's not going, I'm not
either.

403
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:40,653
Maybe Ma's waiting for us there.

404
00:29:40,693 --> 00:29:42,893
I'm surprised
she hasn't telephoned.

405
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:45,773
You are coming to.
Right, then. Off we go.

406
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:48,893
Goodbye.

407
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:56,493
Thank you for
a wonderful afternoon.

408
00:29:56,533 --> 00:30:00,333
Mrs Buckingham, you simply cannot
miss what we are going to see.

409
00:30:00,373 --> 00:30:02,813
It's history in the making. She's
right.

410
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:06,133
I can't, I really can't.
Help me, everybody.

411
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:09,293
We're going to have manhandle
Mrs Buckingham all the way there.

412
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:12,293
No, no, no. Tell her, Roddy. Tell
her.

413
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,333
Very well.

414
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:16,733
We're going to see Pavlova in the
flesh.

415
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:20,613
See? I told you you'd thank me.

416
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,653
Kidnap the lady, my friends.

417
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:24,693
No. No, Roddy! Roddy, a word.

418
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:28,613
Go ahead. Go ahead, we'll catch up.

419
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:32,333
Is everything OK?

420
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:35,093
What is it?

421
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,893
Why wouldn't you want to come to
the biggest event in town?

422
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:40,093
Because I'm supposed to be there
already.

423
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,173
I'm Mrs Selfridge.

424
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:17,413
They're not here for very long,
so get 'em while you can.

425
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:19,453
Follow me, Miss Pavlova.

426
00:32:19,493 --> 00:32:21,693
Oh, my family's here. Excuse me.

427
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,733
There they are.

428
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:25,613
Hi, Mom.

429
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,773
Where's Rose?
I thought she'd be here.

430
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,513
No.

431
00:32:29,526 --> 00:32:31,526
Come meet Miss Pavlova.

432
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:34,686
Miss Pavlova, this is my mother,
Madam Selfridge.

433
00:32:34,726 --> 00:32:37,766
How do you do? Anna Pavlova...

434
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:41,486
I say, she's every bit as perfect
as the chief said.

435
00:32:43,446 --> 00:32:45,446
Some night this week, Roger, yes?

436
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:48,726
Depends, my dear. Some of
the nurses do require supervision.

437
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:52,046
It is really about the nurses
though, isn't it? It's not me.

438
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:53,886
Of course not.

439
00:32:54,926 --> 00:32:57,406
We can't talk now, Josie, you know
that. Yes.

440
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:05,246
It was wrong, I should've just told
you the truth.

441
00:33:05,286 --> 00:33:07,286
Yes, you should've.

442
00:33:07,326 --> 00:33:10,886
It's just... everybody know the
Selfridge name and I just...

443
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:15,526
I guess, I just wanted to have
something that was, well, my own.

444
00:33:17,646 --> 00:33:19,646
Do you know, my father's right?

445
00:33:19,686 --> 00:33:22,446
I am an idiot. Oh, don't say that.

446
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:25,246
No, I am. You're so kind and
talented. Kind and talented?

447
00:33:25,286 --> 00:33:28,806
I love our time together. Please,
say we can still be friends.

448
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:31,846
Friends? Yes.

449
00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:35,726
It's no match for the famous Mr
Selfridge though, is it?

450
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:38,206
You knew I was falling in love with
you.

451
00:33:38,246 --> 00:33:41,326
What was it? What? Was it revenge
for Ellen Love? Was that it?

452
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:45,086
Half of London knows, don't tell me
you don't.

453
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:48,126
Harry and I have our bond.

454
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,166
How could he risk losing you?

455
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:53,486
It's in his nature, he risks the
things that he loves.

456
00:33:55,086 --> 00:33:57,566
And it's my nature
to remain in love with me.

457
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:01,166
I should go.

458
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,206
Rose, please.

459
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:07,926
Ellen Love, I didn't...

460
00:34:09,126 --> 00:34:11,126
Please, forgive me.

461
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,166
I was tempted, Roddy.

462
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,686
I owe you that much honesty, at
least.

463
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:29,406
Gentlemen, it's Miss Love.

464
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:31,766
Miss Love, this way. Miss Love.

465
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:34,206
Over here, Miss Love, and a nice,
big smile.

466
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:35,886
Over here, please, Miss Love.

467
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:38,206
Now, are you sure this is a good
idea?

468
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:40,246
Don't be silly, Frank.

469
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:45,806
Mr Selfridge.

470
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:48,566
Miss Pavlova, I had to come and see
you.

471
00:34:48,606 --> 00:34:52,206
Ellen Love, the Spirit of
Selfridges.

472
00:34:52,246 --> 00:34:54,246
I don't think I...

473
00:34:54,286 --> 00:34:56,766
Do you dance, Miss Love?

474
00:34:56,806 --> 00:34:59,126
Oh, I surely do. What fun.

475
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,406
Another dancer, Mr Selfridge.

476
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:05,166
Miss Love is of a contemporary
variety. Doris. Doris, look.

477
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:07,766
I'm fascinated by this new dance
movement in Europe.

478
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,806
I visited the Isadora Duncan School
in Paris.

479
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:12,606
It was quite extraordinary.

480
00:35:12,646 --> 00:35:16,126
Or do you favour this more modern,
Bohemian style?

481
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,686
Miss Love sings as well as dances.

482
00:35:18,726 --> 00:35:21,086
Don't you, Miss Love? Yes.

483
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:23,566
It's so very kind of you to welcome
Miss Pavlova,

484
00:35:23,606 --> 00:35:26,166
but we can't keep you any longer,
Miss Love, please.

485
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:28,486
Oh, no. No!

486
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:32,406
Not at all. I have to a photograph
with Miss Pavlova.

487
00:35:32,446 --> 00:35:34,446
Miss Pavlova.

488
00:35:34,486 --> 00:35:37,646
Good publicity.
So sorry about this, Harry.

489
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:39,686
Coo-ee, boys! Over here!

490
00:35:39,726 --> 00:35:42,446
Dad... A little Champagne?

491
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:45,246
I'm a customer. Please, Dad.

492
00:35:45,286 --> 00:35:48,046
I've come in to do some shopping.
Dad, people are...

493
00:35:49,726 --> 00:35:51,726
You boys do make me smile.

494
00:35:51,766 --> 00:35:55,166
Beauty and elegance,
that's what the store is all about.

495
00:35:55,206 --> 00:35:56,806
Please - You're a shop girl!

496
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,446
Get that drunk out of our store.
Yes, sir.

497
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:12,046
You bitch! You should be ashamed of
yourself.

498
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,446
I'm your father, anyhow.

499
00:36:14,486 --> 00:36:16,486
You little bitch.

500
00:36:16,526 --> 00:36:18,126
Happy now?

501
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:23,966
Thank you, boys. That's enough.

502
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:32,886
Ellen, with me, now, please.

503
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:35,526
Mother, will you take the children
to the restaurant?

504
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:38,926
Come along, children. Go ahead,
we'll see you soon.

505
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:41,286
Aggie!

506
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:46,286
Aggie! Agnes, you call this urchin
off me, or you'll be sorry, girl.

507
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:48,926
Will you please just go?

508
00:36:50,286 --> 00:36:52,286
Lost your job, have you?

509
00:36:52,326 --> 00:36:55,966
See, you're no better than me, my
girl.

510
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,606
You and that stupid, little chump.

511
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:01,486
You're right. You've ruined
everything.

512
00:37:01,526 --> 00:37:04,646
You've done your damage, now what
more do you want?

513
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:07,686
I want...

514
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,646
I want some respect from my own
flesh and blood.

515
00:37:14,006 --> 00:37:16,286
I will never respect you.

516
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:18,326
I hate you.

517
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,646
Now get out of here.

518
00:37:41,486 --> 00:37:44,846
Your Pa is the reason you didn't
want me coming round your place.

519
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:48,326
I thought it was me.

520
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:54,246
It'll be all right, Agnes.

521
00:37:55,966 --> 00:37:57,966
No, it won't, Victor.

522
00:37:58,006 --> 00:38:00,326
He'll keep coming back.

523
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,446
Miss Bunting got sacked for a lot
less.

524
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:07,006
Go to him. Explain.

525
00:38:07,046 --> 00:38:09,046
Mr Selfridge'll understand.

526
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:13,926
How could he understand what it's
like to have a father like that?

527
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:15,966
He'll think I'm scum.

528
00:38:16,006 --> 00:38:18,006
Hey.

529
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,246
No-one would ever think that about
you.

530
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,086
I'll look after you, Agnes.

531
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:29,326
Honest, I will.

532
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,726
You've got your own family to look
after, Victor...

533
00:38:39,806 --> 00:38:41,806
..but thank you.

534
00:38:50,966 --> 00:38:54,766
Oi! Walk your sister upstairs
is what you need to do -

535
00:38:54,806 --> 00:38:58,286
But I have to - ..or there'll be
two of you looking for a job.

536
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:08,797
And to show you the extent of our
gratitude to Miss Pavlova,

537
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,620
we have one more gift to bestow.

538
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,300
What could it be, Sonya? I can't
imagine, Madame.

539
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,060
You were saying about
a new sable...

540
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,260
You shall have a new sable too.

541
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,620
And there is more? Ah, yes.

542
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,020
The most prestigious gift our store
could offer.

543
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,060
Your very own window.

544
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
I think a photo is in order.

545
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,700
You've given her a window?
Keep your voice down.

546
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,820
Please - But, Harry - Let's get you
out of here, Ellen, right now.

547
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,500
Will you call on me, this evening?

548
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,860
Listen, your contract with
Selfridges is over.

549
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,780
All right? Come on. Harry.

550
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,940
Harry, why would you say that?
You've crossed the line.

551
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,340
My family is here.
I don't see your wife anywhere.

552
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,300
My wife is not your concern. The
point is, your reckless nature.

553
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,020
Please, Harry. Please don't leave
me. Please, Harry.

554
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,820
You can keep the flat and whatever
you want. Goodbye, Ellen.

555
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,220
I'm sorry. No. Frank, take her home,
please. Please.

556
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,260
I'm sorry.

557
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,380
Come on, Ellen.

558
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,420
Come on, dear.

559
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,380
Henri? Would you excuse me?

560
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,220
I wanna talk to you about Miss
Pavlova's window.

561
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,260
Indeed, Mr Selfridge.

562
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,420
I know exactly what I want and I'm
gonna work on it with you myself.

563
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,860
I want it to be the talk of London
and I need it on display -

564
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,620
Let me guess, this evening?

565
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,660
Exactly.

566
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,340
Now, if anyone could tell me
where the hell Rose is...

567
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,980
I'm sure you will love it.

568
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Mom? Where's Mom?

569
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,540
Thank you, Fraser.

570
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,580
Mom!

571
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,820
I danced with Anna Pavlova.

572
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,620
Lady Mae clapped her hands off.

573
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,020
I brought you a Pavlova cape
with your initials on it.

574
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,620
Where were you, Ma? Have you any
idea what you've missed? I do.

575
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,420
I'm sorry, everyone,
I wasn't feeling very well.

576
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,180
Right, everyone get ready
for dinner, please.

577
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,540
Better now, Mama? I'm much better.

578
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,180
Thank you.

579
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,220
Come on, dear.

580
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,460
Should I be worried? No, no, I'm
feeling... I'm much better.

581
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,540
You must have been feeling very bad
to miss tea with Pavlova.

582
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,500
I appreciate your arranging that
for me, Harry...

583
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,460
..but I couldn't make it.

584
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,100
From the shop you love,
on Marylebone Street.

585
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,180
Violet creams. Your favourite.
Yeah.

586
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,380
And I've arranged to stay
the night, after all.

587
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,580
I'll get fat.

588
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
You're lovely.

589
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,260
Very lovely.

590
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
The window.

591
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,740
It's beautiful, Madame.

592
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,260
All in.

593
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,460
Are you sure, Harry, old chap?

594
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,060
Why aren't you at the store? I left.

595
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,700
Who the bloody hell are you?

596
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,860
I have certain conditions to put
before you.

597
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,500
I'm here to tell you

598
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,740
that your husband has not been
faithful to you.

599
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,260
Oh, no, you don't. We need to have
this out.

600
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,900
I'm meant to feel sorry for you?

601
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,060
Well, maybe I will tomorrow,
but tonight you can go to hell!

602
00:44:58,942 --> 00:45:17,013
