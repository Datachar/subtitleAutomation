1
00:00:00,757 --> 00:00:03,217
My name is Elena Gilbert.
I'm a vampire.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,819
â™ª

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,720
You're sired to me, Elena.
Everything you think you fell,

4
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:09,971
might not even be real.

5
00:00:09,972 --> 00:00:11,589
But there's
hope now.

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,873
Tell them what the hunter
told you the tattoo leads to.

7
00:00:12,874 --> 00:00:14,475
He said there was
a cure.

8
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:16,678
Everyone wants it
for a different reason.

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:17,896
For revenge...

10
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:19,186
Ohh!

11
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,183
To be human
an in love...

12
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:23,284
For the truth...

13
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:24,775
I'm setting you
free, Elena.

14
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:27,156
And some will
stop at nothing to get it.

15
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:28,740
Do it!

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,167
Carol Lockwood
always said that togetherness,

17
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,952
in times of tragedy,

18
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:43,738
leads to healing.

19
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,076
That one community is stronger
than a thousand of its members.

20
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:51,679
But how does a community
stay strong

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,914
after losing its leader?

22
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:57,518
And Carol was so much
more than just a mayor.

23
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:00,471
She was...

24
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:03,324
An open-minded friend...

25
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:07,278
And a concerned mother,

26
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,647
taken from us too soon

27
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:12,951
by a terrible accident.

28
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:16,537
Screw this.

29
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:18,286
Tyler.

30
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,291
Tyler.

31
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:26,113
Please join me in observing

32
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:28,213
a minute of silence
in her memory.

33
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:48,186
You ok?

34
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:50,805
I'll be right back.

35
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:54,125
Thank you very much.

36
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:57,578
In the wake of this tragedy, the
town has selected an interim mayor.

37
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:00,031
Many of you already know him.

38
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:02,039
Please welcome Mr. Rudy Hopkins.

39
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,714
Thank you, sheriff.

40
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:14,312
Carol Lockwood put
this town first,

41
00:02:14,313 --> 00:02:16,848
and that's why I'm here
to talk to you guys.

42
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:19,389
You folks...

43
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:37,324
April?

44
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:40,538
What's wrong?

45
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,374
Nothing. I'm fine.

46
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,248
But you're crying.

47
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:48,046
It's just the whole
mayor thing.

48
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:50,128
You know,
it's bringing up stuff with my dad.

49
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:53,799
And I know you're
a vampire.

50
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:57,719
Wait. What?

51
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:04,979
Oh, was that
necessary?

52
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,565
No, but it was fun.

53
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:13,250

<font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com/</font>

54
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,056
Hey, you just missed

55
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:17,658
the mandatory
all-school assembly.

56
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,893
Well, that's because I'm

57
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:21,299
at a mandatory all-alone
drinking party.

58
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,933
Seriously?
You decided to go

59
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:24,918
on a ripper
bender now?

60
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,720
My brother slept with Elena.

61
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:28,755
Kind of puts a little bit
of a damper on things.

62
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:31,024
First of all,
you are not supposed to know that.

63
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:34,928
Second of all, Tyler is already
spiraling, and he gets priority.

64
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:37,397
His mother just died.
What do you expect?

65
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:39,733
I'm his girlfriend.
I expect him to talk to me.

66
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:41,935
But instead he's all angry,
and it doesn't help that

67
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:43,937
everyone keeps referring to his
mother's death as an accident,

68
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:47,574
which is really just a polite
way of saying that she was drunk.

69
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:49,209
You think Klaus
killed her?

70
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,245
Well, I don't think
she drowned in a Martini glass.

71
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:56,449
Just get it together.
I can't do it alone.

72
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:11,515
The assembly's over.

73
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,350
What the hell's going on?

74
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:14,796
The school will
be empty soon.

75
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:18,688
How many times
did you compel me?

76
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:21,274
Don't...
Just don't lie.

77
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:23,160
Rebekah says
you lie.

78
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,828
Rebekah's not who you
think she is, April.

79
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,767
What, she's not a thousand-year-old
original vampire?

80
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,951
Listen, we can
figure this out, ok,

81
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:32,669
but we have
to get out of here.

82
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:37,027
Sorry.
Not allowed.

83
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,994
Why don't you
take a seat?

84
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:42,879
The rest of the class
will be here shortly.

85
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,835
First saved message.

86
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:50,854
Hey, it's me.

87
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:53,857
Look, I know
why you sent me away.

88
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:56,843
You think that what I'm feeling for
you is because of the sire bond,

89
00:04:56,844 --> 00:05:00,280
but I hate not being
near you.

90
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:10,123
Go ahead.
Make a move.

91
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:13,146
I drove up here to be your wingman,
not kick your ass.

92
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,487
Aah! Ok.

93
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,869
I get it.
I get it.

94
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,204
You're a badass.

95
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:30,760
You see that?

96
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:33,597
Couldn't miss it.
It was in slow motion.

97
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,398
Then teach me
something useful.

98
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,050
We've been here
for days, and so far

99
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:38,755
all you've done
is bark orders.

100
00:05:42,823 --> 00:05:44,511
Ok.

101
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,727
Take a seat at
the bench, quarterback.

102
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:49,562
Karate kid wts
a anot at the title.

103
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:52,102
Jeremy, you're
not ready for this.

104
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:55,814
Well?

105
00:05:57,672 --> 00:06:01,945
Now, all I have to do is apply
a little pressure under your jaw.

106
00:06:05,763 --> 00:06:07,931
Really? Again?

107
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:11,830
Ok.

108
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:15,388
Double pepperoni
3 days in a row.

109
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,307
You guys eat
anything else?

110
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:19,129
Why?
Are you offering?

111
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:21,978
A little something
extra, cut off

112
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,697
the pizza pipeline
for a couple days.

113
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:25,802
No matter how much they beg,
don't come back.

114
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:29,152
Sorry, guys.

115
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:30,453
You're gonna
starve us now?

116
00:06:30,454 --> 00:06:31,705
If that's what it takes

117
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:32,939
to make you a hunter.

118
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,992
Now run around
the lake, twice.

119
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:40,580
Keep him company.

120
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:42,465
I don't have
to listen to you.

121
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:44,070
You do
if you want to eat.

122
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:55,128
Being
near you, and I miss you, Damon.

123
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:57,167
I wish you would just
let me come to you.

124
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:03,403
What?

125
00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:04,854
Guess who.

126
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:06,639
I'm back, dagger-free,

127
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,974
and I'm holding Elena
hostage at the High School.

128
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:09,359
Just thought you should know.

129
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,610
Who the hell was
dumb enough

130
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:11,811
to pull that dagger
out of you?

131
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,830
I'll be asking
the questions today.

132
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:15,332
See ya soon.

133
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:28,044
I'm only ready to talk to you

134
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:30,575
if you're ready
to rejoin civilization.

135
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:34,517
How would you like to drive the white
oak stake through Rebekah's heart?

136
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:39,606
If it means you're not drinking your
way through the mystic grill, sure.

137
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:41,358
So...

138
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,393
First speech
under your belt.

139
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:45,895
Now for the fun part.

140
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:48,531
Welcome to the world
of careful cover-ups.

141
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:51,350
We've ruled Carol's death
as head trauma from a fall.

142
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:53,236
That's the official
autopsy.

143
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:55,688
She did not go
gently, did she?

144
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,240
Any leads?

145
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:58,908
We have ideas.

146
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,076
Let me guess.

147
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:01,878
Sharp teeth and bad
table manners?

148
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,997
You sure you want this?

149
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:06,666
I mean, 6 people were
offered this job before you.

150
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,385
They all said no
for a reason.

151
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:10,236
I'm saying yes
for a reason,

152
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,889
and my reason
just walked in.

153
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:16,760
I'll let you know what we find.
Thank you, sheriff.

154
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:19,345
Hey, sheriff.
Hey, dad.

155
00:08:19,346 --> 00:08:21,898
- Hey.
- So...

156
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,717
Far cry from being
a traveling pharmaceutical rep.

157
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:27,737
I noticed a few of your friends
missing from the assembly.

158
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:29,939
So much for mandatorat
I guess, huh?

159
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,908
Dad, stop it.

160
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:34,861
You can't come in here
and start making rules.

161
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:37,363
I think this town could
use a few more rules.

162
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,949
You're forgetting I can
help protect the town.

163
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,787
I am well aware
of your gifts, Bonnie...

164
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:45,939
But don't forget
I'm your father.

165
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,758
That means that I get
to protect you.

166
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:37,952
Hello, Stefan.

167
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:42,095
I'm here.
What do you want?

168
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:45,181
The same thing I wanted when
you helped make Klaus stab me.

169
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:46,850
The cure.

170
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:52,634
I hope you're not waiting for
Caroline to show up and stake me...

171
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:56,971
Because I already
found her.

172
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:08,818
Stefan.

173
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,443
Did I say
you could move?

174
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,707
Class is in session.

175
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,076
You've all been compelled.
You know the rules.

176
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:19,745
Answer my questions
honestly,

177
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:21,581
no disobedience,

178
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:22,865
no one leaves.

179
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,867
April, my sweet,
take notes.

180
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:26,793
This is how you get
answers in this town.

181
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:29,138
Let's start with
a little quiz.

182
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,708
In the year 1114, my brother
learned... thanks to yours truly...

183
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:35,377
About a brotherhood of
vampire hunters with tattoos

184
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:37,346
that grew with each kill.

185
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:40,733
And these tattoos
reveal what? Elena?

186
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:42,234
A map.

187
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:45,154
Which led to,
Caroline?

188
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:46,689
A cure for vampirism.

189
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,724
Perfect.
We're all caught up.

190
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,727
Stefan Salvatore, the last time
we saw each other,

191
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:54,730
you had a vampire hunter,
but in order to decode the map,

192
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:57,066
you needed the location
of the hunter's sword,

193
00:10:57,067 --> 00:11:01,454
which you got out of me
using some very dirty tricks.

194
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:04,090
Assuming you found the sword,
you must have found the cure,

195
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,542
and yet you're all
still vampires,

196
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:08,260
which means something
went wrong.

197
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:09,545
What are you doing?

198
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:12,598
You asked me
to take notes.

199
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,266
I wasn't being
literal, darling.

200
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:16,302
But now that you mention it,
a flow chart would be nice,

201
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:19,053
which means index cards
and push pins. Go fetch.

202
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:22,475
You're wasting
your time.

203
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:24,426
We don't know
anything.

204
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:26,445
So you just gave up?

205
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:29,148
I thought you'd do
anything to save Elena,

206
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:31,784
even if it meant taking
the cure yourself

207
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:33,693
so you could grow old
and die with her.

208
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,616
Why do you look
so surprised?

209
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:46,706
I'm missing something.
What is it?

210
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:50,752
They broke up, ok?

211
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:53,889
Now let us go.

212
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,465
Broke up?

213
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,811
Wait. I'm confused.

214
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:02,430
I thought Elena was
your epic love, Stefan.

215
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:06,736
I asked you what happened,

216
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:08,738
and you have to tell me.

217
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:10,980
She slept with Damon.

218
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:29,666
Good.

219
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:32,661
Now...

220
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:36,966
Now do it like your life
depends on it 'cause it does.

221
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,500
Don't act like you care
about my life.

222
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,335
You care about the hunter's
mark and curing Elena

223
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:42,304
so she's not sired
to your ass.

224
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:44,673
Both require you
to be alive,

225
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:49,344
which is why I've updated our relationship
status to "it's complicated."

226
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:53,532
You talked
to her at all?

227
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,184
Elena?

228
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:56,902
Maybe.

229
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:59,872
Why? Run out of
voicemails to listen to?

230
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:02,992
I'm sorry.
Did I interrupt play time?

231
00:13:02,993 --> 00:13:04,160
What the hell are
you doing here?

232
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:05,327
I'm simply
appreciating

233
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:07,329
the sights and
smells of nature,

234
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,165
neither of which
presently include

235
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,549
rotting
vampire flesh,

236
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,918
so I'm a bit
concerned.

237
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,970
How many vampires
has he killed?

238
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:18,374
If we throw Jeremy out into
the world right now, he's chum.

239
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,760
Now, see,
that's not a number.

240
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,762
12... that's
a number.

241
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:24,013
That's how many
of my hybrids

242
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:26,015
I slaughtered
with my sword.

243
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:28,184
3... that's how many
days it took

244
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:29,885
to quell the urge to
kill your brother, after

245
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:32,905
he knowingly watched
as I walked into a death trap.

246
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:34,240
One...

247
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:37,243
That's the number of
purposes you serve.

248
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:41,113
You are here to
grow Jeremy's mark,

249
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:44,083
so I ask again...

250
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:47,586
How many vampires has
he killed since he's been here?

251
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:49,738
Zero.

252
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:52,081
Hmm. That's a pity.

253
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,427
I'm going to need
that cure

254
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:57,746
sooner rather
than later,

255
00:13:57,747 --> 00:14:00,766
hybrid shortage
and all.

256
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,935
How can I help?

257
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:05,137
You know...

258
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:08,107
Now that you mention it,

259
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,309
Jeremy...
Watch and learn.

260
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:17,774
That's for Carol Lockwood.

261
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:26,325
So, vampire Elena is
a trollop who likes bad boys,

262
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:28,443
which explains why Stefan
reeks of alcohol.

263
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:33,632
But what it doesn't explain
is why sweet, loving,

264
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:38,888
innocent Elena could be
so heartless towards Stefan.

265
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:45,635
How could she hurt you
like that? Answer, please.

266
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,364
She didn't know it
at the time,

267
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:49,972
but she was sired to Damon.

268
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:55,971
A sire bond. Fascinating.

269
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,140
And what do you think
about that, Elena?

270
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:01,493
I think you're sad
and bored

271
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:04,146
and in desperate need
of a hobby.

272
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:07,482
You're hiding something.
'Fess up.

273
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:10,870
I didn't sleep with Damon
because of his sire bond.

274
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:13,204
I slept with Damon because
I'm in love with him.

275
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:28,553
What does any of this have
to do with the stupid cure?

276
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:32,725
You're right.
We got off the point.

277
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:35,694
Stefan, how do I
find the cure?

278
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:39,031
Unless you'd rather talk
about Damon and Elena all day.

279
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:41,317
There's a Professor.
He knows where the cure is.

280
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:45,287
Thank you. And, uh,
where do I find this Professor?

281
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:48,958
Oh, and so now I'm "gifted"?
He hates my witch heritage.

282
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,859
That's why he travels all the time.
He can't handle it.

283
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,579
And suddenly he wants to
be a protective father?

284
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,547
No. Not like this.

285
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:57,700
Come on. Distract me.

286
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:59,668
Isn't there some...

287
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:03,172
Magic therapy thing you
haven't shown me yet?

288
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:04,924
Listen, Bonnie, I hate
to tell you this...

289
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:06,508
Actually, you know what?
I take that back.

290
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,877
I'm proud
to tell you this.

291
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:10,312
You don't need
my help anymore.

292
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:12,263
In fact...

293
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:20,062
I was hoping to present this
with a cupcake or something.

294
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,067
Happy graduation.

295
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,417
It's beautiful.

296
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:33,669
It's human bone.
Oh.

297
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,921
Legend says it was worn

298
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:38,257
by the 2,000-year-old
witch Qetsiyah,

299
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,125
who drew on it...

300
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:41,743
For strength.

301
00:16:41,744 --> 00:16:45,747
Bonnie, you have come
so far so fast.

302
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:47,749
If you trust
my opinion,

303
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,717
your magic is exactly
where it needs to be.

304
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:52,938
Does this mean
I have to go home?

305
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:55,806
It means I got a stack of papers
I got to grade by tomorrow.

306
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,016
I can take a hint.

307
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:01,646
Thanks, Shane.

308
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:18,630
Oh, my God.

309
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:20,115
Kol.

310
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:23,584
Shane?

311
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:48,525
I told you I don't
want to talk.

312
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,844
I heard. You're
keeping all that rage

313
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:52,830
bottled up inside.

314
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:54,615
Caroline's worried
sick about you.

315
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,833
Rebekah?

316
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:57,418
Hello, Tyler.

317
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,421
I heard my brother made
a real mess of your life.

318
00:18:00,422 --> 00:18:04,174
Believe me, I can relate.
You have my condolences.

319
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:07,878
In fact, why don't you come down to the high
school so you can accept them in person?

320
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,079
And why would I
do that?

321
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,131
Because I have
your girlfriend.

322
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,427
Maybe you have a better shot at
saving her than you did your mother.

323
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,528
Sister...

324
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:25,879
Look at this.

325
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,881
You're even worse
than Klaus.

326
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,683
Kol. Finally.

327
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:31,485
Did you bring me
what I asked for?

328
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,243
You must be Shane.

329
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:51,388
If you're here
for payback, go for it.

330
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:54,558
But you'll be stuck baby-sitting
the little hunter that could.

331
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,877
You know...

332
00:18:56,878 --> 00:19:00,765
If you adjust your angle a little
bit, you'll find a sharper edge.

333
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:05,602
I know how
to whittle. Thanks.

334
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,571
Now I know why those
hybrids hated you.

335
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:08,906
You are annoying.

336
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:11,075
Actually,
I'm just perplexed

337
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:13,761
as to why Jeremy hasn't
killed any vampires.

338
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:15,312
Darwinism, Klaus.

339
00:19:15,313 --> 00:19:16,914
He needs to be able
to protect himself

340
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:19,566
before we hunt down
his first vampire nest.

341
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,752
And here was I, thinking
you were the fun brother.

342
00:19:21,753 --> 00:19:23,737
Well, let's play
a little game, shall we?

343
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:25,706
Jeremy needs more victims,
and there's a whole town of people

344
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:29,843
down the road just waiting to be
turned into vampires for the slaughter.

345
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:31,879
You don't think that
occurred to me, Klaus?

346
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,914
The tragedy is, Damon,

347
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:36,767
it did occur to you,
yet you chose to ignore it.

348
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:39,770
And my guess is you did it
to impress Elena.

349
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:43,807
Somehow, to honor her, you'll
find a way to spare innocent lives

350
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,268
and walk Jeremy down
the moral high road.

351
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:51,482
That's why I've already made
the necessary corrections.

352
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:55,528
What did you do?

353
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,744
Don't tell me he ordered
another pizza.

354
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,329
No, I'm just an idiot.

355
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,714
I ran out of gas
and my phone's dead.

356
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,550
Think I could use yours?
Yeah, come on in.

357
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:11,502
I'll run upstairs
and grab my cell.

358
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:17,925
What the hell?

359
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,810
What are you doing here?

360
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:21,395
Car drama.

361
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:23,296
Your friend just went
to go get his phone.

362
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:24,681
Well, I'm about
to go take a shower,

363
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,892
but you're more than
welcome to wait inside.

364
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,909
Thanks.

365
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:43,149
Kol...

366
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,485
And Rebekah Mikaelson,
two members of

367
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:48,122
the original vampire family.
This is such a trip.

368
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,291
Where's the cure?

369
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,044
Compulsion won't work.

370
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,630
It's a little trick
I picked up in Tibet.

371
00:20:56,631 --> 00:21:01,001
Right. Well, we'll just have to
do this the old-fashioned way.

372
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:04,021
Beat him until he tells
you where to find it.

373
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:11,061
Still glued
to your seats?

374
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,189
Ooh, it's thick
with tension in here.

375
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:16,483
Let's spice things
up a bit.

376
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,869
Elena, truth or dare?

377
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,021
We're done playing your
stupid games, Rebekah.

378
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:23,123
Truth or dare,
Elena?

379
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:25,142
You're compelled.
Answer.

380
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:26,452
Dare.

381
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,580
I dare you
to tell Stefan

382
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,048
the truth
about Damon.

383
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:32,458
Seriously?

384
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:41,308
Being with Damon
makes me happy.

385
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:43,560
Clowns make you happy,
Elena.

386
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,178
Dig a little deeper.

387
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,981
When I'm with him...

388
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,437
It feels
unpredictable, like...

389
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,397
Like I'm free.

390
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,027
And how do you feel
when you're with Stefan?

391
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,795
Stop.

392
00:22:01,796 --> 00:22:03,780
She can't.
She's compelled.

393
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,618
Lately, I feel
like I'm a project,

394
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,705
like I'm a problem
that needs to be fixed.

395
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,442
I think I make him sad,

396
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:17,544
and I can't be with
someone like that

397
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,097
because...

398
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:24,093
When he looks at me, all
he sees is a broken toy.

399
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:32,977
Do you still love
Stefan?

400
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,146
Yes.

401
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:40,818
Are you still
in love with Stefan?

402
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,529
No.

403
00:22:49,794 --> 00:22:52,129
Did that hurt,

404
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,581
having someone you love drive
a dagger through your heart?

405
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,882
Go to hell.

406
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:59,253
Did... that... hurt?

407
00:23:04,142 --> 00:23:05,467
Yes.

408
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:12,808
Welcome to the last
900 years of my life.

409
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:21,491
Ah, good, you're here.
It was just getting depressing.

410
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:22,993
What the hell is going on?

411
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:25,362
Listen to the rules
carefully.

412
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,481
Stay in the building.
No vamp-running in the hallways.

413
00:23:28,482 --> 00:23:30,200
Vamp-running
from what?

414
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,173
- Turn.
- What?

415
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:38,091
You can't.
He'll lose control.

416
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:39,509
That's the whole point.

417
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,128
I've exhausted all
your knowledge.

418
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,380
Now I have the Professor
to help me find the cure,

419
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,998
you're just competition.

420
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:47,884
Whoever finds it first gets
to decide what to do with it:

421
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:51,722
Use it, share it,
destroy it, save it...

422
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,357
I want that to be me.

423
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:55,142
But if I turn,
I'll kill them.

424
00:23:56,694 --> 00:23:58,312
Yes, you will.

425
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,899
Turn.

426
00:24:21,883 --> 00:24:24,084
Did you find
your phone?

427
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,673
Get off!

428
00:24:29,674 --> 00:24:30,719
Get off!

429
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:58,779
Bonnie?

430
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,390
Rebekah told me that
you're a witch.

431
00:25:03,391 --> 00:25:05,587
Rebekah? What the hell
is going on?

432
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:08,211
Rebekah has Stefan, Elena,
and Caroline compelled.

433
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:10,592
She's getting them to actually
tell the truth for a change.

434
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:13,066
What?

435
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,651
Shane can't be compelled.

436
00:25:14,652 --> 00:25:17,771
She'll have him torture him
to find out what he knows.

437
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:20,207
What are you looking for?
I need salt.

438
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,576
I think I just
saw some.

439
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,784
What are you doing?

440
00:25:30,785 --> 00:25:32,402
If this pendant will
connect me to Shane,

441
00:25:32,403 --> 00:25:34,158
then I can do
a protection spell.

442
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:55,692
Where is the cure?!

443
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:00,030
Ohh!

444
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:01,727
Where is the cure?

445
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,880
You're human.
Why do you want it anyway?

446
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,114
That's the beauty
of this.

447
00:26:18,115 --> 00:26:19,549
You can have it.
I just want Silas.

448
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,135
No.

449
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:25,788
What do you know
about Silas?

450
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:27,757
He's the world's first
immortal being,

451
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:30,393
who just happens to be
imprisoned with the cure.

452
00:26:30,394 --> 00:26:32,466
And I want to free him.

453
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:33,800
No!

454
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:40,603
April?

455
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:44,240
What's happening?

456
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:54,417
Stop!

457
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:03,877
He's of no use dead.

458
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:05,161
Did you not hear
what he said?

459
00:27:05,162 --> 00:27:06,625
Silas will kill us
all, sister.

460
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:10,300
Silas does not exist.
He is a fairy tale

461
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:12,852
made up to scare children
into eating their vegetables.

462
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:14,883
Silas is very real.

463
00:27:16,857 --> 00:27:18,841
I know where he's buried,

464
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:21,061
and soon I'll have
the spell that wakes him.

465
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:22,896
Wait a second.
You're lying.

466
00:27:22,897 --> 00:27:24,731
You can't get to him
without his...

467
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:25,852
Tombstone?

468
00:27:26,284 --> 00:27:28,818
Dozens to die in
a blood sacrifice?

469
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:30,537
Believe me, I know.

470
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:32,288
I've done it.

471
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:35,525
Those massacres are
a pain to engineer.

472
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:38,962
You're the one who got
the council blown up.

473
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:41,748
It was
a noble sacrifice...

474
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:44,584
And temporary

475
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:47,053
because once
I raise Silas...

476
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:49,472
Silas will raise the dead.

477
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:53,176
He will bring back
every last soul...

478
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:55,895
Who died on his behalf.

479
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:57,313
No!

480
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:05,100
April, oh, my God!

481
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:24,624
Wait.
I can fight it.

482
00:28:42,693 --> 00:28:45,228
Aah! Get out of here!

483
00:28:45,229 --> 00:28:47,225
Go.

484
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:52,702
That door's
not gonna hold him.

485
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:51,987
You should be
thanking me.

486
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:53,873
You killed my only chance
at finding the cure.

487
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:56,408
Silas on the loose would
be hell on earth.

488
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:59,194
And frankly, sister...

489
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:01,747
I don't think you
could handle it.

490
00:30:01,748 --> 00:30:03,049
How did you
get that?

491
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,967
Way too easily.

492
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,455
Bonnie.

493
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,091
Help! Someone help!

494
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:49,011
Bonnie, what's going on?

495
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:50,012
She needs help.

496
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:51,514
What happened?

497
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:53,215
I did a protection spell,
but it accidentally linked

498
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:54,517
Shane to April.

499
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:55,935
And you
couldn't control it?

500
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:57,469
I didn't even know
I was doing it.

501
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,104
Usually I feel pain or I
bleed, but this time I just

502
00:30:59,105 --> 00:31:01,359
felt more power.

503
00:31:04,027 --> 00:31:05,427
It's ok. It's ok.

504
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:09,097
You're ok. You're ok.
You're ok. Ok.

505
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,266
Bonnie, get her out of
the school.

506
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:14,486
Just be careful.
Tyler is out there, and he turned.

507
00:31:14,487 --> 00:31:15,988
What about you?

508
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:17,918
No, we can't leave.
Rebekah's compelled us.

509
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,243
Just go.
We'll deal with her later.

510
00:31:28,635 --> 00:31:29,668
Stefan...

511
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:30,722
No.

512
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:33,308
Stefan, we have to
talk about this. Please.

513
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,257
Talk about what,
huh?

514
00:31:35,258 --> 00:31:38,344
How many more ways are there
for you to rip my heart out?

515
00:31:38,345 --> 00:31:39,397
I'm sorry.

516
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:41,630
Sorry that it happened,
or sorry that I found out?

517
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:44,033
I'm sorry
about all of it.

518
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:45,634
I'm really sorry, Stefan.

519
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:50,072
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I didn't want that.

520
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:56,623
Why are my least favorite
people always the most durable?

521
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:05,754
Tyler...

522
00:32:26,364 --> 00:32:29,449
I'm so sorry.

523
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,035
It wasn't your fault.

524
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:37,240
Yes, it was.

525
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:39,793
This whole thing.

526
00:32:39,794 --> 00:32:42,128
It's all my fault.

527
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:46,449
No, Tyler.

528
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,885
I should have
saved her.

529
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,180
Leave her out of this.

530
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:01,815
This is between
me and you.

531
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:04,768
You're still
protecting her?

532
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:07,984
Must I rip your bleeding
heart from your chest

533
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:11,324
and show you the scar tissue
that is Elena Gilbert?

534
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:15,467
There's
a solution

535
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:17,269
to all your
problems, you know.

536
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,872
I could compel him...

537
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:24,002
Erase every memory
he has of you.

538
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,754
Every day you've
spent together,

539
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:31,051
every kiss, every lie,
every ounce of pain.

540
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:36,038
I can take away every bit
of love he has for you,

541
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,990
give you both
a clean slate.

542
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:40,442
Just say the word,
and I'll make you

543
00:33:40,443 --> 00:33:44,046
and all that misery you've
caused him disappear.

544
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:45,046
Do it.

545
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:50,219
Excuse me?

546
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,405
Erase it all.
Every memory.

547
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:53,806
Stefan, no.

548
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:56,091
I said do it.

549
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:08,971
No. That would be
far too easy.

550
00:34:08,972 --> 00:34:11,807
I refuse to make
you forget her

551
00:34:11,808 --> 00:34:14,693
the way Klaus made you
forget me.

552
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:19,949
But at least you know
how he really feels.

553
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:29,592
Consider your eternity of
pain my revenge, Stefan.

554
00:34:29,593 --> 00:34:31,010
I've used you for
all you're worth.

555
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:34,129
So now you're free to go.

556
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:52,731
Stefan, wait.

557
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:21,801
Turns out I miscalculated.

558
00:35:21,802 --> 00:35:24,002
Kol's gonna be a problem.

559
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:27,891
I almost killed someone,

560
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,059
and that's what
you miscalculated?

561
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,127
April could've
died today.

562
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:33,662
That's only because you didn't
know the extent of your abilities.

563
00:35:33,663 --> 00:35:35,131
My father just
became mayor.

564
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,788
I can't be out
doing black magic.

565
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:40,070
That's not what
expression is.

566
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,174
Then what is it?

567
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,475
It's a way of doing magic

568
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,910
that isn't monitored by
nature or the spirits.

569
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,480
It isn't good nor bad.

570
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,248
But it also has
no limits,

571
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:54,317
so how you use it is
up to you.

572
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,704
That's what
I'm here for...

573
00:35:57,705 --> 00:36:00,540
To help you.

574
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:04,662
Bonnie, listen to me.
You are the key to everything.

575
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:10,100
I'm not going to let
anything bad happen to you.

576
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:29,686
Hope your day is going
better than mine.

577
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,372
Got to say,
I'm liking the odds.

578
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:34,692
Stefan knows about us.

579
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,461
Ooh.

580
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,906
How'd he take it?

581
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:42,158
How do you think?

582
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,635
I'm thinking,
for the first time all week,

583
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:49,723
I'm happy to be
at camp nowhere.

584
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:50,834
How's Jeremy?

585
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:54,177
That depends on
how much you trust me.

586
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,879
You know that I trust you.

587
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,251
Then I think he's gonna get
through this thing just fine.

588
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,603
Thanks for looking
out for him.

589
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:05,388
Yeah, well,
I told them if they were good,

590
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:10,160
I'd buy them both ice cream,
so I got to go.

591
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,855
Not yet.

592
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:16,282
Something happened today.

593
00:37:16,283 --> 00:37:21,371
I realized something
about you, about us.

594
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,790
And you can say
that it's the sire bond,

595
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,376
and you know what?
Maybe... maybe it is,

596
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:30,580
but I'm telling you
it's the most real thing

597
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,215
I love you, Damon.

598
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:49,365
I love you.

599
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:52,452
Look.

600
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:54,856
I'm going to get
this cure for you.

601
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:01,494
And I'm gonna have to
do things you don't like.

602
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:02,662
Damon...

603
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:04,824
But listen carefully.

604
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:11,387
Get in your car
right now.

605
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:13,124
Come to me.

606
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:17,060
I'll be there soon.

607
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:33,770
You let yourself in.

608
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,328
You called me.

609
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:38,648
Should I be checking
for hidden daggers?

610
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,010
Do you still want
to find the cure?

611
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,035
More than anything.

612
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:43,803
I want to ram it down
Niklaus' throat

613
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:47,590
and look into his eyes
as he realizes he's mortal again.

614
00:38:47,991 --> 00:38:50,260
But Shane's dead
and you are useless,

615
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,962
so I'm right back
where I started.

616
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,500
Shane's not dead.

617
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:58,184
But I watched
Kol impale him.

618
00:38:58,185 --> 00:39:00,687
Well, you probably shouldn't
have left him alone.

619
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:02,522
Bonnie did a little spell.

620
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:04,357
He's perfectly fine.

621
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,612
You didn't have
to tell me that.

622
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,315
Why am I really
here?

623
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,167
You were right.

624
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:15,785
I'm gonna be here
for an eternity,

625
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,037
and I will go insane
if I don't know

626
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:20,733
how Elena truly feels
about my brother.

627
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,212
If you really
want the cure,

628
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:27,630
you should know that
Shane has an agenda,

629
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,699
and it's a dark one.

630
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,585
He said he organized dozens
of people to die in sacrifice.

631
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:35,588
He admitted to the council
explosion where 12 people died,

632
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:37,206
and I'm guessing
it's not a coincidence

633
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:40,844
that 12 hybrids died at
the hand of my brother.

634
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,897
12...

635
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,815
Channeling the energy
from a mass death is used

636
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,985
in witchcraft to
perform dark spells.

637
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,487
It's called expression.

638
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:54,100
Shane admitted
all this to you?

639
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,859
Proudly.

640
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,460
Well, then I guess we'll have
to figure out how to manage him

641
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,605
while we find the cure
for ourselves.

642
00:40:01,455 --> 00:40:03,355
"We"?

643
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:05,194
There's no "we,"
Stefan.

644
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:08,911
Listen, I hate my brother,
and you hate yours.

645
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:11,497
But Damon's got Jeremy,
and Klaus has the sword,

646
00:40:11,498 --> 00:40:12,915
and Shane has Bonnie.

647
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:14,954
You and I are the only ones
left with nothing.

648
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,873
You said it yourself,
right?

649
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,387
Whoever finds
the cure first

650
00:40:18,388 --> 00:40:20,923
gets to decide
what to do with it.

651
00:40:20,924 --> 00:40:25,394
What do you say?
You want to be partners?

652
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:30,216
My father had no reason
to kill 11 people.

653
00:40:30,217 --> 00:40:32,768
He had no reason
to kill himself.

654
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:34,820
He loved me.

655
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:38,908
He loved Mystic Falls.

656
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:41,827
He was brainwashed into
sparking that fire.

657
00:40:41,828 --> 00:40:44,163
Professor Shane
organized his death

658
00:40:44,164 --> 00:40:46,069
and the 11 others
who died with him.

659
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:53,456
It's time this entire town
started telling the truth.

660
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:14,332
I was beginning to worry

661
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,140
you boys wouldn't find
the place.

662
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,753
What the hell...?

663
00:41:18,754 --> 00:41:20,789
Did you kill all
these people?

664
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,041
Not exactly.

665
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:26,234
They're
in transition.

666
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:28,778
Killing them is your job.

667
00:41:32,435 --> 00:41:33,718
You said you were
going to convince Klaus

668
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,326
to do this
another way.

669
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:40,608
I thought about it.

670
00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:45,169
And then I realized
his idea was better.
