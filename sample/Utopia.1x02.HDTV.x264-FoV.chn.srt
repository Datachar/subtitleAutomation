都是为了你好

135
00:12:56,685 --> 00:12:58,164
Ian and I are going up ahead to...
我和Ian要去...

136
00:12:58,165 --> 00:13:02,164
Great. Have fun.
好极了 祝玩好

137
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,644
Where are we going?
我们去哪?

138
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:13,604
I hack airline companies,
look for people going on holiday,
我侵入航空公司系统 找一些度假的人

139
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:17,604
stay at their houses.
They never know.
住他们的房子 他们绝不会知道

140
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:21,644
This is connected to
a trip wire in the drive.
这条绳子通到外面路上

141
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:24,364
Have everything by the back door,
always be ready to leave
把东西都放在后门

142
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:28,124
within 60 seconds.
随时准备在一分钟内闪人

143
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,684
What if you're in the bath?
如果在洗澡怎么办?

144
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,764
No baths, no showers.
不能洗澡 冲凉都不行

145
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:35,324
It's time to stop worrying
about looking pretty, Becky.
没时间打扮了 Becky

146
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:39,324
Are you trying to wind me up?
你是想气死我吗?

147
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:43,324
There'd be no value
to that that I can see.
气死你对我有什么好处

148
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:46,604
You got a thing for
tough women, is it?
你是不是和那个剽悍小妞有一腿?

149
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:48,604
Don't worry, Ian. I get it.
没问题 Ian 我懂的

150
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:52,524
Imagine her big,
strong arms around you.What?
- 想躺在她健壮的臂弯里吧     - 什么?

151
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:54,484
You let us walk into this.
是你把我们搞成这样的好吧

152
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:56,444
I mean, how much did you know?
你说你知道多少?

153
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:58,844
Because we had no idea.
Look at Wilson's face.


154
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:00,364
And that is not my fault!

155
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:02,124
Tell that to his dad.

156
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:06,124
Because she doesn't have him,
by the way.

157
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:11,484
Tell us the truth. All of it,
not bits, not pieces, all.

158
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,244
Or I leave.

159
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:17,404
Would you at least like
to sit down first, Becky?

160
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:21,404
No, Jessica. I fucking wouldn't.

161
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:28,484
The Network was created by two men.

162
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:32,444
A geneticist called Philip Carvel,
and someone called Mr Rabbit...

163
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:34,204
Mr Rabbit?

164
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:38,044
It's a codename, no-one knows
the real identity.

165
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,204
When the cold war began to wind down,

166
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:43,364
the various governments involved
decided to back away.

167
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:47,364
Only thing was, Mr Rabbit and
Carvel had no intention of stopping.

168
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:53,884
At some point, Carvel wanted out.

169
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:56,404
So they tortured him
to keep him working

170
00:14:56,405 --> 00:15:00,404
and held his daughter hostage.

171
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:04,484
Eventually, his mind snapped
and he went mad.

172
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:10,524
He was going be got rid of
but somehow he was smuggled out,

173
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:14,524
given a new name and hidden
in a psychiatric hospital.

174
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:18,604
The hospital was Shenley.

175
00:15:18,605 --> 00:15:21,044
And the new name was Mark Dane.

176
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,884
What, you...

177
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:26,884
you mean Carvel wrote Utopia?

178
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:30,884
A therapist got him drawing.

179
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:33,804
What he drew was...

180
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,004
incredible.

181
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:38,244
So all the things
in Utopia are real?

182
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:42,244
What, like BSE, they created that?

183
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,724
It's hard to say
what's real and what's not.

184
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:48,724
But, yeah. BSE was theirs.

185
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:52,764
How do you know all this?

186
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:56,604
I'm Philip Carvel's daughter.

187
00:15:56,605 --> 00:16:00,604
I was smuggled out
with him when I was four.

188
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:05,084
I've been on the run ever since.

189
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:42,284
Did you pricks give me heroin?

190
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:46,284
We had to, for the pain. Oh.

191
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:50,044
Hope it wasn't Afghan.

192
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:53,124
Taliban have been altering it
for years to make us infertile.

193
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:57,124
Everyone knows that.

194
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,324
We need to find Utopia.

195
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:21,324
We start with where it came from.

196
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:23,524
What? What about the others?

197
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:27,524
It's fine. I left a note.

198
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:30,284
"Back soon, don't have a bath."

199
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:32,164
Look, Wilson needs someone to...

200
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,524
That is not the reason!

201
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:37,244
Don't you see what she's doing?
She's trying to divide us!

202
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:39,564
- Becky, that makes no sense.
- Then why take you and not me?

203
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:41,484
Because you're not strong enough.

204
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:44,284
I can't risk taking you.

205
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:47,484
I know stuff.
I know more than he does.

206
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:49,124
What about Corvadt?

207
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,204
They're involved,
they gave people disease.

208
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:55,204
What about Corvadt?
They're involved, so what?

209
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:59,284
They're a bit player.

210
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:03,444
You're not ready, Becky.

211
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:08,764
- Look, you just need time to...
- Right, go on then.

212
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:12,764
Fuck off!

213
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:35,524
What's that?

214
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:38,684
It's nothing.

215
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,284
It's work.

216
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:44,284
Don't worry.

217
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:47,444
'I very scared.'

218
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:50,244
I know, I mean...

219
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:54,244
They find out I pregnant,
they angry.

220
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:57,564
You just have to get me some time.

221
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:59,684
Michael, I think I watched.

222
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:01,884
Watched? By who?

223
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:04,644
Don't know. I scared.

224
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:07,444
They come now.
Michael, you help, yes?

225
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:11,444
You good man, yes...?

226
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:18,444
Michael Dugdale?

227
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:21,524
My name's William Kaye,
I'm a journalist,

228
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:25,324
I want to talk
about the flu vaccine.

229
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:30,044
- No, no, I'm sorry...
- Listen to me! Your life is in danger.

230
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:32,884
This isn't about a fucking story!

231
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:34,284
If I just wanted a story,

232
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:38,284
I'd report the fact that you've got
a Russian prostitute pregnant.

233
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:43,764
There's my card.

234
00:19:44,205 --> 00:19:47,684
Things are going to get mad.

235
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:51,684
You'll need me when they do.

236
00:19:56,085 --> 00:20:00,084
Bejan got Utopia
from the comic shop.

237
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:06,124
They got it from
a dealer in Scotland...

238
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:10,244
who is now dead.

239
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:13,004
And he got it from this guy,
Jack Tate.

240
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,564
And who's Jack Tate?

241
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:18,564
The man who published Utopia.

242
00:20:23,165 --> 00:20:24,604
Mrs Tate?

243
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:25,644
Yes.

244
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:27,284
We need to speak to your husband.

245
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:29,404
Right.

246
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:33,404
My... husband's dead.

247
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:36,524
Do you want to come in?

248
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:40,524
This was his study.

249
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,684
Can you tell us where he died?

250
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:50,684
The A22 under the Hailsham Bridge.

251
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:53,164
He walked out in front of a lorry.

252
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:56,004
I'm sorry. Do you miss him?

253
00:20:56,005 --> 00:21:00,004
Of course I miss him.

254
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:04,884
Actually, I have something
you might be interested in.

255
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:08,884
Yes, it's a... thing, I can't
describe it, papers and drawings.

256
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:13,804
That sounds like exactly
the sort of thing we're looking for.

257
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:24,724
We have to get out of here, now.

258
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:28,724
What? Why?

259
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:33,564
You might want these papers...

260
00:21:34,805 --> 00:21:36,884
What the fuck have you done?!

261
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:37,724
She's with them.

262
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:39,484
What? What are you talking about?

263
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:43,484
Police turn up asking to see your
dead husband and you don't ask why?

264
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:47,644
Ah, shit.

265
00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:50,004
Glock 22.

266
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:51,124
She's CIA.

267
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,844
It means she knows
next to fucking nothing.

268
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,884
That's how they work.

269
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:57,204
They have people high up

270
00:21:57,205 --> 00:22:01,204
who get their drones
to do their work for them.

271
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:24,844
You're going to answer my questions.

272
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:28,844
And if I think
you've told me even one lie...

273
00:22:28,925 --> 00:22:31,924
I'll put this wire
in the water...

274
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:33,764
plug this in,

275
00:22:33,765 --> 00:22:36,564
flip the switch.

276
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:40,564
Understand?

277
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:53,364
Why are you here?

278
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:56,124
We got a tip-off.

279
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,604
The man who lived here

280
00:22:58,605 --> 00:23:02,604
has been wanted on terrorism
charges for over 25 years.

281
00:23:03,685 --> 00:23:06,524
We were too late,
he'd killed already himself,

282
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:10,524
so... so we took his wife in.

283
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:14,284
Has the wife given
you any information?

284
00:23:14,285 --> 00:23:18,284
I don't know.

285
00:23:18,805 --> 00:23:20,724
What did she say when you got here?

286
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:24,724
On the day he died he was talking
crazy, he wasn't making sense,

287
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:27,644
he said he'd been
visited by a tramp...

288
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:31,164
"A tramp"?

289
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:35,164
"A tramp" or "THE tramp"?

290
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:38,564
I don't know, "the" maybe, or...?

291
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:39,844
Look, hang on...

292
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:43,364
I asked you a question.

293
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:46,084
Was it "a tramp",

294
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:48,044
or "the tramp"?

295
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:52,044
"The". It was "the",
definitely "the".

296
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,593
She said "the".

297
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:04,498
- A select committee?
- Yes.

298
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:08,567
With powers to look into all
aspects of the acquisition process.

299
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:12,847
This is not going away, Geoff.
They're announcing it tomorrow.

300
00:24:14,648 --> 00:24:18,447
Do nothing. Keep quiet.

301
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:21,847
The morning will bring something new.
It always does.

302
00:24:21,848 --> 00:24:24,247
Geoff, we can't do nothing!

303
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:27,620
Well, it's sort of an order,
actually.

304
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:30,860
Worry less.

305
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:33,820
Look, I know it's scary now.

306
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:37,820
But tomorrow you'll be a hero,
I promise.

307
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:32,900
You didn't call in.

308
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:36,620
We were worried.

309
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:38,980
You're not agency. Who are you?

310
00:25:38,981 --> 00:25:42,260
No.

311
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:46,260
I'm not agency.
I'm a specialist.

312
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:52,180
What did you tell them?

313
00:25:52,421 --> 00:25:54,260
What did I tell them?

314
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:58,260
They were going to fucking fry me,
what do you think I told them?
I told them everything I knew.

315
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:03,780
Was it her?

316
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:06,020
Yeah.

317
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:08,300
Yeah, it was her.

318
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:12,300
She was with
a young black male, 25, 28.

319
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:20,620
Was a young man there?

320
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:25,660
Messed-up face, missing an eye?

321
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:32,780
Er...

322
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:36,060
no.

323
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:40,060
No, just them.

324
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:55,700
Look, are you going to untie me?

325
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:07,020
Wow. That looks great.

326
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:11,020
It's like, um, pirate chic.

327
00:27:11,901 --> 00:27:13,220
How's your sight?

328
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:17,220
Er... I can see shapes and colours.

329
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:24,140
Thanks for looking after me, Becky.

330
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:32,020
Where's my dad?

331
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:36,460
She lied.

332
00:27:36,461 --> 00:27:39,260
She had to get us out, Wilson.

333
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:41,260
I mean, he's probably fine.

334
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:42,300
I need to find out.

335
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:43,900
We can't.

336
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:46,660
They'll be monitoring our families,
we'll put them in danger...

337
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:49,220
Look online, I'll show you how to
disguise the search.

338
00:27:49,221 --> 00:27:51,100
I swear they won't know it
came from here.

339
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:52,220
Wilson, we can't.

340
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:56,220
I need to know.

341
00:27:56,661 --> 00:28:00,620
Please.

342
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:02,780
His name's Milton.

343
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,860
Milton? Milton Wilson?

344
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:09,860
What is it
with your family and names?

345
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:12,700
Right, you're sure they can't trace
this?

346
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:15,180
Positive. He's a cricket nut,
he logs in every day.

347
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:17,460
You'll see whether or not
he's logged in.

348
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:18,660
Is he there?

349
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:22,660
Hang on, I'm not in yet.

350
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:33,540
Is he there?

351
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:40,300
Er... Yeah.

352
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:47,420
Yeah, yeah, he's there, he's fine.

353
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:56,820
Grant has the manuscript.

354
00:28:57,061 --> 00:29:01,060
I heard them talking about it,
they mentioned him.

355
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:05,940
I weren't going to fucking tell her.

356
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:28,660
Who are you, then?

357
00:29:30,461 --> 00:29:33,300
I'm Alice.

358
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:35,780
What are you doing?

359
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:37,300
You're not from this school.

360
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:38,780
Just fuck off before you get hurt!

361
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:41,260
I'm not scared of you!

362
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:44,980
What's that?

363
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,380
Comic.

364
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:50,380
Well? Are you going to show me or
are you going to be a twat all day?

365
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:59,860
Are you going to tell me your name,
then, twat?

366
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:01,540
Grant.

367
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,140
Pleased to meet you, Grant.

368
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:07,140
Alice.

369
00:30:09,021 --> 00:30:11,140
Shit!

370
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:12,820
Don't go.

371
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:16,820
Same time tomorrow, twat.

372
00:30:26,581 --> 00:30:28,500
Are you sure this'll work?

373
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:30,540
Fanaticomix?
Grant's addicted to it.

374
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:31,820
It's nerd heaven.

375
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:35,220
And you have to read the personals
or you miss the good stuff.

376
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:39,220
I don't, but other people do.

377
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:43,540
But what if they're monitoring it?

378
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,700
Say to meet at the Embassy.

379
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:48,300
Dane based the Embassy
on the Taunton building

380
00:30:48,301 --> 00:30:50,140
on the Kame Hill Estate.

381
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:54,140
Only a real twat would know that.

382
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,660
And me.

383
00:30:56,661 --> 00:30:59,340
Never deny your inner twat, Wilson.

384
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:01,500
It's part of your charm.

385
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:05,500
Oh.

386
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:23,260
20...

387
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:27,260
and then six plus something
equals 20...

388
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:44,460
Don't forget to brush.

389
00:31:44,461 --> 00:31:45,820
I won't.

390
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,460
Good night, Mummy.

391
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:48,980
Sleep tight, darling.

392
00:31:48,981 --> 00:31:52,980
Love you.

393
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:57,980

What are you doing?

400
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:18,140
Can I sleep on your floor?

401
00:32:18,141 --> 00:32:22,140
I won't do nothing, I promise.

402
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:32,380
Have you got that comic?

403
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:34,380
This is so beautiful.

404
00:32:34,381 --> 00:32:36,660
Yeah. And that's part two.

405
00:32:36,661 --> 00:32:40,660
No-one's ever seen that,
just you and me.

406
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:45,660
You're quite surprising, you know.

407
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:49,660
You strike me more as a
Spider-Man type.

408
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:53,380
Oh, we should sleep.

409
00:32:53,381 --> 00:32:55,247
If my mum sees a light,
she'll come in.

410
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:53,915
Twat.

411
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:57,915
Thanks for letting me read Utopia.

412
00:34:10,276 --> 00:34:13,555
Just to look after, like.

413
00:34:13,556 --> 00:34:16,675
Keep it under your bed.

414
00:34:16,676 --> 00:34:19,955
I-I-I'll come back...

415
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:23,955
for that.

416
00:34:34,276 --> 00:34:36,315
Did they come back last night?

417
00:34:36,316 --> 00:34:40,315
Nope. Wankers.

418
00:34:40,716 --> 00:34:44,035
What we going to do?

419
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:46,195
I know what I'm going to do.

420
00:34:46,196 --> 00:34:49,995
I'm going to have a fucking bath.

421
00:34:49,996 --> 00:34:52,015
'We're getting more information

422
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,539
'on our breaking news story -

423
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,979

424
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,419

425
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,059

'from the suspected
outbreak of Russian flu.'

428
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,259
Shit!

429
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,339
18 dead, 33 infected.
There's only 86 on the island.

430
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,819
Geoff's ordered a quarantine.
No-one gets in or out.

431
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,499
Right.

432
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,499
If it's a new strain, it's got
infection rates already of 58%.

433
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,859
Michael, thank god
you got the vaccine.

434
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,219
You're a fucking hero.

435
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,099
You tell them my name?
Did you tell them my fucking name?

436
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,739
No, no, I didn't say anything.

437
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,059
I think they're on to me.

438
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,139
I think I'm being followed.
I saw two men.

439
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:01,707
Jesus Christ!

440
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,587
Have you seen the news?

441
00:36:03,588 --> 00:36:06,627
It's happening. I told you.

442
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:09,507
What do I do?

443
00:36:09,508 --> 00:36:13,507
I mean, people are dying!

444
00:36:15,148 --> 00:36:17,667
We need a sample of the vaccine.

445
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:19,867
You can request one
direct from Corvadt.

446
00:36:19,868 --> 00:36:22,987
It's within your remit as advisor.
There's a man in Sheffield.

447
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:26,987
A scientist called Donaldson.
Get it to him.

448
00:36:27,148 --> 00:36:31,147
What about you?

449
00:36:32,268 --> 00:36:36,267
What about you?

450
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:14,747
Do exactly as I fucking say!

451
00:37:18,388 --> 00:37:22,267
The Tramp used to be a scientist
with the Network. He got out.

452
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:24,787
Now he monitors their activities.

453
00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:28,187
He has to keep under the radar
to stay alive.

454
00:37:28,188 --> 00:37:29,947
I reckon that's his office.

455
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:33,507
A public phone?

456
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:36,427
Here we go.

457
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:38,827
Him? But...

458
00:37:38,828 --> 00:37:41,027
He really is a tramp?

459
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:45,027
Yeah, he's called 'The Tramp', Ian.

460
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:56,227
Hello, Danny.

461
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:59,667
Oh, shit! Oh!

462
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:03,667
Fucking hell!

463
00:38:04,188 --> 00:38:07,907
You nearly broke my nose. You
nearly broke my fucking nose!

464
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:09,387
Jessica, how lovely.

465
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:13,187
How did you know Utopia
had a part two?

466
00:38:13,188 --> 00:38:15,867
He's on our side, isn't he?

467
00:38:15,868 --> 00:38:18,987
There's no sides.

468
00:38:18,988 --> 00:38:22,947
Just people who help you
and people who don't.

469
00:38:22,948 --> 00:38:26,027
Now, now, Jess, you know
a gentleman never reveals his...

470
00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:30,027
Don't make me ask you again, Danny.

471
00:38:31,468 --> 00:38:34,387
Jack told me years ago.

472
00:38:34,388 --> 00:38:38,307
I went to see him now
because I wanted part two.

473
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:40,187
I knew Jack from
the old days, you see.

474
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:41,827
Why?

475
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:43,547
What's in it?

476
00:38:43,548 --> 00:38:44,787
He never told me,

477
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:48,507
and when your father died
it didn't matter any more

478
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:52,507
but now they have something.

479
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:58,387
Your father was working on a project
called Janus before he died.

480
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:03,347
They've replicated his research.

481
00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:07,347
They have it.
They're going to test it.

482
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:11,787
And what does Janus do?

483
00:39:11,788 --> 00:39:14,467
I swear I don't know.

484
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:16,507
The last thing
your father was working on

485
00:39:16,508 --> 00:39:20,507
were viral delivery vectors
that attack the human genome.

486
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:25,947
And Tate? What did he say?

487
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,747
He said that this is the end.

488
00:39:28,748 --> 00:39:32,347
He said we are all finished.

489
00:39:32,348 --> 00:39:36,347
And he took his own life.

490
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:40,787
We need to work together, Jess,
you and I...

491
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:44,787
What I still don't get is
what you were going to do with it.

492
00:39:46,948 --> 00:39:50,947
I mean, what use would it be to a
decrepit old sack of filth like you?

493
00:39:54,548 --> 00:39:58,547
What do you think your last breath
will feel like, Danny?

494
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:08,027
There's a woman. MI5.

495
00:40:08,028 --> 00:40:09,487
They already have MI5.

496
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:13,514
Not this one. She's like us.
Works in secret, trusts no-one.

497
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:16,321
She can help.

498
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:20,321
Now, Jess, if you get me
the manuscript I can get it to her.

499
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:24,761
What's her name?

500
00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:29,241
Please don't make me
tell you that, Jessica.

501
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:39,881
Milner. Her name's Milner.

502
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:44,521
She's a good woman, Jessica.

503
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:48,401
Ian, we need a vehicle.
You've seen me enough times.

504
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:52,401
It's time for you to do it.

505
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:04,641
Why didn't he give it to you?

506
00:41:04,642 --> 00:41:08,641
Bit odd?

507
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:13,121
I'm on your side, Jessica,
you know that.

508
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:17,121
I'm one of the...

509
00:41:55,962 --> 00:41:58,121
If we found him, they would.

510
00:41:58,122 --> 00:42:01,401
He gave up Milner's name like that.
You saw what they did to Wilson.

511
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:03,321
So you just killed him?

512
00:42:03,322 --> 00:42:06,281
- I pulled up the ladder.
- What?

513
00:42:06,282 --> 00:42:09,721
You fucking killed him!
You took his life!

514
00:42:09,722 --> 00:42:13,721
You just kill people if they're
not convenient, is that it?

515
00:42:15,962 --> 00:42:19,961
Why are you being so odd?

516
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:36,361
What the fuck are you doing?

517
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:44,401
They... They just came in.

518
00:42:44,402 --> 00:42:46,441
So you tied them up?

519
00:42:46,442 --> 00:42:50,081
Children? You tied up children?

520
00:42:50,082 --> 00:42:52,681
We're making it
look like a burglary!

521
00:42:52,682 --> 00:42:55,641
You did the right thing.

522
00:42:55,642 --> 00:42:58,201
We meet here tomorrow, 10pm.

523
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:02,201
Keep Wilson out of sight.
Stay on country roads, avoid CCTV.

524
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:06,241
You did exactly the right thing.

525
00:43:10,442 --> 00:43:14,441
So, I-I-I want
a sample of the vaccine.

526
00:43:16,882 --> 00:43:20,881
I-I-I'm sure you understand,
with the events of last night.

527
00:43:21,002 --> 00:43:25,001
So, this is an R680 request...

528
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:29,041
Excellent, yes. You want a sample.

529
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:33,041
Yes, it's all filled. It's all
in order. The paperwork is...

530
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:37,441
What do you want it for?

531
00:43:40,322 --> 00:43:44,321
You are contractually obliged
to supply a sample within 48 hours.

532
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:47,601
Yes, of course. Something wrong?

533
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:51,081
No, no, nothing's wrong.
I just need... I want a sample.

534
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:52,401
I can do that.

535
00:43:52,402 --> 00:43:55,921
'Freelance journalist,
William Kaye has been murdered

536
00:43:55,922 --> 00:43:58,441
'in a car park in Wapping
in East London,

537
00:43:58,442 --> 00:44:02,401
'in what is being described by police
as a gangland-style execution.

538
00:44:02,402 --> 00:44:06,401
'Mr Kaye was shot three times
in the chest and once in the head.

539
00:44:06,402 --> 00:44:08,361
'Police have a suspect in custody,

540
00:44:08,362 --> 00:44:11,641
'a Russian National
named as Anya Lutchenko.'

541
00:44:11,642 --> 00:44:13,041
Anya?!

542
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:16,281
'Police have described her
as a sex worker. The detective...'

543
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:28,761
How's your wife, Dugdale?

544
00:44:28,762 --> 00:44:32,761
Still trying to conceive, are you?

545
00:44:33,162 --> 00:44:37,161
Still trying for a little baby?

546
00:44:39,362 --> 00:44:43,361
Forget the vaccine, Mr Dugdale.
You're not a spy.

547
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:49,481
Becky, they'll be in
the Taunton Building.

548
00:44:49,482 --> 00:44:52,561
It's a huge water tower

549
00:44:52,562 --> 00:44:53,921
and, Becky, be careful.

550
00:44:53,922 --> 00:44:57,921
Grant's a city trader.
He's bound to be a cock.

551
00:45:37,162 --> 00:45:40,681
Are you Becky?

552
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:44,681
Grant?

553
00:45:49,242 --> 00:45:53,241
I thought you were a city trader?

554
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,401
Fuck me.

555
00:46:01,402 --> 00:46:05,401
Don't worry. It's just Wilson.
He's been hurt.

556
00:46:05,442 --> 00:46:09,441
You better get in the back with him.

557
00:46:09,522 --> 00:46:11,881
Wilson Wilson?

558
00:46:11,882 --> 00:46:13,761
You look a mess, man.

559
00:46:13,762 --> 00:46:15,521
Bloody hell, you sound about ten.

560
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,201
Close. He's 11.

561
00:46:17,202 --> 00:46:19,601
What? Really?

562
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:23,121
You said you owned a Porsche and that
your girlfriend was a supermodel.

563
00:46:23,122 --> 00:46:24,961
Yeah, I've got ambitions.

564
00:46:26,762 --> 00:46:30,761
Stay here and be nice, both of you.

565
00:46:34,562 --> 00:46:38,561
She got a boyfriend?

566
00:46:39,122 --> 00:46:43,121
I'm just going to get some water
for us from the shop, OK?

567
00:46:54,362 --> 00:46:58,361
It's me. The manuscript exists.

568
00:46:59,122 --> 00:47:00,801
The boy.

569
00:47:00,802 --> 00:47:04,801
The boy knows where it is.

570
00:47:22,402 --> 00:47:26,401
Where is Jessica Hyde?
Jessica Hyde在哪？

571
