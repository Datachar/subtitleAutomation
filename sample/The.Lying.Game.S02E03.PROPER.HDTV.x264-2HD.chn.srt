00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,130
幾個月前  我發現自己有一個孿生姐姐
A few months ago, I discovered I had a twin sister.

7
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,570
她要我去扮演她的角色
And then she she asked me to take her place,

8
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,780
保守秘密  尋找生母
keep the secret, find our real mother

9
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,880
努力保住性命
and try to stay alive.

10
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,830
如果你是我
Put yourself in my shoes.

11
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,410
這場謊言游戲你還能堅持多久
How long could you keep up the lying game?

12
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,520
我只是把一根撬胎棒
All I had to do was get a tire iron

13
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,380
放到瑞巴克先生的球包里
and drop it into Mr. Rybak's bag.

14
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,050
他陷害自己涉嫌謀殺嗎
Frame himself for murder?

15
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,140
他為何要這么做
Why would he do that?

16
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,310
擺脫我們的調查
To throw us off.

17
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,470
我就知道老爸是無辜的
I knew dad was innocent.

18
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,440
但是你從來不相信我
And you never listened

19
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,250
因為他不是你親生父親
because he's not your real father.

20
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,940
怎樣我們才能回到正軌
What will it take to make this right?

21
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,360
如果你現在向我保證
And if you were to promise me right now

22
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,120
你已經把一切都告訴我了
that you have told me everything.

23
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,050
我發誓我把一切都告訴了你
I swear you know everything.

24
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,420
我希望你能和克里斯汀重歸于好
I want you to work things out with Kristin.

25
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,820
我也很愿意陪在你身邊
And I'd like to be there for you.

26
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,030
我跟喬丹上過床
I hooked up with Jordan.

27
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,890
現在發現  他成了我新的繼哥哥
Now, it turns out he's my new stepbrother.

28
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,570
你真該考慮單飛
You should really think about going solo.

29
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,850
你拉琴的樣子真好看
It looks really good on you.

30
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,020
塞爾一直在我身邊
Thayer has always been there for me.

31
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,450
你和莎頓是天生一對
You and Sutton are perfect for each other.

32
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,940
所以你完全不介意
So, it's cool if Ethan and I give in

33
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,120
-我和伊森臣服于那顯露無疑的化學反應  -對
- to the chemistry between us? - Yeah.

34
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,900
你怎么才來
What took you so long?

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,540
見鬼
Aw, crap.

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,040
早上好  瞌睡蟲
Morning, sleepyhead.

37
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,150
老天  我干了什么
God, what did I do?

38
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,150
我呀
Me.

39
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,480
實際上  干了好幾次
Several times, actually.

40
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,040
不記得了嗎
Don't you remember?

41
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,100
當時我醉了
I was really drunk.

42
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,820
神志不清
Ow, I wasn't thinking.

43
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,280
我們都知道  我們考慮滾床單
Um, we both know we've been thinking

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,670
已經有一段時間了
about doing that for a while now.

45
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,910
這只是時間問題
It was only a matter of time.

46
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,150
我不該來這里
I never should've come here.

47
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,280
你在做什么  我還以為今天我們會一起度過
What are you doing? I thought we'd spend the day together.

48
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,070
我要去學校
I've got school.

49
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,610
但是昨晚你很爽  不是嗎
Well, you had a good time last night though, didn't you?

50
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,500
這不是重點
That's not the point, okay?

51
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,600
這是個錯誤  莎頓
It was a mistake, Sutton.

52
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,320
能把襯衫還給我嗎
Can I have my shirt back?

53
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,400
是因為艾瑪對嗎
This is because of Emma, isn't it?

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,780
對于這件事我真的很抱歉
I'm-I'm just really sorry about the whole thing, okay?

55
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,100
昨晚你看起來可沒什么歉意
Well, you didn't seem to be too sorry last night.

56
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,590
我知道  你是對的
I-I know... y-you're right.

57
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,050
你是對的  這對你不公平
You're right and that just was not fair to you.

58
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,650
我意識到了那點
I realize that and, um...

59
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,860
我保證不會再發生這事了
I promise it won't happen again.

60
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,340
《謊言游戲》  第二季第三集

61
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,450
你不該那么早就離開派對
You really shouldn't have left the party so early.

62
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,040
還有客人需要你接待
You still had guests to entertain.

63
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,420
比如說蘿倫·梅塞嗎
Like Laurel Mercer?

64
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,030
她只是你接近她爸爸所用的墊腳石
She's just a way for you to get closer to her dad.

65
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,730
大概吧  但我是你的話就會演下去
Maybe, but I'd play along if I were you.

66
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,820
如果你以前的一些過錯為人所知
'Cause it be a real shame

67
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,540
那將是真正的恥辱
if some of your past mistakes were to come to light.

68
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,800
不是嗎
Wouldn't it?

69
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,910
這樣吧  我們可以晚點討論這事
You know what? We can talk about this later.

70
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,350
你上學快遲到了
'Cause you're late for school.

71
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,320
我討厭你對我說教
I hate it when you get parental on me.

72
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:40,850
莎頓
Sutton?

73
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,710
我得和你說多少遍啊
How many times do I have to tell you?

74
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,100
抱歉  但這是緊急情況
I'm sorry, but this is an emergency.

75
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,750
我和伊森上床了
I slept with Ethan.

76
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,000
這不是什么緊急情況
That's not an emergency.

77
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,080
除非你沒有采取避孕措施
Unless, of course, you didn't use protection?

78
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,640
不  我采取了
No, I did.

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,710
今天早上他嚇壞了
He... he freaked out this morning.

80
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,050
他說他希望這一切沒有發生
And told me that he wished it didn't happen.

81
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,560
我很抱歉  莎頓
I'm so sorry, Sutton.

82
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,190
男孩有時就是這么殘酷
Boys can be so cruel.

83
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,730
這是她的錯
This is her fault.

84
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,100
如果我可以擺脫艾瑪  伊森就會忘了她
If I could just get rid of Emma, Ethan will forget about her.

85
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,480
她是你妹妹
She's your sister.

86
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,990
總有一天我們又會成為一家人
Someday we're going to be a family again.

87
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,550
你需要學會如何與她相處
And you need to get along with her.

88
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,550
他仍對她抱有幻想
He's holding out hope for her.

89
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,790
就像你爸爸一樣
Just like your father.

90
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,220
仍對克里斯汀抱有幻想
Holding out hope for Kristin.

91
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,280
是我在吐槽  你總能扯到自己身上去
Amazing how you can make my problems all about you.

92
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,020
事實是  你可以從我這里吸取教訓
The truth is, you could learn by my example.

93
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,280
我和泰德昨晚有過一段甜蜜時光
Ted and I kind of had a moment last night.

94
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,280
你行啊
Yay for you.

95
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,620
你也不錯
Yay for you too.

96
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,590
只要你聽我指揮
If you follow my lead.

97
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,150
我不會輕言放棄  你也不應該
I don't give up so easily, and neither should you.

98
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,170
好的  謝謝你的便車  兄弟
All right, thanks for the ride, man.

99
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,280
不客氣
No problem.

100
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,190
你昨晚去哪了
Where the hell you been all night?

101
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,570
和平常一樣  瞎玩
Screwing up like usual.

102
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,520
知道吧
You know?

103
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,270
我不得不搭便車
I had to hitch a ride.

104
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,360
說的太對了  你就是搞砸了
You're damn right you screwed up.

105
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,710
你老師打電話來了
Your teacher called.

106
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,060
比蒂老師嗎
Mr. Beattie?

107
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,120
你抄襲了一篇論文
You plagiarize a paper?

108
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,730
聽上去你已經知道了答案
Sounds like you already know the answer to that.

109
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,060
他把論文輸入了識別軟件
Yeah, he ran it through some software.

110
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,550
發現論文是網上購買的
Found out it was bought online.

111
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,140
丹  我知道我不該這樣做
Dan, I know I shouldn't have done that, okay?

112
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,970
省省吧  伊森
Save it, Ethan.

113
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,640
我不會讓你再回到少管所
I can't let you go back to juvie.

114
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,780
我讓比蒂給了你第二次機會
So I got Beattie to give you a second chance.

115
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,250
你去參加考試  范圍是這學期所有內容
You're going to take an exam on all the coursework.

116
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,700
很簡單  考試通過  就能結課
It's real simple: you pass the test, you pass the course.

117
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,360
好的  謝謝  什么時候考試
Okay, thanks. When is the test?

118
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,670
明天早上
Tomorrow morning.

119
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,320
就明天早上
It's tomorrow morning?

120
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,870
我怎么才能通過明天早上的考試
How am I going to pass a test tomorrow morning?

121
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,220
我不知道  你最好想想辦法
I don't know, but you better figure it out

122
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,040
因為你的未來取決于此
because your whole life depends on it.

123
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,260
警察局

124
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,660
你的眼睛怎么了
What happened to your eye?

125
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,090
我只是在交朋友
I'm just making friends.

126
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,540
監獄里人人都喜歡地方檢察官
Everybody in jail loves the D.A.

127
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,730
我就直說吧
Let me get this straight.

128
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,570
丹  我們的丹
Dan, our Dan,

129
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,000
居然覺得我是在陷害自己
came up with this crazy theory that I'm trying to frame myself?

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,340
這比你的解釋更為可信
You know it makes more sense than your own theory.

131
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,320
畢竟  是一個男人
After all, it was a man

132
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,160
打電話給女招待來陷害你
who called the waitress to set you up.

133
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,220
可能是麗貝卡干的
Rebecca could've done that.

134
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,580
她可能雇了別人
She could've hired someone.

135
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,630
或者  你自己打了電話
Or... you made the call yourself.

136
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,830
這件案子里  你應該代表我的利益
I thought you were trying to represent me here.

137
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,700
目的是把我弄出監獄
The objective was to get me out of jail.

138
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,070
你站在哪邊
Whose side are you on?

139
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,160
你雇我時告訴我
When you hired me, you told me

140
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,310
如果你能向我證明你的清白
that if you could convince me of your innocence,

141
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,260
陪審團也會相信你
you could convince a jury too. Well...

142
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,050
現在我沒那么相信你了
I'm not as convinced as I used to be.

143
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,750
查看女招待的電話記錄
Pull the waitress's phone records.

144
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,360
就能證明那通電話不是我打的
That'll prove I didn't make the call.

145
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,310
丹已經在查了
Dan's already on it.

146
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,490
今天下午就能知道結果
Should have them this afternoon.

147
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,210
特蕾莎
You know, Theresa,

148
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,130
你真的要把眼睛放亮點
you really ought to keep your eye on the ball.

149
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,280
麗貝卡才是幕后黑手
Rebecca's pulling the strings on this one.

150
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,390
不是我
Not me.

151
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,840
我聽到了陌生的手機鈴聲
I heard the strange ringtone

152
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,920
然后發現車庫里藏著這個
and I found this hidden in the garage.

153
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,490
-手機嗎  -對
- A cell phone? - Yeah.

154
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,030
警方不是已經搜查過你家了嗎
I thought the police already searched your whole house.

155
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,040
他們居然沒找到手機  這很奇怪
Well, I know, it's weird that they didn't find it,

156
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
但這肯定是爸爸的  我得上交
but it's got to be my dad's, so I have to turn it in.

157
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,550
等等  我們得查看一下他給誰打了電話
No, hold on, we need to check it and see who he called.

158
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,640
我已經看了
I already did.

159
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,970
所有來電都是無法查看
All incoming calls were blocked.

160
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,390
他撥打電話后就會清空記錄
And if he made any calls out, he cleared the log.

161
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,850
你能不能侵入手機  看看他刪掉了什么
Can't you hack into it and see what he deleted?

162
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,560
那可能被認為是篡改物證
But that might be considered tampering with evidence.

163
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,350
塞爾  要想查明他這段日子有什么企圖
Thayer, this is going to be our only way

164
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,680
這是唯一的辦法
we're gonna know what he's been up to all this time.

165
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,560
拜托  試試吧
Please? Can you just try?

166
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,650
好
Okay.

167
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,000
謝謝
Thank you.

168
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,170
不客氣
You're welcome.

169
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,100
他們好可愛哦
Aren't they adorable?

170
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,930
真不敢相信他們終于在一起了
I can't believe they finally got together.

171
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,510
她要進來了
She's coming.

172
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,660
自然點
Uh, act natural.

173
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,030
一切都好嗎
Hey, how's everything?

174
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,030
挺好的
Everything is fine.

175
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,870
你們是在監視我嗎
Were you spying on me?

176
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,760
我們嗎
Us?

177
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,430
沒有
No.

178
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,360
只是進來梳頭發
Just came in here to brush my hair.

179
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,900
用我的梳子嗎
With my brush?

180
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,620
好吧  我們是在監視你
Okay, we were totally spying.

181
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,450
天啊  你和塞爾  太棒了
Oh, my God. You and Thayer-- this is awesome.

182
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,320
你還真是"堅定"啊  蘿倫
Way to hold firm, Laurel.

183
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,060
小麥  你應該去和他談談
Mads, you should've come out and talked to him.

184
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,930
特別是昨晚的事發生以后
Especially after what happened last night.

185
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,470
他的嘴剛才正忙著呢
Well, his lips seemed pretty busy just now.

186
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,910
我還是回頭找他吧
So, I figured I'd do it later.

187
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,100
我不是想讓你們把注意力轉移到我身上
Okay, listen, not to make this all about me,

188
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,780
但我得問你們幾個問題
but I need to ask you guys a question.

189
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,400
你們覺得我約喬丹怎么樣
What do you think about me asking Jordan out?

190
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,410
好吧
Okay...

191
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,680
這主意糟透了
Terrible idea.

192
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,650
不是啦
No...

193
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,660
你有多了解他
How well do you know him?

194
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,160
怎么  你覺得我配不上他嗎
What? You think he's out of my league?

195
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,410
當然不是啦
No, of course not.

196
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,330
我只是覺得
I just think that...

197
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,750
我覺得你們很般配
I think you guys'd be great together.

198
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,920
你應該努力爭取  沒理由不這樣做
You should totally go for it. No reason not to.

199
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,020
太惡心了
This is disgusting!

200
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,090
這什么鬼東西
What is this?

201
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,130
天啊
God!

202
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,800
怎么了  你還好嗎
What's going on? Are you okay?

203
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,610
水槽堵了
Well, the sink is clogged.

204
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,810
也許爸爸能搞定
Ew, well, maybe Dad could fix it.

205
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,980
不  我現在不想依靠他
No, I don't want to have to rely on him right now.

206
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,740
我能自己搞定
I can take care of this myself.

207
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,640
我還以為心理治療挺順利
But I thought therapy went well.

208
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,970
那不意味著我們會重歸于好
That doesn't mean we are getting back together.

209
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,880
你試過污物碾碎器嗎
Have you tried the disposal?

210
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,200
也許會有用
Maybe that'll clear it?

211
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,920
這主意真好
That is a very good idea.

212
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,740
瞧瞧  姑娘們
You see, girls?

213
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,810
我們能自己搞定
We can handle this ourselves.

214
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,350
天啊
Oh, my God.

215
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,270
我去打電話給水管工
Um, I'll call a plumber.

216
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,260
阿羅約高中

217
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,190
哥們
Dude.

218
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,410
你和莎頓·梅塞和好了
You and Sutton Mercer back together again, huh?

219
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,540
我送你去小木屋時好像看到了她
Look, I might've seen her when I dropped you at the cabin.

220
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,620
她跑得真快
I mean, that girl moves fast.

221
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,930
我們沒發生什么
Nothing happened, okay?

222
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,150
不  真的很快
No, like literally fast.

223
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,480
像閃電俠一樣
Like The Flash.

224
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,070
開始她還在派對上
You know, she was at the party one minute,

225
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,520
接著就去了小木屋
then the cabin the next.

226
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,110
她肯定是抄了近路
She must've taken a shortcut.

227
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,630
她快馬加鞭趕去那里和你秘密約會
So, she races down there for a secret rendezvous,

228
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,340
你們居然沒有上床
and you guys don't even hook up?

229
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,950
你不會以為我會信你吧
Come on, you don't really expect me to believe that, do you?

230
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,610
喬丹  管好自己的嘴
Jordan, you need to keep your mouth shut.

231
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,520
行嗎
All right?

232
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,250
你什么都沒看見
You didn't see anything.

233
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,320
知道了嗎
Got it?

234
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,110
知道了
Got it.

235
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,160
她沒在那里
She wasn't there.

236
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,660
她也肯定不在大廳里
And she's definitely not down the hall either.

237
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,010
姑娘們好
Ladies.

238
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,320
他肯定是在看你
He was totally checking you out.

239
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,430
惡心  他是我繼哥哥
Ew, he's my stepbrother.

240
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,490
盡管如此  你得告訴蘿倫
Regardless, you have to tell Laurel

241
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,930
你和他上床了
that you hooked up with him.

242
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,140
今早你聽到她的話了
You heard her this morning.

243
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,900
她在說要約他出來
She was talking about asking him out.

244
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,380
那只不過是毫無意義的一夜情
It was a meaningless one-time thing,

245
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,620
我們約好對此絕口不提
and we've agreed never to speak about it again.

246
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,890
就像沒發生過一樣
It's like it didn't even happen.

247
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,490
但確實發生了
But it did happen.

248
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,250
我生物課要遲到了
I'm late for Bio.

249
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,600
大掃除呢
Cleaning out?

250
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,600
事實上  是退學
Dropping out, actually.

251
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,540
比蒂查出
Beattie found out

252
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,830
我那份世界文明史的論文是剽竊來的
I plagiarized that World Civ paper.

253
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,200
現在我也成了歷史
So, now I'm history.

254
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,390
不過也跟你沒關系
Not that it's any your business.

255
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,700
你會回少管所嗎
Well, won't you go back to juvie?

256
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,250
也許那里才是我的歸宿
Well, maybe that's where I belong.

257
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,960
不  伊森  一定有辦法的
No, Ethan, there has to be something you can do.

258
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,590
我明天必須過一場考試
Yeah, there's a test I'd have to pass tomorrow

259
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,480
內容涵蓋整學期的課程
on all the course material,

260
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,780
但我過不了  因為我落下太多了
but I can't do that because I'm too far behind,

261
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,690
所以我一開始才會作弊
which is why I cheated in the first place.

262
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,250
等等
Wait.

263
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,900
干什么
What?

264
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,770
我教你
I'll tutor you.

265
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,180
你為什么還在乎
Why do you even care?

266
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,990
在我做了那些事之后
After everything I did.

267
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,810
你不是跟塞爾在一起了嗎
Aren't you with Thayer now?

268
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,520
拜托  這跟他沒關系
Oh, come on. This has nothing to do with him.

269
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,310
事關你的將來
This is about your future.

270
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,830
你不能就此放棄
You can't just give up.

271
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,430
讓我幫你吧
Please, just let me help you.

272
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,150
以后再說
Later.

273
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,670
抱歉
Excuse me.

274
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,560
我幫你吧
Let me help.

275
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,730
天哪  我真是笨手笨腳
Oh, my gosh, I'm such a klutz.

276
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,770
也許他們應該在書上貼警示標記
Maybe they should put warning labels on these things.

277
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,480
你真幽默
You're hilarious.

278
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,790
是這樣的
Um, hey, look,

279
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,360
我知道這么說有點倉促
I know this is really short notice, um,

280
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,490
比特·巴倫今晚在十九號飛機庫打碟
but DJ Beat Baron is spinning tonight at Hangar 19.

281
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,450
我準備去的
And I was thinking of going.

282
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,410
你要來嗎
Would you want to come?

283
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,270
我都不知道比特·巴倫來鎮上了
I didn't even know that Beat Baron was in town.

284
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,300
他的混音超贊的
His mixes are so sick.

285
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,950
那你會來
So, you in?

286
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,690
當然
Yeah, for sure.

287
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,620
七點去接你
Um, pick up around 7:00?

288
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,570
說定了
It's a date.

289
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,390
我是說  定下這個時間[date有約會之意]
I mean, a date in the calendar sense of the word.

290
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,230
好的
Right.

291
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,340
那到時見
All right, I'll see you then.

292
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,270
好的
Okay.

293
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,420
小麥  我記得你說要道歉
Mads, I thought you said you wanted to apologize.

294
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,930
我在道歉呢
I am apologizing.

295
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,200
為昨晚的事  但我還是堅信爸爸無罪
For last night, but not for thinking Dad's innocent.

296
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,160
我告訴過你  他說
I told you, he said...

297
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,500
我才不管他說過什么
I don't care what he said.

298
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,750
他玩弄你  正如他玩弄全世界
He's playing you just like he plays everyone.

299
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
孩子們
Guys?

300
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,190
沒事吧
Everything okay?

301
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,750
沒事
Yeah, fine.

302
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,740
不  有事
No, it's not fine.

303
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,830
麗貝卡  告訴他
Rebecca, tell him about the fingerprint

304
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,990
警方在高爾夫球袋上找到他人指紋
they found on the golf bag.

305
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,330
從而證明  爸爸是遭人陷害的
They can prove that Dad's been set up,

306
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,050
爸爸從一開始就是這么說的
just like he's been saying all along.

307
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,820
我不想讓你們充滿期待
Well, I didn't want to get anybody's hopes up,

308
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,160
不過事情的確出現了轉機
but things are looking a lot better now.

309
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,480
我不會現在就開香檳慶祝
Well, I wouldn't pop that champagne just yet.

310
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,040
失陪了  我還有事要做
Excuse me, guys. I have work to do.

311
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,130
等等  我們還沒說完呢
Wait. We weren't finished talking.

312
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,140
塞爾  留下吧
Thayer, stay.

313
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,110
不如我們今晚一起吃晚餐吧
Why don't we all go to dinner together?

314
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,840
我請客
My treat.

315
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,880
我和莎頓今晚要打網球
Sutton and I are playing tennis tonight.

316
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,840
她馬上要參加地區賽了  抱歉
She has Regionals coming up. Sorry.

317
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,230
回見
See you.

318
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:23,910
他就是不聽勸
He just won't listen.

319
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,960
他會明白的
Oh, he'll come around.

320
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,930
小麥  我真正擔心的是你
Mads, it's you that I'm actually worried about.

321
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,580
你爸爸身陷囹圄  你住在梅塞家
Between all of this, your dad being in jail,

322
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,790
他們倆夫妻還在鬧離婚  這么多事
living at the Mercers while they're going through divorce.

323
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,070
泰德和克里斯汀在做心理治療
Well, Ted and Kristin are actually in therapy now.

324
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,560
關系有所改善了
So, things seem better.

325
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,740
是嗎
Really?

326
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,700
是的
Yeah.

327
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,100
那太好了
That's so good to hear.

328
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,000
太好了  你來了
Oh, good, you made it.

329
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,770
我沒想到你會來這么
I didn't think you would get here so...

330
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,990
等一下
Wait a second.

331
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,920
我特別關照孩子們別給你打電話
I told the girls specifically not to call you.

332
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
是嗎  蘿倫說得好像
Really? 'Cause Laurel made it sound

333
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,570
你都在求我過來了
like you were practically begging me to come over.

334
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,290
下水道也是她們堵的吧
Did they clog the drain too?

335
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,350
是她們干的也不出奇  我們家的孩子嘛
Wouldn't put it past them-- our girls.

336
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,620
真是詭計多端
Pretty crafty.

337
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,940
這是什么
Aww, what is this?

338
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,390
羊排  魚  雞肉
Lamb chops, some kind of fish, chicken.

339
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,760
想做什么  香溜肉片嗎
What are you thinking, piccata?

340
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,980
帕爾馬干酪肉片
Parmigiana.

341
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,600
真想吃家里的飯啊
Kill for a home-cooked meal,

342
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,330
不過我可沒在暗示什么
not that I'm hinting at anything.

343
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,190
你不覺得這事為時尚早嗎
Don't you think it's a little early for that?

344
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:18,830
是的
Right.

345
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,590
說到這個  我今天跟桑迪醫生通過電話
Speaking of which, I spoke to Dr. Sandy's office.

346
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,870
她說她周一早上十點有空
She said she has a time for us Monday at 10:00?

347
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,090
我有約了
I actually have another appointment at that time.

348
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,250
我也不想
And I'm not...

349
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,600
我不太想取消
I'm not sure that I want to cancel it, so...

350
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,130
不要有壓力  沒事的
No pressure, that's fine.

351
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,120
告訴我一聲就行
Just let me know.

352
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,510
我得去借個疏通工具
I have to rent a rooter for this,

353
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,000
-能等我明天弄嗎  -當然
- so can you wait till tomorrow? - Sure.

354
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,230
打給杰西卡·惠特曼的電話
The call to Jessica Whitman

355
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,090
是從一次性手機撥出的
was made from a burner cell,

356
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,370
有可能手機現在已經銷毀了
so chances are it's been destroyed by now.

357
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,390
也就是說  誰都有可能打給她
In other words, anyone could've called her,

358
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,390
包括埃里克
including Alec.

359
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,550
所以我給他秘書打了電話
Which is why I called his secretary

360
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,330
問問他那天的行程
to check his schedule that day.

361
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,060
從你這副表情看來  我猜你有所發現
And from that look, I'm guessing you found something.

362
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,250
他提早走了
He took off early.

363
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,870
一整個下午都不在  也沒說去哪
Was gone all afternoon. Didn't say where.

364
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,920
有點意思
Huh, that's interesting.

365
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,220
是的
Yeah.

366
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,690
非常抱歉  網球練習
I'm so sorry. I have to

367
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,740
我去不了了  有點事
bail on you for tennis. Something came up.

368
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,210
不論何事  都要靠邊站
Well, whatever it is, it should wait

369
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,980
因為我查到我爸用那部手機打給誰了
because I found out who my dad called with that cell phone.

370
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,850
他打給了杰西卡·惠特曼
Apparently, he made one call to a Jessica Whitman.

371
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,380
號碼已經聯系不上了  
Number's been disconnected,

372
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,730
但我覺得我們可以共同努力
but I figured we could work together

373
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,940
把她找出來
and try and find her.

374
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,880
我今晚沒空
I can't tonight.

375
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,980
但是...
But...

376
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,180
但是沒我你也能搞定
But you can do it without me.

377
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,450
我晚點打給你  好嗎
I'll call you later, okay?

378
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,460
等等  他們現在和好了嗎
Wait, they're getting along now?

379
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,270
我還以為他們彼此仇視呢
I thought they hated each other.

380
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,630
那是"七年戰爭"時候
That was during the Seven Years' War.

381
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,630
1756~1763年  英法普奧俄等國在歐洲 北美 印度等地進行爭奪殖民地戰爭

382
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,820
一戰的時英法兩國結成同盟
During World War I, France and England were allies.

383
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,680
如果他們都搞不明白誰喜歡誰
Well, how am I supposed to keep this stuff straight

384
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,520
我怎么能把這些事記清楚呢
if even they can't decide who likes who?

385
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,500
這比高中生糾葛還復雜
This is worse than high school.

386
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,990
或許你專心點別玩球就能記住
Maybe if you just focus and put the ball down.

387
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,770
我很專心啊
I am focused.

388
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,880
真的
I really am.

389
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,350
但是我專心思考的是
But I am focusing on how this is going

390
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,420
這究竟是多么浪費生命的事啊
to be a huge waste of my time.

391
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,510
你說得對
You're right.

392
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,700
你不想學  我怎么教都沒用
I can't teach you if you don't want to learn.

393
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,850
祝你在少管所玩得愉快
So have fun in juvie.

394
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,110
好吧  等等  等一下嘛
All right, wait, wait. Hang on a second, okay?

395
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,970
我就是覺得我不值得
I just feel like I don't deserve this.

396
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,500
什么
What?

397
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,750
你的幫助
Your help.

398
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,840
好吧
Okay.

399
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,290
你犯了個錯  伊森
You made a mistake, Ethan.

400
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,400
而你現在有機會改正
And now you have a chance to make it right.

401
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,840
伊森  我相信你
Ethan, I believe in you.

402
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,130
艾瑪  有件事我得告訴你
Emma, I have to tell you something.

403
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,630
我...
I...

404
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,410
希望我沒打攪你們
Well, hope I'm not interrupting anything.

405
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,790
莎頓  你瘋了嗎
Sutton, are you crazy?

406
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,680
你能不能放輕松點
Oh, would you relax?

407
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,620
我查過丹現在還在上班
I checked to make sure Dan was still at work.

408
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,430
我過來看看
I was stopping by

409
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,660
伊森要不要和我共進晚餐
to see if Ethan wanted to join me for dinner,

410
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,400
但顯然  他已經有安排了
but, apparently, he has plans.

411
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,740
不是你想的那樣  好嗎
It's not what you think, all right?

412
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,330
我  我明天有個考試
I've-I've got a test tomorrow.

413
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,620
我們  我們在學習  她在輔導我
We're... we're studying. She's helping me.

414
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,130
真是貼心啊
Oh, well, that's really sweet.

415
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,520
我批準了
I approve.

416
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,970
認真的嗎
Seriously?

417
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,640
那當然  我們都不希望小情人
Yes, seriously, we don't want lover boy

418
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,580
最后又回到少管所  對吧
to end up back in juvie now, do we?

419
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,410
小情人
Lover boy?

420
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,830
拜托  就是打個比方而已
Oh, come on. It's a figure of speech.

421
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,680
我們真有好多內容要復習
We really have a lot of work to do right now.

422
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,470
好的  那我把這些留在這兒
Okay, well, then I will leave you these.

423
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,910
當做一會兒餓了的點心
Just for a little snack, for later.

424
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,530
你最喜歡的那家燒烤店買的
It's from that favorite barbeque place you like.

425
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,420
祝你明天好運
Good luck tomorrow.

426
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,450
他不用碰運氣
He doesn't need luck.

427
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,970
他有我呢
He has me.

428
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,910
你該看看她那嘴臉
You should have seen her.

429
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,300
裝得一副天真無辜的樣子
Playing all innocent.

430
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,290
如果我還待在那兒沒走
I'm telling you that if I would have stayed there,

431
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,390
因謀殺入獄的就不只埃里克一個了
Alec wouldn't be the only one in jail for murder.

432
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,460
我接下來要說的話
You're going to be a lot happier

433
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,790
會讓你開心許多的
after you hear what I have to say.

434
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,970
什么話能讓我好過點
What could you possibly say that would make me feel better?

435
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,660
我想要你...
I want you...

436
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,620
把原來的生活從艾瑪手中奪過來
to take your life back from Emma.

437
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,610
什么時候換回身份也在計劃之中了
Since when is switching back ever been part of the plan?

438
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,310
我也只能這么做
It's just there's only so much I can do

439
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,920
防止泰德和克里斯汀和好了
to keep Ted and Kristin apart.

440
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,940
你要我從內部瓦解他倆的感情
So, you want me to work from the inside to split them up?

441
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,580
換個角度想
Well, think about it this way:

442
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,330
艾瑪要被孤立在此
Emma will be here in isolation,

443
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,950
而你能重出江湖
while you're out and about,

444
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,080
也就是說  沒人和你爭伊森了
which means you'll have Ethan all to yourself.

445
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,570
要知道她可不樂意這么做
You know she's not going to do this willingly.

446
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,300
你得找個法子勸服她
Mmm, you're going to have to find a way to persuade her.

447
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,250
別讓我失望啊  小甜心
Don't let me down, pumpkin.

448
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,060
小麥
Mads.

449
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,210
我沒走錯吧
Am I at the right house?

450
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,050
我就是在這兒住一陣子
Yeah, I'm just staying here for a little bit.

451
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,110
進來吧
Come on in.

452
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,120
蘿倫很快就好了
Laurel, uh, should be ready in a minute.

453
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,860
抱歉  我不知道你在這兒
Sorry, I didn't realize you'd be here.

454
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,260
有點尷尬
Guess this is kind of awkward.

455
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,280
有什么可尷尬的
Why would it be awkward?

456
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,060
明白了
Gotcha.

457
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,610
好了  多謝你招待他
All set. Thanks for entertaining him.

458
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,180
沒問題  你們倆好好玩
Yeah, not a problem. You two have fun.

459
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,300
你想來嗎
Hey, do you want to come?

460
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,680
我不行
Uh, I can't.

461
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,960
我可不想打擾你們
I don't want to impose.

462
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,190
開什么玩笑  我們就是出去玩
Are you kidding? We're just hanging out.

463
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,120
但我以為...
But I thought...

464
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,420
你也來吧
No, you should come.

465
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,400
又不是約會什么的
It's not like it's a date or anything.

466
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,120
喬丹  你能讓我們講兩句嗎
Jordan, can you give us a sec?

467
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,980
這回你必須跟我們走
Okay, now you have to come with us.

468
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,860
不行  我沒心情
No, I'm so not in the mood.

469
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,450
是你讓我約他出來的
You were the one who told me to ask him out,

470
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,280
現在我徹底是當局者迷
and now I'm totally confused.

471
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,450
如果你一塊兒來  還能幫我
If you come along, you can help me figure out

472
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,580
看看他是不是真的喜歡我
whether or not he's really into me or not.

473
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,690
拜托了
Please?

474
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,770
好吧
Fine.

475
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,600
先說好...  
For the record...

476
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,540
她也去  我們出發吧
She's in. Let's roll.

477
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,800
一字都不許提
Not a word.

478
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,140
打電話給杰西卡·惠特曼那天
You left work early the day

479
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,400
你提早下班了
that call to Jessica Whitman was made.

480
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,880
唯一使我愧疚的就是
The only thing I'm guilty of is

481
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,040
為了打高爾夫提早下班
leaving work early to play some golf.

482
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,880
你發表長篇大論之前
And before you say anything,

483
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,130
先搞明白高爾夫球場是不能用手機的
you're not allowed to have cell phones on the golf course, okay?

484
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,120
下周你得把我弄出去
We should get out next week.

485
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,670
你覺得呢  有空嗎
What do you say? You free?

486
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,240
她有空  你沒空
She is. You aren't.

487
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,940
三思啊  丹尼
Oh, think again, Danny Boy.

488
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,760
我可是有證人支持的
I've got a witness that'll back me up.

489
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,540
你們倆
You two

490
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,610
剛給了我那張無罪釋放的王牌
just gave me a get-out-of-jail-free card.

491
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,980
你好啊  妹妹
Hey, sis.

492
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,120
你在外面玩到好晚啊
You were out late.

493
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,050
你嚇死我了  莎頓
Oh, you scared the crap out of me, Sutton.

494
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,380
你真的應該時不時地
Hey, you know, you should really get

495
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,900
把球拍的網緊一緊
these re-strung every now and then.

496
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,910
你這是想要干嘛
What do you think you're doing?

497
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,870
你是不能去打網球的
You can't go play tennis.

498
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,490
你應該避開大家的視線
You're supposed to be staying out of sight.

499
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,590
而你應該為地區賽賽多加練習
And you're supposed to be practicing for Regionals,

500
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,940
不過這也沒妨礙你
but that doesn't seem to stop you

501
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,380
去伊森那兒幫他補習
from going over to Ethan's and tutoring him.

502
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,360
我知道你對那件事有些生氣
I knew you were upset about that.

503
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,770
我沒有生氣
Oh, I'm not upset.

504
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,580
我很高興你能幫他
I'm thrilled that you're helping him.

505
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,960
我只是不想輸掉地區賽
I just don't want to lose Regionals either.

506
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,260
你知道的  這場比賽關系重大
You know, a lot is riding on it:

507
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,730
參加大學甲級賽   拿獎學金
a chance to play D-1 tennis,

508
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,360
可全靠它了
and scholarship.

509
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,520
你什么時候開始關心這些了
Since when has any of that mattered to you?

510
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,650
我在小屋有大把的時間可以思考這些
Since I had a lot of time to think up at that cabin.

511
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,820
而且現實是
And the fact of the matter is,

512
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,940
我們倆將來都要去上大學
you and I are both going to have to go to college someday.

513
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,510
不用擔心  我已經準備好了參加比賽
Well, don't worry. I'm ready for the tournament.

514
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,410
而且我也會贏到獎學金
And I'm gonna win the scholarship.

515
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,980
我知道  但是多練一下也無妨
Yeah, but a little bit of practice wouldn't hurt.

516
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,670
所以我就在想  我可以指點你一下
So, I was thinking, I can just give you some pointers.

517
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,500
就明天吧
We go out tomorrow.

518
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,800
就當是玩了
Just for fun.

519
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,630
會被人看見的  莎頓
Someone will see us, Sutton.

520
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,640
那我們就到小鎮外面
Then, we'll do it across town.

521
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,150
這樣就沒人能認出我們了
No one will recognize us.

522
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,720
多大點事
What is the big deal?

523
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
你為什么這么執著呢
Why is this so important to you?

524
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,090
天啊  我只是想跟我的妹妹
Geez, just thought I'd spend

525
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,480
享受一下美好時光
some quality time with my sister,

526
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,910
不過你要是沒興趣的話
but if you're not interested.

527
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,560
不是的
No.

528
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,510
實際上我愿意去
Actually, I would love to.

529
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,180
說定了  姐姐
You're on, sis.

530
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,130
很感謝你能來
Thanks for coming down.

531
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,380
實際上我也正準備跟你談談
Actually, I was already planning on talking to you.

532
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,720
談什么
About what?

533
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,330
你先說吧  你不說這事很重要嗎
Well, you first. You said it was important.

534
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,800
我們需要你做一份聲明
Well, we need you to make a statement.

535
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,270
我們又發現了一些新證據
Some new evidence has come to light.

536
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,110
有人給那家俱樂部的女服務生打了個電話
Someone called a waitress at the club

537
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,550
花錢讓她去把那根撬胎棒
and paid her to plant the tire iron

538
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,830
放到你爸的高爾夫球袋里
in your father's golf bag.

539
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,200
-等一下 有人打過電話  -是的
- Wait. Somebody called? - Yeah.

540
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,430
那個女服務生的名字叫什么
What was the waitress's name?

541
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,420
杰西卡·惠特曼
Jessica Whitman.

542
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,190
給她打電話的那個人陷害了你爸  塞爾
Whoever called her set your father up, Thayer.

543
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,590
我的天啊  丹  他不是被陷害的
Oh, my God. Dan, he wasn't set up.

544
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,700
他就是打電話的那個人
He's the one who called.

545
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,190
你好  小塞
Hello, T.

546
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,240
-這是什么意思  -沒關系的  塞爾
- What the hell?  - It's okay, Thayer.

547
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,300
我們只是需要問你幾個問題
We just need to ask you some questions.

548
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,460
我也正好有幾個問題
Well, I've got some questions of my own.

549
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,050
比如說
Like....

550
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,580
你怎么解釋這個東西呢
How do you explain this, for example?

551
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,270
老爸
Dad?

552
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,980
你怎么能說你之前沒見過這部手機呢
How can you say you've never see that phone before?

553
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,540
我是在家里發現的
I found it in our house.

554
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,370
如果這部手機一直在咱們家里
If it was there the whole time,

555
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,830
那么警察搜查的時候為什么沒有發現它呢
why didn't the police find it when the searched the house?

556
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,370
肯定是他們疏忽了
They must have missed it.

557
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,540
得了吧  聽我說  無論是誰放在那的
Come on. Look, whoever planted the phone there,

558
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,730
肯定是在警察搜查過之后放的
planted it there after the search.

559
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,170
他們給這部手機打電話
And then they called it

560
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,870
就是要讓你發現它
to be sure you'd find it.

561
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,940
又或者可能是你玩砸了
Or maybe you just screwed up.

562
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,050
你以為藏得很好  實則不然
And you didn't hide it as well as you think you did.

563
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,770
我不是傻子  兒子
I'm no fool, son.

564
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,550
但你是個殺人犯
But you're a murderer.

565
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,240
好了  別再說了
Okay, that's enough.

566
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,450
這對我們一點幫助都沒有
This isn't getting us anywhere.

567
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,730
檢測結果出來了
I got the lab results.

568
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,720
我們的技術人員證實了
Our techs confirmed that...

569
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,360
確實是有人用這部電話
it is indeed the cell phone used

570
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,250
打給了杰西卡·惠特曼
to call Jessica Whitman.

571
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,500
真不幸啊
Ouch.

572
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,080
結案了
Case closed.

573
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,350
他們還證實了
They also determined

574
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,980
打給杰西卡的那通電話
that the call to Jessica...

575
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,680
是從亞利桑那州的旗桿市打出的
was made from Flagstaff, Arizona.

576
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,030
打那通電話的時刻
Weren't we playing golf the exact time

577
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,640
不正是我們玩高爾夫的時候嗎
that phone call was made?

578
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,540
是個星期五  對吧
Yeah, it was a Friday, right?

579
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,400
我能記得是因為你贏了我一桿
I remember it 'cause you beat me by one.

580
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,850
你打了個小鳥球[比標準桿少一桿進洞]
You birdied 18.

581
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,950
我知道  我記得
I know. I remember.

582
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,020
那么我是如何做到既在斯科茨代爾市
So how could I be playing golf with you in Scottsdale,

583
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,120
跟你打跟你打高爾夫  又出現在
and also be in Flagstaff,

584
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,280
150英里之外的旗桿市的呢
150 miles away?

585
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,930
我怎么知道  或許你雇了某個人
I don't know. Maybe you hired someone.

586
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,220
又或許有兩個我
Or maybe there's two of me.

587
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,890
太意想不到了
Well, it backfired.

588
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,570
現在我們已經有了足夠的證據
'Cause we got enough to go to the judge

589
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,310
讓法官取消對你的一切指控
and get the charges against you dropped.

590
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,590
我的天啊  不不不  請不要
Oh, my God. No, no, no, please, please,

591
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,900
-你不能讓他出去  -小塞  接受吧
- You can't let him out. - T, face it...

592
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,250
你看錯了所有的事情
You were wrong about everything,

593
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,340
而我唯一做錯的是
and the only mistake I made

594
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,750
在當初沒人可憐你時
was taking your bastard ass in

595
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,160
撿回了你這個白眼狼
when nobodelse gave a crap about you.

596
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,880
住手  住手
Hey, hey, hey! Okay, okay...

597
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,010
我們走  我們走
Let's go. Let's go.

598
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,070
我們走
Let's go.

599
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,650
該死的  他現在不能被放出來
Damn it. This can't be happening right now.

600
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,090
無論你愿不愿意  你爸都會被釋放
You dad's getting out whether you like it or not.

601
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,600
你得接受這個現實
You need to find a way to deal with that.

602
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,650
現在回家去  冷靜一下
Now go home and cool off.

603
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,770
您好  我是林賽·里奇韋律師辦公室的
Hi, this is Lindsey Ridgeway's office

604
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,770
我想提醒您別忘了周一上午10點的預約
reminding you of your appointment for Monday 10:00 A.M.

605
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,980
請回復我以便確認
Please call us back to confirm.

606
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,900
你還是要去見你的離婚事務律師嗎
You're still going to meet with your divorce attorney?

607
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,740
還不確定
I don't know.

608
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,420
可能吧
Maybe.

609
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,610
我們碰巧在那個時候有一次心里咨詢
It turns out we have a therapy session

610
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,890
在同一時間  所以我必須取消一個
the exact same time, so I do have to cancel one of them.

611
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,110
我能投票選哪個嗎
Do I get a vote on which one?

612
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,500
我已經知道你想選哪個了  謝謝你
Oh, I already know your vote, thank you very much,

613
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,380
別以為我不知道你們幾個女孩
and don't think I don't know what you girls were up to

614
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,400
在水管那事上搞什么鬼
with the whole plumbing thing. You are not

615
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,090
你們沒自己想得那么聰明
as clever as you think you are.

616
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,190
重點是  我們會不擇手段
The point is, we would do anything

617
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,740
維護家庭的完整
to keep this family intact.

618
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,450
取消和離婚律師的會面
And cancelling on the divorce attorney

619
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,750
一點不過火
is hardly going to extremes.

620
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,240
我喜歡這地方
I like this place.

621
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,630
你呢  小麥
What do you think, Mads?

622
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,620
我覺得好多人
I think there's too many people

623
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,440
太過努力地故作鎮定
trying too hard to be cool,

624
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,460
不過我倒不驚訝你喜歡這里
but I'm not surprised you like it.

625
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,490
什么情況
Excuse me?

626
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,320
她開玩笑呢
She's just kidding.

627
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,740
你開玩笑呢  是吧
You were just kidding, right?

628
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,280
是啊  你懂的  蘿倫
Yes, and you would know, Laurel,

629
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,460
因為你有極好的幽默感
because you have an amazing sense of humor,

630
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,890
有感染力的笑容
an infectious laugh,

631
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,340
超級棒的人品
great personality...

632
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,740
-得了吧  -有人會覺得她才貌兼備
- Stop. - Some might say that she is the total package.

633
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,400
別妄自菲薄
Well, don't sell yourself short.

634
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,090
謝謝你  繼兄
Ugh. Well, thank you, stepbrother.

635
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,100
我要去吧臺
I'm gonna go to the bar.

636
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,430
有人要喝酒嗎
Anyone want a drink?

637
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,480
當然  要我幫你嗎
Sure. You want any help?

638
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,890
不用  你陪蘿倫  我去買酒
No. You stay here with Laurel. I'll get the drinks.

639
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,070
至少讓我付錢吧
Well, at least let me buy.

640
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,580
我真的不要你的錢
I really don't want your money.

641
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,820
不好意思
Hey, I'm sorry.

642
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,260
我做錯什么了嗎
Did I do something wrong?

643
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,640
她又來了
Ha! There she goes again.

644
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,280
我喝水就行
Hey, I'll just take a water.

645
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,610
沒問題吧
If that's cool.

646
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,020
你喝什么  小麥
What're you gonna drink, Mads?

647
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,180
四海為家  還是激情海岸
A Cosmo? Sex on the beach?

648
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,380
我要回家
You know what? I'm gonna go home.

649
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,300
他歸你一個人了  你們倆
He's all yours. You two

650
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,770
玩得開心點
enjoy your evening.

651
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,220
我真覺得很抱歉
Um, I'm really sorry.

652
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,140
我不知道怎么了
I have no idea what just happened.

653
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,360
別管它了
Forget about it.

654
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,750
沒事的
It's fine.

655
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,750
我們跳舞吧
Let's dance.

656
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,540
好

No, I was just warming up.

660
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:34,060
我要出城跟莎頓比賽
I'm actually headed across town to have a match with Sutton.

661
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,830
-真的嗎  -嗯  她的主意
- Seriously? Mm-hmm. - It was her idea.

662
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,610
我肯定她另有所圖
I'm sure she has some sort of ulterior motive.

663
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,180
就你們倆嗎
You guys are gonna just be alone together?

664
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,040
是啊  就我們倆
Yes, we're gonna be alone together.

665
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,610
我迫不及待知道她在想什么
I can't wait to hear what she has on her mind.

666
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,050
你的考試怎么樣了
How did your test go?

667
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,430

-太棒了  -是啊  因為
- That's awesome. - Yeah, well,

670
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,490
我的補習老師很棒
I had a pretty good tutor.

671
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,850
你還想接著幫我嗎
You think you might want to keep helping me with that stuff?

672
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,460
我就能繼續自由自在了
So I can stay a freeman.

673
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,130
可以啊  好啊
Yeah, I can do that. Yeah.

674
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,190

All right. Thanks.

00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,990

真替你高興
I'm so happy for you.

677
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,520

What's going on here?

678
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,700
我正感謝她幫我呢
Um, I was just thanking her for helping me.

679
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,760
她給我補習
Uh, she tutored me.

680
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,270
給你補習
Tutoring you?

681
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,920
對  我以為你知道的
Yeah. I thought you knew.

682
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,520
真心不知道
Uh, no, actually.

683
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,660
等等  所以昨晚
Wait, hold on. So last night...

684
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,480
你必須去做的就是這個嗎
that's where you had to go?

685
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,680
考試就在今天
The test was today.

686
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,390
那我只能說  無所謂
You know what? It doesn't matter.

687
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,440
塞爾
Thayer...

688
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,700
埃里克今天放出來嗎
Alec's getting out?

689
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,500
法官正簽字呢
The judge is signing it up right now.

690
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,150
顯然他是被陷害的
He's obviously been framed.

691
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,970
當然了  誰陷害的
Of course. By whom?

692
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,280
懷疑是亞利桑那州旗桿市的一個女服務生
Well, the call to the waitress came from Flagstaff, Arizona.

693
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,410
有印象嗎
Does that mean anything to you?

694
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,150
旗桿市  沒有
Flagstaff, uh, no.

695
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,650
一點都沒有
Not at all.

696
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,400
不管怎樣  今晚之前他就能出來了
Anyway, he should be out by this evening.

697
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,160
你們好好慶祝吧
You two should celebrate.

698
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,550
會的  我還以為永遠都等不到今天了呢
Yes, I thought this day would never come.

699
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,890
謝謝你  特蕾莎
Thank you so much, Theresa.

700
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,120
泰德  我剛剛得知
Hey, Ted, I just got

701
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,010
-一個極好的消息  -是嗎  什么
- the most amazing news. - Really? What?

702
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,950
埃里克被放出來了
Alec's being released.

703
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,140
-真的嗎  -是啊
- Really? - Yeah.

704
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,050
那
Wow. That...

705
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,410
真出人意料
I didn't expect that.

706
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,660
我也沒想到
Neither was I.

707
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,600
說實在的
Actually.

708
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,630
為什么你這么沮喪
Well why are you so upset?

709
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,160
我很害怕  泰德
I'm scared, Ted.

710
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,260
每次我去監獄探望埃里克
It's just whenever I've gone to see

711
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,640
都會覺得
Alec in jail, I've gotten the feeling

712
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,730
他也許在將被捕的事怪罪于我
that he might blame me for his arrest.

713
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,710
怎么可能
Well, that's ridiculous.

714
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,330
你比任何人都支持他
You've been more supportive than anyone.

715
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,560
是倒是  不過
Yeah, well...

716
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,260
你知道他的
you know how he gets.

717
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,280
他的暴脾氣
His temper.

718
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,620
如果你那么害怕的話
Well, if you are that afraid,

719
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,000
干脆出城好了
why don't you leave town?

720
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,750
回洛杉磯吧
Go back to L.A.?

721
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,840
你不是說真的吧
You don't really mean that?

722
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,310
我還以為
I thought that...

723
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,520
你想多了
You thought wrong.

724
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,260
懂了
I see.

725
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,060
我不能
Well, I can't...

726
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,980
再逃跑一次
run away, not again.

727
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,510
我是說  我深愛的一切都在這
I mean, everything I love is here.

728
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,170
我的根
My roots are here.

729
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,620
我的家人都在這
My family is here.

730
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,490
你是說喬丹
You mean Jordan?

731
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,840
我還能說誰
Who else would I mean?

732
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,210
好吧  見諒
Well, I'm, I'm sorry.

733
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,540
我不該在你面前這么失態
I shouldn't have fallen apart on you like this.

734
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,620
謝謝你陪我
And I thank you for being there for me.

735
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,470
再見
see you.

736
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,960
我是塞爾  請留言
This is Thayer, you know what to do.

737
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,250
塞爾  還是我  艾瑪
Thayer, hi. It's Emma again.

738
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,830
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

739
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,860
給我回電話吧
Please call me back.

740
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,190
為愛傷神嗎
Trouble in paradise?

741
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,950
你確信這里沒人能認出我們
Are you sure nobody's gonna recognize us here?

742
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,900
拜托  知道的人都會被滅口的
Please, anyone worth knowing would be caught dead here.

743
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,130
好吧
All right.

744
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,850
你開球
You serve.

745
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,820
看來你是很久沒練習了
I'm sure you haven't played in a while.

746
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,860
艾瑪  你總是很體貼
Always so considerate, Emma.

747
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,690
想把事情變得有趣些嗎
Well, care to make things interesting?

748
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,430
你想干什么
Well, what did you have in mind?

749
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,890
贏的人當然是最佳運動員
Well, whoever wins is obviously the best player,

750
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,810
打地區賽的就應該是最佳運動員
so she should be the one that plays at Regionals.

751
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,240
原來是為這個
So that's what this is about.

752
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,570
你想換回來了
You want to switch back.

753
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,650
就幾天  為了地區賽
For a few days. Just for Regionals.

754
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,670
除非  你害怕了
Unless, of course, you're too scared, then...

755
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,460
但那沒必要
you don't have to.

756
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,210
我才沒有  你才該害怕
Oh, I'm not scared. You should be scared,

757
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,980
因為我會跟你死拼
'cause I will wipe these courts with you.

758
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,500
沖勁十足啊  艾瑪
Feisty, Emma.

759
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,090
好  我們說定了
Fine. We have a deal?

760
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,960
還沒  我也有條件
No, actually, I have some of my own terms.

761
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,210
輸的人  得待在小木屋里
Whoever loses...has to stay in the cabin.

762
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,930
這次是真格的
For real this time.

763
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,180
不許邁出一步  明白嗎
Can't step foot out of it. Understand?

764
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:02,620
說定了  祝你好運
Deal. Good luck.

765
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,770
祝我的好妹妹贏
May the best sister win.

766
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,820
我會的
Oh, I will.

767
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,690
你好
Oh, hey.

768
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,220
我想向你道歉
I wanted to apologize

769
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,580
為昨晚的事
for last night. I, um,

770
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,060
-我是不是把事情搞砸了  -才不是
- I guess I kind of screwed things up. Oh, no.

771
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,680
你的離開再好不過了
Leaving was the best thing you could've done.

772
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,480
一開始就不該叫你一起去的
I never should've asked you to come along.

773
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,000
你和喬丹一切都好
Oh, so things worked out with you and Jordan?

774
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,760
我們跳了一會舞  聊了好久
We danced for a while and talked for, like, hours

775
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,670
聊音樂啊  樂隊啊  還有生活
about music and bands and life.

776
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,850
他很可愛
He's so sweet and cute.

777
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,310
我想我們下周還會約會的
I think we're gonna go out again next week.

778
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,950
太好了  真為你們高興
Awesome. Well, I'm really happy for you.

779
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,200
我也是
Me, too.

780
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,020
你真好
You're the best.

781
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,920
塞爾  怎么了
Hey, Thayer. What's up?

782
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,760
什么
What?

783
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,750
第一輪我6比2勝出
That's me on the first set. 6-2.

784
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,740
你還真不賴
You're on fire.

785
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,430
如果你愿意我們可以不打了
Well, we can quit if you want.

786
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,400
不用  我就是有點不在狀態
No, no. I'm just a little off.

787
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,720
這禮拜都沒怎么睡好
Haven't really been getting much sleep this week.

788
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,110
因為你滿城跑
That's 'cause you're running around town

789
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,740
而你本該在小木屋老實待著休息
when you should be up at that cabin just relaxing.

790
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,270
很難有空休息
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard to relax

791
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,600
伊森會在半夜跑來
when Ethan just drops by in the middle of the night.

792
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,760
抱歉
Excuse me.

793
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,520
喬丹的派對后  他來過
after Jordan's party, he stopped by,

794
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,640
你說沒關系  我們就做愛了
and you said it was fine, so I slept with him.

795
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,800
你不會生氣吧
You're cool with that, right?

796
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,940
沒有  他
Yeah, whatever. He can...

797
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,670
他想怎樣就怎樣吧
He can do what he wants.

798
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,980
那就好  我還以為你會難過呢
Good, 'cause I totally thought you'd be, like, really upset.

799
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,010
我沒有
I'm not.

800
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,610
看得出來
Obviously.

801
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,480
該我開球了
My serve.

802
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,300
貌似那個  那個
The, um, the cam, um...

803
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,070
緊鏈器
Chain tensioner.

804
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,170
對  就是那個
Yeah, that's the one.

805
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:06,880
有噪音
make noises.

806
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,700
能幫忙看看嗎
Do you mind taking It's makinga look at it?

807
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,300
好的
All right.

808
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,350
莎頓不在這吧
Sutton's not here, is she?

809
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,100
她為什么要在這
Why would she be?

810
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,990
隨口問問
Just asking.

811
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,210
從來都不知道她會突然在哪冒出來
Never seem to know where she's gonna pop up next.

812
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,810
好像不是緊鏈器的問題
It didn't sound like your tensioner, but, um,

813
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,890
我們得檢查一下你的火花塞
we're probably gonna check your plugs out, all right?

814
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,760
你們之間到底有什么事
What's the deal with you guys anyways?

815
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,070
聽著  這很復雜
Look, it's, uh... it's complicated.

816
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,670
她過去是一個人  現在成了另一個人
Okay, she used to be one person and...now she's someone else.

817
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,910
而你卻不清楚自己更喜歡哪個
And you don't know which one you like more.

818
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,700
-就是那樣  -妞們都這樣
- Something like that, yeah. - Chicks.

819
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,370
即使你知道她們對你來說完全不可能
Even when you know they're completely wrong for you,

820
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,500
還是忍不住想她們
you still can't stop thinking about them.

821
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,110
聽起來你才是有問題的那個啊
Sounds to me like you're the one with the problem.

822
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,420
可不是嗎
Yeah, tell me about it.

823
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,560
不過  我確實在木屋里見過莎頓
But hey, I did see Sutton at the cabin.

824
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,440
她真的很喜歡你
She's into you, man.

825
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,190
全身心的愛你呢
Like, hardcore into you.

826
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,270
我要是你
If I were you,

827
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,030
才不會想那么多
I wouldn't overthink it.

828
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,020
我要是你
If I were you,

829
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,100
我也不會
I wouldn't either.

830
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,700
艾瑪
Emma!

831
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,620
小麥
Mads?

832
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,310
暫停一下
Time-out.

833
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,130
謝天謝地找到你了
Thank God I found you.

834
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,850
怎么了
What's the matter?

835
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,760
塞爾打電話來告別
Thayer just called to say good-bye.

836
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,360
他要回洛杉磯了
He's moving back to L.A.

837
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,570
我想他和我爸可能鬧得很兇
I guess things got pretty ugly between him and my dad.

838
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,050
我就知道他有事
Oh, I knew something was wrong with him.

839
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,820
糟糕  有好戲看了
Uh-oh. Drama.

840
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,470
我很想從中和解
I really wanted to make peace between them,

841
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,470
但他根本聽不進去
but he won't listen to me,

842
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,630
艾瑪  我覺得
and Emma, I think you might be

843
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,490
你是唯一一個能讓他留下的人
the only person who can keep him here.

844
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,410
你動作得快
And you've got to hurry

845
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,090
因為他已經在收拾行囊了
'cause he's packing right now.

846
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,460
分秒必爭
Tick-tock.

847
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,920
恭喜你  莎頓
Congratulations, Sutton.

848
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,870
你贏了  我認輸
You win. I forfeit.

849
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,020
塞爾
Thayer.

850
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,720
你不該來的  艾瑪
You shouldn't have come, Emma.

851
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,200
我不明白
I don't understand.

852
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,430
你和埃里克怎么了
What happened with Alec?

853
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,820
他贏了  一如往常
He won, like he always does.

854
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,900
他馬上就出獄  所以我沒法繼續留在這
He's getting out of jail, so I can't stay here anymore.

855
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,290
什么  他要出獄了
What, he's getting out?

856
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,560
怎么回事
How?

857
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,420
我找到的那部手機反而使他免罪
That phone I found exonerated him.

858
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,840
你能相信么
Can you believe that?

859
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,630
好吧
Okay...

860
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,010
那你也不必去另一座城市
Well, you don't have to leave.

861
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,880
我是說  你可以暫時住在別處
I mean, you could stay someplace else.

862
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,670
艾瑪  這里本就不是我的家
Emma, I don't really live here.

863
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,400
我回來只是為了幫助你們姐妹倆
I only came back to help you and Sutton,

864
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,070
但每一次我的努力  都會讓矛頭
but every single time I do, it always leads

865
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,390
指回我爸身上  而我根本無法打敗他
back to my father, and I can't, I can't beat him.

866
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:12,590
這讓我很難受
It's killing me.

867
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,150
抱歉
I'm sorry.

868
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,450
知道嗎  真相是
You know what, the truth is,

869
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,130
這里已經沒什么東西屬于我了
there is nothing left for me here anymore.

870
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,960
那我呢
What about me?

871
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,050
抱歉伊森的事沒給你事先報備  但
I'm-I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Ethan, but...

872
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,010
和那件事無關
It's not about that.

873
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,950
跟我走吧
I want you to come with me.

874
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,790
塞爾  我做不到
Uh... uh... Thayer, I can't do that.

875
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,480
梅塞一家是我唯一的家人
The Mercers are the only family I've ever known.

876
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,800
這時候我不能離開他們
I can't leave them right now.

877
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,010
那我也不能
Well, I can't...

878
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,300
我也不能留在這里
I can't stay either.

879
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,340
那就只能告別了
So then that's it?

880
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,140
也許這對大家都好
Maybe it's for the best.

881
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,880
但我
No, I... I...

882
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,760
照顧好自己
Take care of yourself.

883
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,150
你瞧  和新的一樣
See? Good as new.

884
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,380
那我就不在這里礙事了
Guess I'll just get out of your way.

885
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:51,710
泰德  關于周一那場心理治療
Ted, about that counseling session on Monday.

886
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,750
我決定參加
I'll be there.

887
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,260
那你原有的安排怎么辦
What about your other appointment?

888
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,000
取消了
I cancelled it.

889
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,360
那挺好
That's good to hear,

890
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,940
但我希望你帶著支票薄去  夫人
but I hope you brought your checkbook, ma'am,

891
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,740
因為管道修理賬單可是多得要命
'cause you've rung up quite a hefty plumbing bill.

892
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,960
帕爾馬干酪雞肉片
Chicken parmigiana?

893
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,400
是剩下的
Leftovers.

894
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,640
看來  這里的一切
Looks like everything is getting

895
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,730
正在回歸正軌
back to normal around here.

896
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,570
是的  你爸把下水管道修好了
Yes, your father fixed the drain.

897
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,420
我說的不是管道修理
I wasn't talking about the plumbing.

898
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,970
要我叫蘿倫嗎
Do you want me to get Laurel?

899
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,640
實話說  我真搞不懂你
You know, honestly, I can't figure you out.

900
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,380
前一分鐘  你熱辣無比
One minute, you're hot;

901
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,250
下一分鐘  你就冷若冰霜
the next minute, you're cold.

902
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,390
你到底清不清楚自己想要什么
Do you even know what you want?

903
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,860
那你呢  還跟蹤起我了
What about you? You're practically stalking me.

904
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,230
我根本不感興趣  好嗎
I am not interested, okay?

905
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,670
是嗎
Oh, is that right?

906
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,530
對
Yeah.

907
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,210
我愛夜晚自由的味道
Well, I love the smell of freedom in the evening.

908
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,360
按照你的要求
The press is at the other entrance,

909
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,280
媒體被安排到另一個入口了
just like you requested.

910
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,170
棒極了
Perfect.

911
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,980
這樣有充分時間準備隨后的嘩眾取寵
There'll be plenty of time for grandstanding later.

912
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,850
需要捎你回家嗎
Do you need a lift home?

913
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,720
不用
No.

914
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,330
我中途得去個地方
I've got a stop to make.

915
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,840
告訴我妻子  我這就過去
Tell my wife I'm coming for her.

916
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,870
你當時在旗桿市
You were in Flagstaff?

917
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,940
你該從高爾夫球場打那通電話
You were supposed to make that call from the golf course

918
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,490
這樣才不會招人疑問
so no one would question it.

919
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,890
不用  你什么都不用做
No, I don't want you to do anything.

920
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,760
埃里克隨時會回來
Alec will be here any minute.

921
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,730
我非常清楚怎么搞定他
I know exactly how to handle him.

922
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,050
寶貝  我回來了
Hey, baby, I'm home.

923
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,120
親愛的  我想死你了
Darling, I've missed you so much.

924
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,620
我明白
I'll bet.

925
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,220
莎頓  老天  你真是膽小
Sutton. God, you scare easily.

926
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,020
不然呢  殺人犯已經放出來了
Well, what do you expect? There's a murderer out there.

927
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,430
聽著  塞爾的事我很遺憾
Hey, so, I'm really sorry about the Thayer thing.

928
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,070
真不走運  但愿賭服輸
Tough break, but a deal's a deal.

929
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,410
記得  不許邁出小木屋一步
And if you remember, not one foot outside of the cabin.

930
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,950
我記得  這是你要求的
Your terms, I recall.

931
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,910
要是我不同意呢
And what if I refuse?

932
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,800
你不敢
You wouldn't dare.

933
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,180
試試看
Try me.

934
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,270
該死  擔心的事還是要發生
Shoot. I was afraid this would happen.

935
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,950
我也不會離開這里  所以
See, I'm not going to go either, so...

936
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,420
我們只能告訴家人這個天大的秘密
I think we're gonna just have to tell the family our big secret,

937
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,240
那可就難辦多了  因為我不知道
which is going to be really tough because Kristin,

938
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,620
克里斯汀會有什么反應
I don't really know how she's going to react.

939
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,200
她現在十分脆弱
She's very fragile right now.

940
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,130
你在嚇唬我
You're bluffing.

941
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,100
試試看
Try me.

942
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,960
好
Fine.

943
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,140
我走
I'm leaving,

944
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,440
但泰德和克里斯汀的關系有了很大改善
but Ted and Kristin are making really good progress,

945
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,490
你保證要推動他們
so just promise me that you'll keep pushing them

946
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,370
往正確的方向發展
in the right direction.

947
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:10,280
我保證  當然  他們可是我爸媽
Yes! Of course! They're my parents.

948
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,340
我怎么會不想讓他們合好
You think I don't want them together?

949
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,670
好吧  日后見
All right, I'll see you in a couple days.

950
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,790
小木屋里我留了幾條干凈的毛巾
I left some clean towels for you at the cabin.

951
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,750
也許你用得到
You may need them.

952
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,470
看見嗎
See,

953
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,860
我也可以很體貼  艾瑪
I can be considerate too, Emma.

954
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,630
地區賽好運
Good luck at Regionals.

955
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,010
我不用碰運氣
I don't need luck.
