00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:28,324
尼克从来没有被直接的戳过
Nick's never been
pogo'd directly.

137
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:30,709
你确实戳过他的比萨一次  那是  好吧  顺便一说
You did get his pizza one
time... which, by the way,

138
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:32,378
不是这个话题  你怎么从来都没有感觉到过?
is a whole nother debate--
how did you not feel that?

139
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:33,528
让我直说吧
Let me get this straight--

140
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:34,663
你们坐在一起谈论这个?
you guys sit around
and talk about this?

141
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:36,081
你的小弟弟还能换台
Your penis actually
changed the channel,

142
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,200
呃  看黑熊队比赛的那次
uh, when we were watching
the Bears game once.

143
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:39,201
你不觉得我  尼克和杰茜
You don't think
me, Nick and Jess

144
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,252
在你背后讨论你吗
talk about you behind your back?

145
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:41,337
因为我们就是在讨论你
Because we do.

146
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:42,704
比任何人的次数都多
You have more pogos than anyone.

147
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:44,840
你完全的误解了POGO这个词
You are completely
misusing the word pogo.

148
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:47,709
你是外号之王
You are the pogo king.

149
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:52,431
外号王
Pogo king.

150
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:54,500
外号王?
Pogo king?

151
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,635
现在我们来谈谈你们的创意比喻作业
So I wanted to talk about your
creative imagery assignments.

152
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,871
哇哦，童鞋们
Wow, guys.

153
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:01,807
我感觉我就像被一场巨大的闪闪发亮的
I really felt like I was buried

154
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,760
粉状的形容词雪崩
under a giant, gleaming, powdery

155
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:06,461
给埋了
avalanche of adjectives.

156
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:09,982
不是故意打断的，我听说
Don't mean to interrupt,
I just hear you're the best

157
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,017
你是最棒的成人教师？
- teacher of adults?
哦，不是
- Oh, no.

158
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:13,669
我想这里还能再加一个人不？
- I wonder if there's room for one more?
 不行
- No!

159
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:15,270
大家好，我是朱利叶斯.派伯伍德
How you guys doing?
I'm Julius Pepperwood.

160
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:17,373
现在不行，好吗？
- Not now, okay?
我干过条子，干过海军
- I'm an ex-cop, ex-Marine.

161
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:19,425
我来这是为了学怎么写短篇小说的
I'm here to learn how
to write short fiction.

162
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,043
好吧，朱利叶斯，那就
Oh, okay, Julius, just...

163
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:22,244
找个座位坐下，还有
take a seat and, um,

164
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,262
小点声
keep small.

165
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:24,579
我来自芝加哥
I'm from Chicago.

166
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:26,081
薄皮披萨？不滴，谢谢了
Thin-crust pizza?No, thank you.

167
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:27,549
哥是芝加哥来的
I'm from Chicago.

168
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,801
那么，为了下面一个有趣的后续活动
So, for a fun follow-up...

169
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:31,437
抱歉，我来晚了
- Sorry, I'm late.
没事，埃德加
- No, problem, Edgar.

170
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:33,138
我们要重温一下这些
We're just going over our

171
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,257
你们描述的形象
- descriptive imagery.
抱歉，老师
- I'm sorry, dear,

172
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:36,591
我听不见你声音
I can't hear you.
派伯伍德先生？
Mr. Pepperwood?

173
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:38,777
你要是不介意，我想离你近点
I'm gonna move closer,
if you don't mind.

174
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:39,928
不，你不用过来……呆在那
No, you don't have to go...
stay over there.

175
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:40,980
你好，伙计
How you doing, pal?

176
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:42,781
我是朱利叶斯.派伯伍德
- I'm Julius Pepperwood.
埃德加
- Edgar.

177
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:44,696
你干啥呢？
What are you doing?
你要是不介意，我想问问
If you don't mind me asking,

178
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:46,151
你为啥今天迟到了，埃德加？
why are you late
today, Edgar?

179
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:48,320
呃，堵车了，真要命（kill me英文直译是杀了我）
Uh, traffic, it
really killed me.

180
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:50,406
要你命？(杀了你？)
- It killed you?
派伯伍德先生
- Mr. Pepperwood.

181
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,457
你是说堵车捅了你一刀？
Would you say that
it stabbed you?

182
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:53,242
再说一遍？
Say that again?

183
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:54,397
把眼镜拿下来怎么样?
How about glasses on or off?

184
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:55,444
老师？要是我一直带着墨镜
Teach, if I keep them on,

185
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:57,429
看起来像个坏男孩不？
- am I a bad boy?
嘿！
- Hey.

186
00:05:57,464 --> 00:05:59,465
好吧，亲，我不戴了
All right, honey,
I'll take them off.

187
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:02,832
哇哦，摘了眼镜看那个蓝裙子又是另一种样子了
Whoa, that's a whole different
lens to see that blue dress.

188
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:05,671
不是
No.

189
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:06,955
好了，让我们重新集中精神
Okay, let's refocus.

190
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:09,425
我们谈谈关于
Um, let's talk
about the, um,

191
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,677
冲突的四种分类
four classifications
of conflict.

192
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:12,961
我们上周谈了
We talked about it
last week.

193
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:15,097
课本上有
It's in the workbook, um...

194
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:17,149
任何人想说一下吗？
Anybody want to help me?

195
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:18,150
四类冲突？
Four classifications
of conflict?

196
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:19,735
有人吗？
Anybody?
Anybody...

197
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:24,786
还没有人在办公时间签名
So, no one has signed up for
office hours and I just want

198
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,790
我就想让你们知道可以和我说任何事
you to know that you can talk
to me about anything.

199
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:29,060
再见（西班牙语都出来了）
<i>- Adios.</i>
任何事
- Anything at all.

201
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:35,183
没关系亲，你穿工作服也很帅气
Nothing, man, you look good in your Dockers.

202
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:37,818
什么?  没什么  我是朱利叶斯·派珀伍德
What? Nothing happened.I'm Julius Pepperwood.

203
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:38,936
你走把
Let it go.

204
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:42,323
唔
Whoops.

205
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:44,025
你为什么要这么做  -不是我  是风吹的
- Why did you do that?- The wind.

206
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:49,247
不  不  不  不  
No, no,no, no, no, no.

207
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:52,450
没什么事吧?
Is everything all right?

208
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:54,535
是的  没事  我们很好  兄弟
Yeah, everything's good.Oh, everything's fine, bro.

209
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:55,670
现在是什么情况
What's happening right now?

210
00:06:55,704 --> 00:06:57,872
对不起  埃德加  我真的
Sorry, Edgar,um, I really

211
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,924
很喜欢你写的故事
loved your story.

212
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,008
我想给你一些笔记  
Um, I wanted to give you

213
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:02,293
你什么时候有时间
some notes-- is there any time

214
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:03,767
都可以来...办公时间行嘛?

215
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,429
好啊  这样太好了
Yeah, that be really cool.

216
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:06,547
我太兴奋了
I'm really excited.

217
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:08,216
我随时都有空  所以...
Um, I'm available anytime, so...

218
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:09,767
我查下我的日程安排
- I'll check my calendar.- Yup.

219
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,219
这里没有信号
Can't get service around here.

220
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,500
星期三我要去鸟店
Wednesday I got to go to the bird store.

221
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:19,477
星期三下午怎么样?
Uh, what about Wednesday afternoon?

222
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:21,279
他是我叔叔
He's my uncle.

223
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:24,899
嘿  温斯顿  欢迎回家
Hey, Winston,I'm glad you're home.

224
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,534
我知道我的外号了
I know what my pogo is.

225
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:28,569
我跳舞像条海蛇
It's that I dance kind of like a sea snake.

227
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:35,326
的确像  但是跟外号差远了  施密特
Yeah, not even close, Schmidt.

228
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,545
你说什么...我知道  就是这个 
What are you talk...I know this it, man.

229
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:40,798
是我在你们洗澡的时候随便闯进来吗?
Is it that I barge into people's showers?

230
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:43,551
是我的毛毛虫眉毛  快看
It's my caterpillar eyebrows-- well, look.

232
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,837
没了
They're gone.

233
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:49,774
尼克  你做的太过分了  太过分了
Nick, you've gone way too far!Way too far.

234
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,275
如果你是来着埃德加的笔记的  你来晚了
Well, if you're here for Edgar's notebook, you're too late.

235
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:53,811
笔记在哪?
Where's the notebook?

236
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:54,996
尼克!
Nick!

237
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,198
我的准则一是什么?
What's my one rule?

238
00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:58,833
别偷你的毛线
It's to not steal your yarn.

239
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,601
不要偷我的毛线  兄弟
Don't steal my yarn, man.

240
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:01,953
这是我的准则一
It's my one thing.

241
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:03,821
但是你要看一下他的笔记里的东西
But look at what was inside of his notebook.

242
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:05,606
好吧  他不过是在课堂上涂鸦了而已  尼克
Okay, he was doodling in class, Nick.

243
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,224
滴血的凶器 ? 
Weapons, dripping with blood?

244
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,659
这根本就不是涂鸦
That is not a doodle.

245
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:09,977
你是谁  涂鸦警察?
What are you, the doodle police?

247
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:14,115
根本没有涂鸦警察  好吗           -真的吗?
- There's no doodle police, are there?- Really?

248
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,783
我不敢相信你还是不相信我
I can't believe you still don't believe me.

249
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,068
杰茜卡
Jessica...

250
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:19,069
作品D
Exhibit D.

251
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:21,739
他画的
He did this.

252
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:23,624
我要去埃德加家寻找更多的证据
I'm going to Edgar's house,I'm looking for more proof.

253
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,075
不行  尼克  你不能监视跟我有关的
No, Nick, you're not spying on the one student

254
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:26,460
任何一个学生
that I have a connection with.

255
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:27,832
我有地址    -不行
- I have the address right here.- No.

256
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,580
把地址给我...   -不给!
- Give me the...- No!

257
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:31,682
我已经记住地址了        -好吧  我也要跟你一起去
- I have the address memorized.- Fine, then I'm coming, too.

258
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:35,050
当你因为非法进入民宅被逮捕的时候去保释你
To bail you out of jail when you get arrested for trespassing.

259
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:38,213
好吧  你会亲眼看见我说的是对的    -好!
- Fine, then you'll see that I was right. - Fine!

260
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:40,975
你也会看到谁先到那里
And you'll also see who gets there first.

261
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:42,760
或者我们可以一起开车去
Maybe we should take one car.

262
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:44,528
为了环保
Just, like, for the environment.

263
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:45,730
是的  听起来不错  我们可以一起开车去
Yeah, that makes sense--we can drive together.

264
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:47,448
好!  -好!
- Fine!- Fine!

265
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,486
是我的痣  对吧
It's my mole, isn't it?

266
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:53,654
好吧  看着它消失吧
Well, consider it gone.

267
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:55,539
玩儿蛋去吧 烂外号
Game, set, pogo.

268
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:56,991
冷静点  伙计  不是因为你的痣
Chill out, man, it's not your mole.

269
00:08:57,042 --> 00:08:58,492
赶紧告诉我吧  这已经是最坏的了
Just tell me,this is the worst.

270
00:08:58,543 --> 00:08:59,610
这不是最坏的  施密特  最坏的是
This is not the worst, Schmidt-- the worst

271
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:01,111
你知道
is actually knowing.

272
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,446
你知道你的朋友们
Knowing that your friends

273
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:03,664
每晚都坐在一起
sit around every single night

274
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:05,282
讨论你的外号
talking about your pogo.

275
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,785
是什么外号?
What's a pogo?

276
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:09,253
他的眉毛没吓到你吗?
Those brows don't freak you out?

277
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:10,554
才不会  我看到过更恶心的
Nah, I've seen worse.

278
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,223
标签就是当你离开房间的时候
A pogo is what your friends talk about

279
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:13,341
你的朋友们背着你讨论你词语
when you leave the room.

280
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:14,975
噢  像你那藤壶般的脚趾甲?
Oh, like your barnacle toenails?

281
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:22,016
啊  (ˇˍˇ） 
Uh... sh...

282
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,234
你们说的是我的脚趾甲?
You guys talk about my toenails?

283
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:25,302
绝对没有...
Never...

284
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,239
谈论你的脚趾甲...施...施密特
talk about your toenails, Sch... Schmidt.

285
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:31,525
我知道我的脚趾甲是有些盘旋崎岖
I know my toenails are a little rugged.

286
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:32,743
散发着木头的清香
Woodsy.

287
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:34,478
我说  我觉得你有这样的脚趾甲
I mean, I have never wondered

288
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:36,580
爬棕榈树都无障碍啊
if you could shimmy up a palm tree.

289
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:39,083
但是这是因为我的脚上角质太多的原因啊  我说...
But it's because I have a keratin surplus, I mean...

290
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:41,285
他们没有那么糟吧  看这些小东西
They're not that bad,look at these things.

291
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:42,319
啊!施密特!   -太恶心了你!
- Aah! Schmidt!- Ew!

292
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:44,154
它看上去就像一把打开的瑞士军刀
It looks like an open Swiss Army knife.

293
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:46,257
大部分都很硬  但是其中有一些却是非常柔软的
Most of them are hard, but one of them is really, really soft.

294
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,659
我知道  我知道  你们说说我的标签是什么
I know, I know, I know-- we'll just talk about what my pogo is.

295
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:49,677
我的标签是啥?
What's my pogo?

296
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:51,662
是我说"锅"时的发音吗?
Is it the way I say "pan"?

297
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:54,098
呱  呱  呱
Pan, pan, pan.

298
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,050
听着  希希  这大部分都是我们公寓的事
Look, Cece, this is more of just a loft thing.

299
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:58,002
感谢你的幸运星你没有
Just thank your lucky stars that you don't have

300
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:59,053
钙化过度的脚趾甲!
calcified mongrel toes!

301
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:01,739


302
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:03,941
听上去就像堆死螃蟹
Things sound like a dang ol' crab.

303
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,811
就是这了
There it is.

304
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,512
假如有什么意外发生的话 我们需要对一个安全的暗号
If anything's gonna go down,we need a safe word.

305
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,232
不会有什么意外的 有意外也是我们搞砸的
Nothing's gonna go down unless we make it go down.

306
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:13,684
如果Pepperwood教会了我什么事的话  -没有Pepperwood这种东西
- If Pepperwood taught me anything - There's no Pepperwood.

307
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:17,021
没对好暗号之前绝对不能被抓到
Never get caught without a safe word.

308
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:18,622
我们的暗号是"杏"
We're gonna go with "apricot."

309
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,023
这也太普通了 我们需要
That's way too normal.We need to, like,

310
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,293
用一些古怪的词 像"巨龙拖鞋"这样的
go with something weird,like "dragon slippers."

311
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:24,628
神马?  -我平常说了太多的"杏"了
- What?- I use "apricot" too much in my normal life.

312
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:27,131
为神马你会说那么多的"杏"?
Why do you use "apricot" so much?

313
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:29,333
那你说我应该叫它们什么-"甜蜜香浓球"?
What am I supposed to call them-- "sweet tangy balls"?

314
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,253
杰茜卡 求你不要叫它们"甜蜜香浓球"
Don't call them "sweet tangy balls," Jessica.

315
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:34,037
好吧 但是这就是为什么我们不能用...
Well, that's why we can't use...

316
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:37,388
尼克 尼克
Nick... Nick...

317
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,093
尼克 噢!
Nick, oh!

318
00:10:40,144 --> 00:10:41,929
嘘 快来
Shh! Come on...

319
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,348
尼克 -请叫我朱利叶斯·派珀伍德
- Nick..-  Call me Julius Pepperwood, please.

320
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,183
你太荒谬了
You look ridiculous.

321
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:47,852
如果我们不被人发现
If we're hiding from people,

322
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:49,553
我叫你什么有什么不同?    -我望风
- why does it matter what I call you?- I got my eyes

323
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:51,555
你紧随我后     -不 不 不 这到底是啥意思?
- and you get my six.- No, no, what does this mean?

324
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,524
我十分肯定这个... -它的意思是"自行车靠右"
- I'm pretty sure this...- This means "right turn bicycle."

325
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:55,025
不对 我十分肯定它的意思是"停止行动"    -它的意思是"靠右行"
- No, I'm pretty sure this means "stop...- " It means "right turn."

326
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:57,027
尼克 说人话
Nick, seriously--use your words.

327
00:10:57,061 --> 00:11:00,364
别用这些该死的反恐特警队的暗号   -好的 我说人话
- Don't use freaking SWAT sign language.- Okay, these are my words.

328
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:01,449
噢!
Oh!

329
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,700
杏  杏  杏
Apricot, apricot,apricot.

330
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:05,235
闭嘴闭眼
Close your mouth,close your eyes.

331
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:11,509
埃德加跟他妈住在一起  当然了
Edgar lives with his mother.Of course he does.

332
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:13,344
那又怎样? 许多正常人都跟他们妈妈住在一起
So? A lot of normal people live with their mothers.

333
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:15,412
我的叔叔兰迪就跟他妈住在一起
Like my Uncle Randy.

334
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,548
那是因为他连独自去公园都不敢    -他早就不怕了
- He can't go near parks.- He was cleared.

335
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:19,467
你能不能...
You've got to...

336
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:20,718
杏!杏!
Apricot! Apricot!

337
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:24,085
快跑!
Get over here now!

338
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:33,931
噢卖糕的
- Oh, my God.- Oh, my God.

339
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:37,785
他在麻布袋里装了什么?
What's in that duffel bag?

340
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:41,271
在故事中他是个水管工人
He's the plumber from the story.

341
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:42,873
我之前怎么就没意识到?      -知道不听尼克言的结局了吧?
- How did I not see this before?- What was I saying?

342
00:11:42,908 --> 00:11:45,159
我的神 你说对了    -我知道  再说一遍
- Oh, my God, you were right.- Yes, say that again,

343
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,911
再说一遍 -你说对了你说对了 你是预言大帝
- say that again. You were right, you were right, you were right about everything.

344
00:11:46,945 --> 00:11:48,996
别忘了你说过的话!      -我的上帝
- Don't ever forget you're saying it!- Oh, my God,

345
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:50,548
不敢相信你说对了     -我是预言大帝!
- I can't believe you were right.- I was a right about everything!

346
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:52,883
那个袋子里究竟装了什么?
What the hell is in that duffel bag?

347
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:55,753
我咋知道  -不 尼克
- I don't know.- No, Nick.

348
00:11:55,787 --> 00:11:57,505
尼克 你要害死我们     -悄悄的就不会被发现了
- Nick, you're gonna get us killed.- Let's get down.

349
00:11:57,556 --> 00:12:00,007
尼克 尼克!
Nick... Nick...

350
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:02,343
嘘
Shh.

351
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:04,795
♪我是如此兴奋...(杰茜的手机铃声) 
♪ I'm so excited...

352
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,964
噢 我的...杰茜卡 关掉
Oh, my... Jessica, turn it off.

353
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:09,963
赶快关掉! 噢 上帝 那是埃德加  -我该怎么做?
- Turn it off! Oh, my God, it's Edgar.- What do I do?

354
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:10,901
关掉...给我
You turn it... Here.

355
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:13,470
赶快关掉 我不知道怎么弄    -给我 
- Turn it off. I don't know how to do this. - Okay.

357
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:16,807
我的上帝  赶快离开这儿
Oh, my God. Get the hell out of here.

358
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,782
杰茜 你在搞神马?
Jess, what are you doing?

359
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:27,084
你太笨了  这里有这么多出口
That is ridiculous. There was plenty of room.

360
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:28,035
但是这样看上去是个好主意
It seemed like a good idea.

361
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:29,454
为神马你非要钻进货车底下去?
Why would you go under a van?

362
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:31,005
赶紧走吧
Let's leave.

363
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:35,723
保持安静...-你们绝对不会相信刚刚发生的事情
Keep still...-You will not believe what just happened.

364
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:37,492
尼克说对了  -是的 我说对了
- Nick was right.- I was right.

365
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:38,743
我的神 你的眉毛怎么了?
Oh, my God, what happened to your eyebrows?

366
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:40,528
你看上去就像奥黛丽·赫本嘛
You look like Audrey Hepburn.

367
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:41,863
难道我们没有工业规模的切纸机?
Don't we own an industrial-size paper cutter?

368
00:12:41,897 --> 00:12:43,998
啊哈  -随便你们好了
- Ugh! - Oh, whatever.

369
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,700
这究竟是什么?     
- What the hell is that?
离吃饭的地方太近了！
- So close to the eating area!

370
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:47,869
温斯顿说你们都拿我的精致的脚趾甲开玩笑
Winston told me that you guys make fun of my gremlin toenails.

371
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:51,236
你们叫它们"叮叮当小脚丫""半人马战靴"神马神马的
That you call them "clickety- clacks" or "centaur boots."

372
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:52,874
你脑子出问题了吧 温斯顿?
What is wrong with you, Winston?

373
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:56,241
我脑子有毛病?  因为这就是我的标签
What <i>is</i> wrong with me? Besides my pogo.

374
00:12:57,345 --> 00:12:58,946
我说过了   我只是说出了我的想法
I told him.It just kind of popped out.

375
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:00,215
你知道这种感觉吧 温斯顿
You understand what that's like, right, Winston?

376
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:01,716
好吧 知道嘛 别表现的就像
Okay, you know what? Don't act like

377
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,301
我们不会背着你谈论你们一样
we don't talk about you two behind your backs.

378
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:05,887
因为我们确实会  你们都有标签 我的朋友们
Because we do. You both have pogos, my friends.

379
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:08,139
好吧 让我们先深呼吸一下再问我们自己
Okay, let's take a deep breath and ask ourselves

380
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,843
这场谈话是否真的值得结束我们的友谊
if this conversation is worth ruining our friendships over.

381
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:14,229
告诉我我的标签
Tell me my pogo.

382
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:15,980
我必须知道你们给我贴的标签
I need to know my pogo.

383
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:19,364
你们必须告诉我  我能接受  尽管说吧!
You guys need to tell me.I can take it. Lay it on me!

384
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:21,319
好吧  上升到了公寓事件了  是我的派的问题吗?
You know, it's kind of a loft thing.Is it my pies?

385
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,821
他们太酸了吗?
Are they too tart?

386
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:24,455
派不能成为标签 好吗
Pies can't be a pogo, okay?

387
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,457
我的考拉爪  这才是标签!
My koala claws,now that's a pogo!

388
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:27,959
至少你还可以吧你的标签藏在鞋子里
At least you can hide your pogo in a shoe.

389
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:31,496
他们给你的小弟弟制造鞋子-这就是他们所说的裤子!
They make shoes for your penis--they're called pants!

390
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:32,914
告诉我我的标签 -杰茜卡 不要
- Tell me my pogo.- Jessica, no.

391
00:13:32,948 --> 00:13:35,383
告诉我我的标签!  -你就是个万事通
- Tell me my pogo!- You're a know-it-all!

392
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:36,634
超级万事通   -还是最烂的
- Huge know-it-all.- The worst.

393
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:39,554
噢  我成了世界最烂超级万事通?
Oh, I'm the worst know-it-all in the world?

394
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:42,921
拜托 别说的这么夸张
Please. Hate hyperbolic speak. Please.

395
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:45,693
现在你们都知道了你们的标签  你们都知道了
Now you know your pogo,you truly know it all.

396
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,111
我又一次成了自作聪明的笨蛋
There I go being a smart-ass again.

397
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:48,913
这个可能就是我的标签
I mean, that, that could be my pogo.

398
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:50,532
还有一个没有呢
And then there was one.

399
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:52,617
噢  不  不  不  我很肯定你们有
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sure that you guys have stuff

400
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:54,419
背着我嘲笑我的事情
you laugh at me behind my back.

401
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:55,753
我们不会嘲笑你的标签 尼克
We don't laugh about your pogo, Nick.

402
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:57,905
是的 我们更加比较担心你
Yeah. We're worried about you.

403

你们担心我?
You're worried about me?

404
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:00,708
我们担心你你做不好
We're worried that you're not gonna make it.

405
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:03,044
做不好什么?     -正常人都能做好的事情
- Make it to what? - Just in general.

406
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:04,078
因为你不知道怎么照顾自己
'Cause you don't take care of yourself.

407
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,046
有时候我会把维生素碾碎了
Sometimes I'll crumple up vitamins

408
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,548
放在你的食物中
and I'll put them in your food.

409
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:09,100
我们轮流从你把裤子放到烘干机之前
We all take turns sneaking money into your pants pockets

410
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:11,436
拿出裤子口袋里面的钱
before we put them in the dryer.

411
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,555
是吗 ?  好吧  希望你们开心了
Yeah? Well,I hope you're happy.

412

所有人的标签都见光了
The pogos are out.

413
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,190
公寓活力被你们毁了
The loft dynamic is ruined.

414

我的娃娃音怎么样?
But what if I talk like a baby?

415

你还是很辣  我们都会这么说
You're still hot. That's all we're gonna talk about.

画着血淋淋的凶器

00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:36,590
好吧 你有没有...?
Okay, did you...?

534
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,393
太棒了
Great.

535
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:41,395
培根就是需要
It's just what bacon needs,

536
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:43,647
更多的脂肪么
more fat.

537
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:45,566
还有盐
And salt.

538
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,401
-这是什么？
-先别看 我还没写完呢
- What's this?
- Don't read that. I'm not finished...

539
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:50,768
《僵尸侦探——朱利叶斯.派伯伍德》？
"Julius Pepperwood:
Zombie Detective"?

540
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,656
他杀的所有人都已经死了
All his murder victims
are already dead,

541
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,759
所以他可能不需要侦探 我还没想好呢
so they obviously don't need
a detective. I'm working on it.

542
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:58,011
-“一个漆黑的炎热的夜晚”
-别念了
- "The night was inky hot."
- Don't do this.

543
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:01,298
“她大踏步的走进他的办公室，她心怀目的， 内心平静..
"She strode into his office with
a sense of purpose, place,

544
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,567
再来个词 问号”
another word here,
question mark."

545
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:04,968
我还在找另一个有“心”的词
I'm looking for another
"P" word there.

546
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,104
“她的僵尸腿，一个跟头能翻十万八千里”
"She had zombie legs
that went on for miles.

547
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:10,107
“那僵尸腿能让你的牙齿陷进去”
"They were the kind of legs
you could sink your teeth into.

548
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:13,991
“如果算上他的帽子的话，派伯伍德有两个朋友”
"Pepperwood had two friends--
one, if you count his hat.

549
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:16,894
“另外一个是他的“星期五”女孩，杰西卡 夜”
The other was his gal Friday,
Jessica Night."

550
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:20,5
不是你哦 杰茜
It's not you, Jess.

551
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:23,003
“她身材矮小，并不勇敢”
"She was small in stature,
but not in spunk.

552
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:25,789
“而且还很自以为是的觉得自己什么都懂”
And a super annoying
know-it-all."

553
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,341
晚上好
Good evening.

554
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:31,077
好啊
Hello.

555
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:32,546
哦 培根
Oh, bacon.

556
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,746
你从哪来啊？
Where the hell
did you come from?

557
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:35,682
我从我屋来啊
I came from my room.

558
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:38,135
不是吧 我怎么没听见你脚指甲敲地的声呢？
No, I didn't hear the pitter-
patter of your disgusting feet.

559
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:40,353
我剪了 泡脚确实有用
I cut my toenails.
Yeah, the soaking really worked.

560
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:41,471
看看吧 他们美不美
Look at that.
They're gorgeous now.

561
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:44,090
-我脚马上小一号了
-着火了
- Went down a full shoe size.
- Guys! Fire!

562
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:45,425
- Whoa, whoa!
- Oh, my God!

563
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,027
大家淡定 快找火警
Everybody relax!
Call a fireman!

564
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,612
-你打电话给火警啊
-我就是火警
- You call the fireman!
- I'm the fireman.

565
00:20:49,764 --> 00:20:52,098
你不能用水浇灭油起的火！
You can't put out a grease fire
with water!

566
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:53,482
你得让他隔绝空气
You have to smother it!

567
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:55,417
你咋不早说
Why didn't you say
that before?!

568
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:56,385
我不想自以为是
I don't want
to be a know-it-all!

569
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:58,254
-大傻子
-闭嘴
- You're so stupid!
- Shut up!

570
00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:00,056
-哇哦
-好样的
- Whoo! Oh!
- Nice!

571
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:01,157
太棒了
Yes!

572
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:03,126
牛逼啊 小伙子 
Amazing, my man! Whoa.
Whoa.

573
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:04,761
说实话 我没以为你能抱我
Honestly, I didn't know you were
gonna put your arm around me.

574
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:06,963
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

575
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:09,665
你在着火的时候还支了“小帐篷”
Oh, you put up your pup tent
in front of the fire.

576
00:21:09,732 --> 00:21:11,499
我不是故意的
It's involuntary.

577
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:14,900
这其实是肾上腺素
It is a combination
of adrenaline

578
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:16,772
和良好环境的结合产生的
and great circulation.

579
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,756
你以后拜托别没事就拥抱我了
And I'd appreciate it if you
don't just hug me randomly!

580
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:20,275
那很奇怪...
That's weird and...!

581
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:22,477

582
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:25,345
你们有没有注意过温斯顿跑步啊？
You ever notice...
when Winston runs,

583
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:27,882
-他有点边跑边放屁的样子
- that he kinda farts while
he's running?      - Yes!

584
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:29,016

585
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:30,350
-听起来像是破飞机似的
-新标志
- Sounds like a jalopy.
- New pogo.

586
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:32,586
我们有了个新的顶级标签啊
Oh, we got a great
new pogo!

587
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:34,614
边跑边放屁
He farts when he runs!

588
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:41,791
