1
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:04,852
Hey, uh, doesn't somebody have
a birthday

2
00:00:04,853 --> 00:00:06,988
coming up
in a couple of days?

3
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:08,422
That's right, I do.

4
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,057
And I hope you're
not planning on

5
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:11,859
making a big deal
out of it.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,461
Nope. I'm just
gonna stick with

7
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:15,329
the step-by-step instruction
manual you gave me.

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,098
Well...

9
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,199
Don't think of it
as a manual.

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,434
Just, you know,
little hints,

11
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:23,738
crumbs, to guide you
down the right path.

12
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,206
- Got it.
- You do 'em, you don't do 'em.

13
00:00:25,207 --> 00:00:27,408
Up to you.

14
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:29,110
I see.

15
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:31,646
So you're not expecting to be
"woken up at 8:00 a.m.

16
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:33,314
"with butterfly kisses,
warm croissants

17
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:35,216
and English breakfast tea"?

18
00:00:35,217 --> 00:00:38,319
If it happens, that
would be lovely.

19
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:41,122
And if it does,

20
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:42,790
a little bouquet
of fresh flowers

21
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,525
would make it
extra special.

22
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:46,360
Flowers.

23
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:47,995
- Your choice.
- Tulips.

24
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:49,430
Gerber daisies.

25
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,135
Color is totally
your call.

26
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:55,736
Gerber daisies.

27
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:57,071
In yellow.

28
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:01,676
- I choose yellow.
- Ah! (chuckles)

29
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:03,611
Shall I continue?

30
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:05,479
Yes, I'm dying to
hear what's next.

31
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,048
Well, after breakfast,

32
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,283
we're going to the museum
to see the dinosaurs.

33
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:11,719
Uh...

34
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,288
I-I didn't write
"dinosaurs."

35
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:16,490
Well, you wrote "museum"
and that's where they keep 'em.

36
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:19,794
Well, I'm fine
with whatever

37
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:21,095
as long as I'm strolling

38
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:23,064
hand in hand with
the man I love.

39
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:26,334
- Aw.
- At the Rembrandt exhibit.

40
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:27,368
(chuckles)

41
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:28,903
Art...

42
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:31,539
Mm-hmm.
Hand in hand.

43
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,274
Now, for lunch,
I'm thinking falafel.

44
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:34,608
How far off am I?

45
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,043
You know what?

46
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:37,478
I should've been
more specific.

47
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,981
I didn't know I was
up against falafel.

48
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:41,849
Hey, guys.

49
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,384
You remember Tom,

50
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:47,021
my friend-slash weed
dealer, don't you?

51
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:49,156
Hey, you remember Mike,

52
00:01:49,157 --> 00:01:51,692
my husband-slash
police officer

53
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:54,428
who arrests people
who deal drugs?

54
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:57,365
Not drugs, just weed.

55
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:00,267
Occasionally, 'shrooms,

56
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:02,436
but all organically grown
in his own greenhouse.

57
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:06,407
Hey, you don't have any
Gerber daisies, do you?

58
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:08,709
Tom's place is being tented
and bombed for termites,

59
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,178
so he's gonna crash here
for a couple of days.

60
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:12,546
You mean,
in the house?

61
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:14,048
Hey, listen, not to harsh
your mellow,

62
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,750
but if I had
a police dog here,

63
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:17,451
would he be barking
at your bag?

64
00:02:17,452 --> 00:02:18,686
Not unless he's
been trained

65
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:22,056
to sniff out pajamas
and ginkgo biloba.

66
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:23,758
All right, just checking.

67
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,459
I'm very respectful of your home

68
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,729
and your outdated
marijuana laws.

69
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,232
Great. We'll be like
the sheepdog and the coyote

70
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,367
when they say good morning
at the time clock.

71
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:35,336
(laughs)
Looney Tunes fan!

72
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:37,104
We'll get along
just fine.

73
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:45,546
They're not sleeping
together, are they?

74
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:48,149
No. She never brings
home a guy with a job.

75
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:53,988

78
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:16,227
Good morning.

79
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:18,529
Might've been, if I'd have
gotten any sleep last night.

80
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,664
Insomnia?

81
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:22,066
No, you and Mr. Zig-Zag
hitting bongos

82
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,101
and bongs all night long.

83
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:26,237
Oh, you could hear that?

84
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:29,841
Did I sound flat on "Iko Iko"?

85
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,109
Victoria, how long
is Tom gonna stay here?

86
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,111
This house is pretty
full as it is.

87
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,314
As long as he wants.
He's one of my best friends.

88
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:37,782
I've known him since
the ninth grade.

89
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:40,718
You've been buying weed from
that guy since ninth grade?

90
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,688
Tenth. The first year was free.

91
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:46,224
Well, your houseguest is
in the shower

92
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,859
bogarting all my hot water.

93
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,195
Tom likes to start his day with
a full-body loofah salt scrub.

94
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:53,431
Says it's like being reborn
every morning.

95
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:55,399
Well, he better be crowning,

96
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,401
otherwise, I'm heading up there
with forceps.

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,073
Namaste, ladies.

98
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,842
Sure.

99
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:10,047
I've been cleansed in fire,
now I must be baptized in ice.

100
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:15,786
What the hell does
that even mean?!

101
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,788
He used up all the hot water,

102
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:20,391
so now he's gonna roll around
naked in the snow.

103
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:22,326
Oh, great.

104
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,095
So we're gonna have a seven-foot
nude hippie

105
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,597
making snow angels
in the backyard.

106
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:28,399
He is not like
me and you.

107
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,901
He is an old soul.

108
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,669
Sees the world through
a third eye.

109
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,271
Yeah, I just hope our neighbors
don't get a good look

110
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:35,673
at his third eye.

111
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:36,941
That's gross.

112
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,943
I know it's gross!
I'm tired!

113
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:47,385
I'm telling you, man,

114
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,653
living alone
is the way to go.

115
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:50,655
I can't believe
I waited this long

116
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:52,189
to move out
of my grandma's house.

117
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,925
I can't believe she stacked
all your stuff

118
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,627
in the driveway and pushed it
into the street with her car.

119
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:58,829
She was helping me move.

120
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,498
My grandma can't carry
all those boxes

121
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:02,166
with that bad back of hers.

122
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,567
Bad back didn't keep her

123
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:06,170
from dancing in the street
as you drove away.

124
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:07,405
Point is, I'm on my own.

125
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:09,407
I can do whatever I want,
whenever I want.

126
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:11,108
You know what I did last night?

127
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:13,811
Is it something I'm gonna want
to hear while I'm eating?

128
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:15,046
I sat buck naked on my couch...

129
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,682
No, it is not.

130
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:19,283
...watching an X-rated
lesbian movie,

131
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:20,518
and nobody said "boo."

132
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,688
Allow me. Boo!

133
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:27,658
Hey, I sat on a pot holder.
I'm not an animal.

134
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:30,962
Well, I'm glad you're making
the most of your sweet freedom.

135
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,263
Well, you'll get a taste
of it tonight

136
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:33,698
when you come over to watch
that fight on pay-per-view.

137
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,333
Oh, I can't.

138
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,534
It's Molly's birthday tomorrow

139
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:39,337
and her wish list has become
a ransom note.

140
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,472
What are you talking about?

141
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:43,040
I already paid for the fight.

142
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,976
Plus I've been crockpotting
chili for two days!

143
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,544
Well, you can always
freeze that.

144
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,245
But I made enough for you...
where am I gonna get

145
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:49,547
that kind of freezer space?

146
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:53,818
Carl, what can I tell you?
It's my wife's birthday.

147
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,553
Do what you want to do.

148
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:57,254
It doesn't matter to me
because I like being alone.

149
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:58,889
In fact, I prefer it.

150
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,491
You know what
I'm gonna do right now?

151
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:02,226
I'm gonna go sit
in the squad car by myself

152
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:04,428
and enjoy
a little quality time.

153
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:09,000
What's the matter
with him?

154
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,534
He has never lived by himself,

155
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,636
and like the rest of us,
he has discovered that

156
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:16,140
a little bit of Carl
goes a very long way.

157
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:19,176
You're kidding.
I thought he was having a ball.

158
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:22,146
Well, last night he called me
four times just to talk.

159
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:25,649
And now I know he was naked
and sitting on a pot holder.

160
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:30,054
Thank God I didn't let him
Skype like he wanted to.

161
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,589
(groans)

162
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:36,127
VINCE:
<i>Oh...</i>

163
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,029
Oh-oh... Ooh!

164
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,364
Oh, oh, there it is.

165
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,633
That's Daddy's spot. Oh!

166
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:43,701
I thought you didn't like

167
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:45,269
getting a rubdown
from another man.

168
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,772
I usually don't, but this
doped-out longhair has got

169
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:50,274
the hands of an angel.

170
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,543
Shh. Find your center.

171
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:53,811
You already found it,

172
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:55,713
and I think
your thumb's in it. Oh!

173
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:57,114
Hey!

174
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:59,250
(shrieks)

175
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:02,319
That's not the welcome mat
I wanted to see!

176
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,288
ALL:
Namaste.

177
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:07,792
Tom's giving us all
shiatsu massages.

178
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:09,660
He's adjusting my chakras.

179
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,295
Did I say it right, Weird Jesus?

180
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:13,964
MOLLY:
Mom, kitchen!

181
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:15,366
All right!

182
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,268
Hey, don't wear out
those thumbs.

183
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,936
I got a couple of chakras

184
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:21,739
nobody's been able
to find yet.

185
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,140
Hey, I've tried.

186
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:25,676
Why do you think my neck's
all out of whack?

187
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:30,114
Okay, how are we gonna handle
getting this guy out of here?

188
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,382
What are you
talking about?

189
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:32,883
He makes dinner,
gives everybody massages.

190
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:34,652
Of the men living here,

191
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:35,753
he's not the one
I'd get rid of.

192
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,121
Mom, are you forgetting

193
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:40,191
that Shaggy in there also
happens to be a pot dealer?

194
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,559
I haven't forgotten.

195
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,427
But the man's
giving us all massages.

196
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:46,363
We should wait before we hit him
up for free weed.

197
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,266
VINCE:
There go my toxins.

198
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:51,001
I'm releasing!
I'm releasing!

199
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:53,537
I'm moving. I'm moving!

200
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,243
How you doing on toppings?

201
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,679
'Cause I could chop more onions
and grate some cheese.

202
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,614
I'm good on
fixings, Carl.

203
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:05,182
Well, anything you want,
just holler.

204
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,017
If I ain't got it,
I'll go get it.

205
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:09,086
I worry that all
this love is being wasted

206
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:11,122
on the wrong person.

207
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,524
Shh! The fight's starting.

208
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,392
Oh, this is gonna be
a great bout.

209
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:16,727
These guys are
perfectly matched.

210
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,596
I'm guessing this is gonna go
the distance.

211
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:19,864
(bell dings)

212
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,866

crowd cheering)

213
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,167
(body thuds)

214
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,403
I think the Mexican guy
just got knocked out.

215
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:28,539
Like hell he did.
I paid $40 for this fight.

216
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,907
He's gonna...
Get up!

217
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:32,376
Carl, it's over.

218
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:33,911
His mouthpiece
is in the third row

219
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:36,046
and his teeth
are still in it.

220
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,982
(bell dings three times,
turns off TV)

221
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:40,684
Well, that was fun.

222
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:42,753
What do you want
to do now?

223
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:46,891
Well, I DVR'd that
lesbian porno movie

224
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:50,094
and I only watched,
like, four minutes of it.

225
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,395
Let me get this straight.

226
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:52,530
You're asking me
to sit next to you on a couch

227
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:55,065
while we watch
an adult movie?

228
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,433
It's that or Yahtzee.

229
00:08:58,336 --> 00:08:59,737
Roll the film.

230
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,073

should quit her job

248
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,251
and share her talent

Hey, you got
to have faith.

255
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:04,335
- Just leap and the net will appear.
- Oh, yeah.

256
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:05,769
A net will appear, Tom,

257
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,305
and it's gonna be two guys
in white jackets

258
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:10,774
throwing it on you and then
tossing you in the back

259
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:12,810
of a panel van.

260
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:16,513
Hey, who wants
homemade gelato?

I do.

Molly, what don't you like Tom?

263
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,954
I just think
he's a bad influence.

264
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:26,123
And I don't want you to end up
living in some compound

265
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:28,359
washing his feet with your hair.

266
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:32,329
It would appear that someone
got a head start on the gelato.

267
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,132
Uh, it's cool.

268
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,634

that they're gonna be high

00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:43,574
Hi.

272
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:57,175
Do we have
any more gelato?

273
00:10:57,176 --> 00:10:59,244
Not for you we don't.

the police officer,

00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:04,216
is now stoned out of his gourd.

276
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:05,384
If you're worried they're
gonna check his urine,

277
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:06,919
Tom can get
you clean pee.

278
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,288
Absolutely
and the first jar is free.

279
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,123
I'm gonna hit him.
I'm gonna punch him

280
00:11:11,124 --> 00:11:12,691

No, Tom take care of this.

281
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:14,726
I'm on it. I'll
navigate his flight.

282
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:16,762
Hey, big buddy,
hows about you and I

283
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,397
go for a nice walk

288
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:27,873
Are you happy?
You turned my husband, the cop,

into a dope fiend.

290
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:31,209
Don't worry, Tom is
a total expert

291
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,612
at guiding people down
from a total freak-out.

292
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:34,980
He got away.

00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:37,416

I DVR'd the fight
so you can watch it

354
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:46,104
three or four times
while I make your malted.

355
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:48,173
Mmm, M&M'S.

356
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:49,641
Melt in your mouth,
not in your hands.

357
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:50,809
Just don't fill up on those
'cause I got

358
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,277
a tub of chili
with your name on it.

359
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:55,580
Mike!

360
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:58,049
That's right.

361
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:02,053
(sighs)

362
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:03,221
What are we
gonna do now?

363
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:04,723
We can't call
the police.

364
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:07,159
He's not picking
up his phone.

365
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,060
We could put flyers
up with his picture

366
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:11,763
on it that says he
answers to "Mike."

367
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:15,800
I know I said there was no bad
ideas, but that's a bad idea.

368
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,636
I'm sorry.

369
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:19,571
I'm just trying to help.

370
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:23,508
I think some of this
could be my fault.

371
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:25,977
Some of it?
How about all of it?

372
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:29,214
You're right.

373
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:31,216
I'm just a big,
stupid pothead

374
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:34,119
with less sense than a squirrel.

375
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,289
I... (sighs)

376
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,858
I didn't say you were stupid.

377
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:42,761
And I certainly didn't say
"squirrel stupid."

378
00:15:42,762 --> 00:15:46,097
I just... I wish you made
better choices.

379
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:49,201
Probably should've just stayed
at junior college.

380
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:52,003
But when a Backstreet Boy lures
you on the tour bus,

381
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:54,940
you don't worry
that it's finals week.

382
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:58,376
Well, maybe you do.

383
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,614
That's bong water
under the bridge.

384
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:04,583
You know, you could
still go back.

385
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:06,318
You mean go
back to school?

386
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,586
Why not?

387
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:10,522
You'd be a good student
if you applied yourself.

388
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:12,457
I'm sure you've saved up
a little bit of money.

389
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,893
$36,000.

390
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:16,962
What?

391
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:20,665
Well, I don't pay rent.

392
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,867
And I haven't had to
buy a meal or a drink

393
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:25,270
since my boobs came in.

394
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:28,306
(quietly):
Wow.

395
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,278
Can I borrow $8,000?

396
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:36,581
We should probably keep

397
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:39,451
looking for Mike.
Okay.

398
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:41,519
Mmm.

399
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:45,724
(groans)

400
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,494
All right, that's the
last of the chili.

401
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:51,029
But don't worry,
I'm whipping up some

402
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,764
of my famous silver
dollar pancakes.

403
00:16:52,765 --> 00:16:54,399
Maple syrup.

404
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,134
(cell phone rings)

405
00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:57,235
Man, your phone's ringing again.

406
00:16:57,236 --> 00:16:59,037
It might be important.

407
00:16:59,038 --> 00:17:01,906
Mike's phone,
Carl speaking.

408
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:03,441
Oh, hey, Molly.

409
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,377
Yeah, he's right here.

410
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:06,678
No, he's fine...
we're just hanging out,

411
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:08,680
enjoying my new apartment.

412
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:10,649
Stoned?

413
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:17,188
I don't think so.

414
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:18,690
Nah, it seems like
the same ol' Mike.

415
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:20,158
Pancakes!

416
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,193
Yup, same ol',
same ol'.

417
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:33,469
Well, somebody's already
slept through page one

418
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,472
of his birthday list.

419
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,975
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

420
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:44,346
♪ Happy Birthday
to you ♪

421
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:48,517
♪ Happy Birthday, dear Molly ♪

422
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:52,054
♪ Happy Birthday to you. ♪

423
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:53,789
Aw, you remembered.

424
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,292
Well, you left a great
big note on the fridge.

425
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:58,460
Well, that was actually
more for Mike.

426
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:00,863
Thank you.

427
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,264
By the way,

428
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:04,867
I am going to the college
this morning

429
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:06,902
to sign up for some classes.

430
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:09,705
Really? That's great.

431
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:13,442
I appreciate you
believing in me.

432
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:15,244
I'll try not to let you down.

433
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:18,580
You could never let me down...
you're my baby sister.

434
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:20,983
Well, I'm gonna do it.

435
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:23,519
I mean, if not now, when?

436
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,189
Besides I'm going to take
a history class and if I wait

437
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,858
much longer, there's gonna be
a lot more to learn.

438
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:33,796
Very true and very smart.

439
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,065
Love you.

440
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,133
Love you.

441
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,841
(door closes)

442
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:48,877
"To the best big sister
in the whole wide world."

443
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,480
Aw...

444
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:54,049
20 bucks?

445
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,886
No wonder the tightwad's
got 36 grand.

446
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,956
Croissants.

447
00:19:00,957 --> 00:19:03,559
Oh, help yourself.

448
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,094
But right when you get
finished with that,

449
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:07,029
we are going to
the art museum.

450
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,597
Art museum?

451
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:10,966
Cool.

452
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,906
Aw, you're still high.

453
