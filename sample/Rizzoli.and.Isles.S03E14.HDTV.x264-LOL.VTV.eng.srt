00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:03,521
My guess is Casey
dropped by to see you.

173
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:06,899
[ sighs ] Stop guessing.
You're bad at it.

174
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:08,526
He came by to see Korsak.

175
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:12,071
Oh, stop timing me.
I'll stop talking about Casey.

176
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:17,785
There are hilt marks...
there and there.

177
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:19,704
Those are probably from the knife.

178
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:23,499
- A small buck knife, maybe?
- Well, many knives have hilts ...

179
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:25,418
survival knives, hunting knives,

180
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,463
skinning knives, commando
knives, tanto knives.

181
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:29,631
Can you please stop?

182
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,508
Hmm.

183
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,221
Some kind of particulate
matter adhered to the wound.

184
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:42,310
- Well, that must have come off the knife.
- And white fibers ... there.

185
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:43,603
I'll have the crime
lab analyze all this.

[ cellphone vibrates ]

187
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:48,816
Okay, the victim's van is in the
evidence garage. I'll be back.

188
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:52,654
Will you think about
the, uh, "softball thing"?

189
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:56,783
- Yes.
- Thank you.

190
00:09:56,824 --> 00:09:58,910
Sorry, the answer's still no.

191
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:04,666
Korsak: We got a bunch
of cake-decorating stuff.

192
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:07,710
It's all covered with arterial
blood spray and car-wash suds.

193
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:09,045
Killer was smart.

194
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:12,632
He ruined any chance we had of
making a case with forensics.

195
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:14,342
Doesn't it seem a little
spur of the moment,

196
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:15,760
stabbing someone in a car wash?

197
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:18,638
Yeah.
I'll get it all photographed and tested.

[ police radio chatter ]

199
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:22,100
- Where's Frost?
- Well, the warrant came through.

200
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,830
He's working on Enzo's laptop

201
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,520
and still trying to
dry out his cellphone.

202
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:29,691
Okay, I'll have the crime lab

203
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:33,194
comparison-test all the
tools and knives in here.

204
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:36,698
Maura thinks that the
murder weapon had a hilt.

205
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:40,451
- This has a hilt.
- I didn't know he was coming.

206
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:43,204
Yeah, I figured.

207
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:47,041
He asked a lot of questions about you.

208
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,418
Really?

209
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:53,798
- Why did he leave Elsie?
- I'm taking care of her for a while.

210
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,883
He knew if he brought her by,
I couldn't refuse her.

211
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:57,969
You're taking care of her?
For how long?

212
00:10:58,011 --> 00:10:59,846
Maybe a few months.

213
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:02,140
- Why? Where's he going?
- He didn't go into details.

214
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:03,683
You're a Detective.
Didn't you ask?

215
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:07,437
- I didn't want to pry!
- Oh, that's so male.

217
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:15,903
- You think this is frosting?
- Maybe. Crime lab can test it.

218
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:17,864
Look, we got at least
several years' worth

219
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:19,365
of frosting and cake crumbs.

220
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,536
- What the hell is "fun-dant"?
- Fondant.

221
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:26,789
And it's sticky, sweet, inedible
crap that they put on cakes.

222

- Don't put it on retirement cake.
- Duly noted.

Ohh.
You're a good girl, Elsie.

Hey, Ma.

This is Detective
Frost's mother, Camille.

Oh. Nice to meet you.
I'm Angela.

Hi. Pleasure.

- You okay waiting here?
- Yes, yes.

231
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,404
And thank you so much
for taking us around.

- Sure. See ya, Ma.
- Bye, babe.

What a nice man.

He drove me and my roommate
and her son all over Boston

235
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:08,414
while we were waiting for Barry.

236
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:09,666
Yeah, he's a good kid.

237
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:13,169
And, uh, your son and my
daughter, Jane, are like this.

238
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:15,129
Oh.

239
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:18,007
I wish I lived closer.
I feel like I never see him.

240
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:21,552
- You live in, uh, Virginia, right?
- Norfolk.

241
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:23,972
I teach at one of the
military universities there.

242
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:25,765
Nice. What do you teach?

243
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:27,433
- Civil engineering.
- Wow.

244
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:30,645
Well, now we know where, uh,
Detective Frost gets his brains.

245
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:33,523
His father was actually
pretty smart, too.

246
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:37,652
Uh, we divorced 20 years ago.

- I'm not.

Well, anymore.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

250
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:47,745
Oh, no, thank you.

251
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:50,832
I think I already had
enough on the way here.

252
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:53,585
I'm actually trying to work up the nerve

253
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:56,462
to tell Barry that
I'm getting remarried.

254
00:12:56,497 --> 00:13:00,550
Oh. Congratulations.
Why is that making you nervous?

255
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,802
The divorce was hard on him.

256
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:05,513
And I never dated.
Well, don't get me wrong.

257
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:07,265
Barry is very respectful,

258
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:10,518
but knowing him, you know,
he has strong opinions.

259
00:13:10,553 --> 00:13:14,480
Well, we did bring them
up to have their own minds.

260
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:16,733
Yes, we did.

261
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:20,528
It's crazy how the
tables turn, isn't it?

262
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,697
I was seeing this guy for a while,

263
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:26,200
and, uh, my kids went nuts.

264
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:29,078
- What'd you do?
- Felt guilty.

265
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,082
But then I decided I was
allowed to be a person, too.

266
00:13:33,117 --> 00:13:36,878
- Yes, you are.
- Excuse me.

267
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:47,889
I think you need to complain
about your lunch order.

268
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:48,890
There's a phone in it.

269
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:50,433
Rice is an effective desiccant.

00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:53,978
Are you using three-syllable words
because your mother's in town?

271
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,606
Oh, man. I might be.

272
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:58,274

Can you make it work?

273
00:13:58,309 --> 00:13:59,734
I'm not sure.
Circuits are wet.

274
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:01,694
But I've been having
fun on Enzo's laptop.

275
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:04,697
He liked three things.

276
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:09,452
Let me guess ... women,
cakes, and BCU football.

277
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:11,246
What a life ... football,
women, and cake.

278
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:15,917
Enzo was a season-ticket holder.
And he also had every BCU game

279
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,127
from the last 10 years
on his hard drive.

280
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:20,296
- That's a serious fan.
- Dude was hardcore.

281
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:21,756
He watched every game
and a lot of replays.

282
00:14:21,798 --> 00:14:23,800
Pretty sure viewing football
on his computer didn't kill him.

283
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:25,843
Yeah, and I remember him
to be quite the ladies' man.

284
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:27,220
What about the women in his life?

285
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:34,185
Ho-ho-ho!
Nice assortment of desserts.

286
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:37,480
- I meant the cupcakes.
- Yeah, sure you did.

287
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:40,316
- Most of them are his old girlfriends.
- He hired his old flames?

288
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:43,236
Which flavor
would you choose, Korsak?

289
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:46,364
- Chocolate? Vanilla?
- So many cupcakes, so little time.

290
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,408
Okay, I'm about to
file a harassment claim.

291
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:51,786
- It has to be hostile and offensive.
- Keep talking.

292
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:55,373
Enzo updated his schedule
on this internal calendar.

293
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:59,544
Well, he posted he was going
to the car-wash fundraiser.

294
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:01,963
- Who had access to that calendar?
- Just his employees.

295
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:04,299
You mean just his ex-girlfriends?

296
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,341
Huh.

297
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:07,385
Check this out.

298
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:12,599
Hmm. "What I'd like
to do to my ex-boyfriend."

299
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,476
- Where'd you find that photo?
- She posted it on candidgram.

300
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:17,687
She posted selfies all day long.

301
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:19,063
Okay, who's Laura Stephens?

302
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:20,982
She looks like an employee.
I'll check.

303
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,028
She's 24. She's a cake
decorator at End Zone Cakes.

304
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:26,779
All right, well, come on.

305
00:15:26,814 --> 00:15:29,782
Maura's mad at me,
so let's give her a cheap thrill,

306
00:15:29,824 --> 00:15:32,035
and she can comparison-test
the cake knives.

307
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:36,623
Uh...
meet me at the elevator.

308
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:39,250
What's up?

309
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:41,169
You know how I drove Frost's
mom and her roommate around?

310
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,462
Yeah.

311
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:45,882
Well, I think they're, uh...
you know.

312
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:48,468
- No, I don't know.
- I think they're a couple.

313
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:51,137
What?!
Does Frost know?

314
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:54,223
Never mind.
Don't answer that.

315
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:55,224
It ...
it's none of our business.

316
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,977
No way he knows. She was
married ... to his father.

317
00:15:58,012 --> 00:15:59,604
Well, what makes you
think they're a couple?

318
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:03,775
- Jane, they're a couple.
- It's not of our business.

319
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,610
What's none of your business?

320
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,140
We were...
just talking about Ma. 

321
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:17,058
It sounded like you were
talking about her love life.

322
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,477
No. Menopause.

323
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,565
- We were talking about menopause.
- Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

324
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:28,486
It's none of our business
if Ma's in menopause. See ya.

325
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:31,656
- Ugh. You ready?
- Yes.

326
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:34,367
We should... get Maura and go.

327
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:47,255
- Boston homicide.
- What are you doing about Enzo?

328
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,674
- What's your name?
- Valentina Smith.

329
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:54,220
How could you let this happen?
Car washes are supposed to be safe!

330
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:57,098
Uh, what was
your relationship to him?

331
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,894
We went to college together.
I'm his office manager.

332
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:03,563
- Were you two involved?
- In college.

333
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:05,899
We haven't slept together in years.

334
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:09,277
- And where were you this morning?
- Delivering a wedding cake.

335
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,073
- We'll need to verify that.
- Whatever.

336
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:17,827
- I'm not about to kill my boss.
- We'd like to talk to Laura Stephens.

337
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,455
Everybody here was his friend.

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,749
We're working on a cake for
his memorial service now.

339
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:30,548
They're making the Boston Cambridge
University football stadium.

340
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,509
Oh, look! It's a little Enzo.

341
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,011
And this is a representation of heaven.

342
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,305
And I think that that golden ladder

343
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,140
- is so he can ascend.
- Uh, Dr. Isles?

344
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:42,894
- The comparison test?
- Oh, yes, of course.

345
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,983
Damn, Enzo liked them in all
shapes, sizes, and colors.

346
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:53,279
- Is that harassment?
- Possibly, yes.

347
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:58,118
You'll interfere with my
process if you come any closer.

348
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,286
We'd like to talk to
you about Enzo Womack.

349
00:18:00,328 --> 00:18:02,247
Can you just wait a sec?

350
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:03,790
Crap, you made me bump
the chin strap.

351
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:06,418
- Are these your knives?
- Don't touch them.

352
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,421
I'll need a clay impression
for a comparison test.

353
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:11,297
I didn't kill him, all right?

354
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:13,550
A woman definitely killed
that bastard, though.

355
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:14,843
How do you know
a woman killed him?

356
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,469
You think you can sleep with a girl,

357
00:18:16,504 --> 00:18:19,514
buy her brunch, whisper
sweet bullshit in her ear,

358
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,058
and then say,
"let's be friends, 'kay?"

359
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,394
You think you can do that
over and over?

360
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,104
We found this photo
you posted, Laura.

361
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,733
- It was a joke.
- It doesn't seem that funny to me.

362
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:30,775
Maura: Me neither.

363
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,321
- That looks pretty sharp.
- It's a flower pin.

364
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:39,167
You should talk to everybody.
Enzo strung us all along.

366
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,713
- No, not okay.
- So, why'd you work for him?

367
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:46,341
Do you know how hard it is to
find a decent job in this economy?

368
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:51,555
- I have a major in gender studies.
- Ooh. Yeah, I know what you mean.

369
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:56,059
Well, it seems to me that Enzo gave
you a reason to kill him, Laura.

370
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,561
He did, but I didn't.

371
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,022
I was at the gym.
You can check.

372
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:02,983
They take a picture when
they swipe it. I want it back.

373
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:04,902
I have to work out later today.

374
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:13,493
It's a shame that
Laura has a solid alibi.

375
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,080
Still, I think Enzo was
playing a dangerous game.

376
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,375
You think, uh, too many notches
on the bedpost got him killed?

Maybe.

Okay, Maura's finished
testing all the knives.

is not at that bakery.

So, it's nice that
Robin came with your mom,

381
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,762
you know, so she could
have some company.

382
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:35,599
My mom's really independent,
but, yeah, I guess.

383
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:36,934
How do they know each other?

384
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,561
They're both professors at the
naval university in Norfolk.

385
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:41,396
I didn't know
your mom was a professor.

386
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:43,190
My mom was in one of the first classes

387
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:44,900
at the naval academy
that allowed women.

388
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:47,152
- Are you kidding me?
- She's amazing.

389
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:48,612
She and my dad
were midshipmen together.

390
00:19:48,695 --> 00:19:51,281
That's how they met.
He had the career she should have.

Huh.

392
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:55,202
And they're roommates,
y-your mom and Robin?

393
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:58,163
After Robin's divorce,
they decided to share expenses.

394
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:00,123
Professors don't make that much.

395
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:04,002
Well, it's good they have each other.
I mean to ... to share expenses.

- Come on. Let's call it a day.

if I bring my mom?

Oh, so Frost's mom
is part of homicide?

All the identifiable organic substances

in the van were glucose-based
confectioner's compounds.

- And blood and glycerin from the soap.

- There was one exception.

It wasn't a lie.
We are old ladies.

So 2 for you,

00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,328
Um, coming!

504
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:00,624
Coming.
Coming. Okay.

505
00:26:05,462 --> 00:26:09,341
Hey.
Are you okay?

506
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:11,843
[ panting ]
Yeah. I'm fine.

507
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:14,262
Uh, come in.
Um, sit down.

508
00:26:16,848 --> 00:26:18,725
Can ... can I get
you a beer or...

509
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:22,145
- Maybe a water.
- A water. Okay.

510
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,855
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

511
00:26:26,942 --> 00:26:29,110
I remember the last time I was here.

512
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:34,574
Right before your last
tour in Afghanistan.

513
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:36,785
[ breathes shakily ]

514
00:26:36,868 --> 00:26:38,620
[ exhales sharply ]

515
00:26:38,662 --> 00:26:40,872
My final tour.

516
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:47,254
It's like the last run on a ski slope.

517
00:26:47,295 --> 00:26:48,964
You know as you're falling
you shouldn't have taken it.

518
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:58,431
Thank you for coming up.
I-I know you didn't want to.

519
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:03,228
I did. I ju...
I didn't want to be this close to you.

520
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,814
Casey.

521
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:12,696
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

522
00:27:12,737 --> 00:27:14,614
I asked Sergeant Korsak

523
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:16,950
to look after Elsie
because I'm having surgery.

524
00:27:16,992 --> 00:27:19,953
- Surgery? W-when?
- Soon.

525
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:22,831
- The stem-cell trials?
- No. I'm not a candidate.

526
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:24,374
I found a neurosurgeon.

527
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,043
He thinks he can remove
the, uh, shrapnel and bone

528
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,254
shards from pressing
against my spinal cord.

529
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:32,340
- Casey, that's incredible.
- There are no guarantees,

530
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:35,510
and, uh... and there
will be months of rehab.

531
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,721
But it's the first crack of light
I've seen in a pretty dark tunnel.

532
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,056
Well, let me ...
let me help you.

533
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:42,893
I-I want to go through this with you.

534
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:44,519
That's exactly why I
didn't get in touch.

535
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:49,232
Casey...
I-it doesn't matter, okay?

536
00:27:49,274 --> 00:27:52,193
- I care about you.
- No.

537
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,945
This is no way to start a relationship,

538
00:27:53,987 --> 00:27:55,822
and this is where we are ...
at the beginning.

539
00:27:55,864 --> 00:27:58,992
Okay, well,
let's get to the middle.

540
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:00,702
I want to do this.

541
00:28:00,737 --> 00:28:03,413
Taking care of an invalid
is an ugly form of intimacy.

542
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,998
There's no romance in it, Jane.

543
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:12,505
This injury isn't you.
This is you.

544
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:15,217
I should have asked you not to go.

545
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:18,887
I should have asked you to wait.

546
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:28,338
Did you see someone
else while I was gone?

547
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:33,610
Yes.

548
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:37,197
Did you care about him?

549
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:41,326
Yes.

550
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:47,832
- Then you'll find someone again.
- What? No.

551
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:49,501
Casey, wait a minute. Wait.

552
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:52,212
It's over with him.
It's ... it's been over.

553
00:28:52,254 --> 00:28:54,673
Look, I realized that
when I saw you again

554
00:28:54,714 --> 00:28:56,508
how much I want this to work.

555
00:28:56,543 --> 00:28:58,636
- This won't work.
- It will.

556
00:28:58,678 --> 00:29:02,097
Casey, please, just
give me a chance. Please.

557
00:29:02,138 --> 00:29:07,018
- Do one thing for me.
- Anything.

558
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:15,277
Let me kiss you...
and then let me go.

559
00:29:32,168 --> 00:29:34,254
Casey, please, please.

560
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:49,227
Goodbye, Jane.

[ knock on door ]

563
00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:22,368
- Where do socks go?
- All you need is a half-inch gap

564
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,746
for them to slip under
the agitator paddle.

565
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:28,166
So not sock heaven.

566
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,792
Check your drawers.

567
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:34,422
Static electricity causes them
to stick to other clothing.

568
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:36,674
I hope Enzo gets to
go to football heaven.

569
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:43,765
- Thank you for coming.
- Don't throw them away!

570
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:47,143
They don't have partners.
They're making me sad.

571
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:50,730
Okay.
Tell me what he said.

572
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:54,734
He is having surgery to
remove bone and shrapnel.

573
00:30:56,611 --> 00:30:58,738
What?
What's with the weird look?

574
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,741
- It's nothing.
- Hives, Maura.

575
00:31:01,783 --> 00:31:04,160

[ sighs ]
Okay.

577
00:31:09,415 --> 00:31:13,503
Casey's condition is called
cauda equina syndrome.

578
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:16,089
From what I've observed in him,

579
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,927
it probably involves T-11
and 12 and maybe l-1.

580
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:23,638
Same question ...
why the weird look?

581
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:30,019
Surgery on a partially impaired
paraplegic is very risky.

582
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:35,692
- Well, you're not a neurosurgeon.
- You're right. I'm not.

583
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,362
So no guessing.

584
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,366
I just want to pretend
like it's all gonna be fine.

585
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,579
- Can you do that with me?
- I can try.

586
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:55,962
Salute, Elsie. Good girl!
Good salute, Elsie.

587
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:58,214
- That wasn't a salute.
- Yes, it was.

588
00:31:58,256 --> 00:31:59,841
Looked like "shake" to me.

- We are nowhere.
- We better get somewhere

tear off some heads.

594
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,728
Maybe I can help.

595
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:13,771
Thanks to the
team-building softball game,

596
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:17,066
the crime lab stayed up all night
to get these results to you.

597
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,943
I thought they were helping
us solve murders because ...

598
00:32:18,985 --> 00:32:20,320
oh, I don't know...
it's their job.

599
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:23,489
The blue paint on the
floor mat is consistent

600
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:27,160
with the paint used for
the BCU field stencils.

601
00:32:27,202 --> 00:32:29,370
That's right where the
killer would have been.

602
00:32:29,412 --> 00:32:31,497
Frost, you said that
Enzo had season tickets.

603
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,167
- Was he at Saturday's game?
- No. His ticket wasn't used,

604
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,169
so I followed up with
his office manager.

605
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,796
- Enzo had to work on a wedding cake.
- It was the first game of the season,

606
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:42,842
which means Enzo didn't transfer
that field paint inside his van.

607
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:45,178
Maybe our murderer did.

608
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,056
I didn't mean anything when I
looked at it, but watch this.

609
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:52,185
Enzo was watching this
clip from Saturday's game.

610
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:54,812
<i>What kind of call is that?</i>

611
00:32:54,854 --> 00:32:56,814
Jane: Coach Phillips?
What do we know about him?

612
00:32:56,856 --> 00:32:59,525
Jane, what would be the motive? Enzo
hadn't played for him for five years.

613
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:01,819
Phillips was a contender for
a division I coaching gig.

614
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:05,573
It went away after BCU lost
that season five years ago.

615
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:08,660
<i>Am I disappointed?
Yeah, yeah, I'm disappointed.</i>

616
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,913
<i>Coaching a division
1 team is a dream of mine.</i>

617
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:13,206
<i>But, uh, BCU ...</i>

618
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:15,625
<i>we had a great run there [sighs]</i>

619
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:17,835
<i>Till Enzo hurt himself.</i>

620
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:19,587
Sounds like phillips blames Enzo.

621
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:23,216
Well, that blue paint only tells us
that our killer was on that field.

622
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:25,093
Frost, you get the phone working yet?

623
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,220
No.
Got to put the battery back in.

624
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,847
Okay, I want to see what
else Enzo was watching

625
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:31,766
the night before he was killed.

626
00:33:31,808 --> 00:33:34,811
- His laptop is in bric.
- Okay.

627
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:41,067
Sergeant Korsak, did Casey tell
you why he needed you to take Elsie?

628
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:43,820
No. He just said she might
need a home for a few months.

629
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:46,823
He mentioned something I
didn't want Jane to hear.

630
00:33:46,864 --> 00:33:48,449
What was that?

631
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,159
He made me promise I
would take care of Elsie

632
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:51,494
if anything happened to him.

633
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:55,540
- Hey, you guys coming?
- Yep.

634
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:02,171
Okay.
We got one shot at this.

635
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:05,174
If there's any moisture,
the circuits will fry themselves.

636
00:34:05,216 --> 00:34:07,844
- Turn it on.
- Do I have witnesses?

637
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:11,973
Sergeant Detective Korsak
is telling me to turn this phone on.

638
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,808
Turn the damn phone on, Frost.

639
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:19,188
I want it in writing that this
one is not on me if this phone...

640
00:34:21,316 --> 00:34:25,862
It's dead.
So much for your rice idea.

641
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:30,700
This is the whole list of
video files Enzo was watching.

642
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:32,202
Can you play that one?

643
00:34:34,913 --> 00:34:37,248
<i>BCU going for the money

strong sie and ... oh, no!</i>

646
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,631
<i>He's not getting up.
Folks, this does not look good.</i>

647
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:47,258
Ugh.
Why was Enzo watching that?

648
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,426
You see the right guard?

649
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,969
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

650
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,555
I didn't.
What are you talking about?

651
00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:55,266
<i>Let's see that again.</i>

652
00:34:55,308 --> 00:34:58,728
<i>The normally sure-footed right guard
looks like he slips on the turf.</i>

653
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,981
<i>And there goes hard-charging Der'on
Martin flying in at full speed.</i>

654
00:35:02,023 --> 00:35:04,817
<i>Enzo is down! Ouch!</i>

655
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,904
Frost, play that clip
from Saturday's game.

656
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:11,908
<i>Marcus to the right on a hand-off.</i>

657
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,493
<i>Oh! How did that happen?</i>

658
00:35:13,535 --> 00:35:17,017
<i>Looks like BCU's right guard
lost his footing and left</i>

659
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:20,500
<i>running back Jeff Marcus
unprotected for that nasty hit.</i>

660
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:22,919
<i>Ouch! It reminds me of that hit</i>

661
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:26,339
<i>that ended Enzo Womack's
carer five years ago.</i>

662
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:28,883
I think we just figured
out what got Enzo killed.

663
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:39,955
<i>Oh! That was a nasty hit. </i>

664
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:44,167
What? What did ...
what did you see?

665
00:35:44,168 --> 00:35:46,253
I'd like to know what got Enzo killed.

666
00:35:46,295 --> 00:35:50,465
Both BCU right guards, who
played five years apart,

667
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,301
faked the same trip on the same play.

668
00:35:52,336 --> 00:35:56,096
Frost: To make sure their running
back got tackled and didn't score.

669
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:59,433
This is like the day I took
that A.P. calculus exam.

670
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:01,410
You know, I couldn't
have solved that inverse

671
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,353
derivative problem if
my life depended on it.

672
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,063
Calm down.
Calm down, okay?

673
00:36:05,105 --> 00:36:07,524
For once, I get to
explain something to you.

674
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,693
Frost, can you freeze
both bad plays?

675
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:12,154
[ keyboard clacking, computer beeps ]

676
00:36:12,189 --> 00:36:14,615
That right guard and at
least one other player ...

677
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:17,784
probably the quarterback...
fixed that game in 2007.

678
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:22,289
Okay, and that right guard
fixed the same play five years later.

679
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:26,710
Are you saying BCU players from
two separate seasons threw games?

680
00:36:26,745 --> 00:36:30,255
Altered games. It's too easy
to get caught if you throw them.

681
00:36:30,297 --> 00:36:31,840
If you just shave points...

682
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:34,092
Frost, can we see both quarterbacks?

683
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,502
[ keyboard clacking, computer beeps ]

684
00:36:35,844 --> 00:36:37,522
Yeah, right there.

685
00:36:38,013 --> 00:36:39,265
Both quarterbacks
made identical signals.

686
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:40,724
That says to me,
"we're throwing the play."

687
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:42,977
Watch their eyes right
before they tap their helmets.

688
00:36:43,018 --> 00:36:46,188
Jane: Yeah, you're right.

689
00:36:47,391 --> 00:36:50,150
We have a shot caller ...
who are they looking at?

690
00:36:50,192 --> 00:36:53,988
Frost, do you have any other angles?
So, Enzo must have realized

691
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:55,364
the trip that ended his
career wasn't accidental.

692
00:36:55,406 --> 00:36:56,949
But why would the
right guard fake a trip?

693
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:58,367
Enzo was his teammate.

694
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,035
The players who were cheating
weren't trying to hurt him.

695
00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:01,537
They were just trying
to keep him from scoring.

696
00:37:01,578 --> 00:37:04,540
To change the over/under.

697
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:06,583
- That's what this is about.
- Of course.

698
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,544
What?
Over/under what?

699
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,838
Over/under is a type of bet.

700
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:13,340
Oddsmakers announce a number
before a game. It's their

701
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:15,801
best guess of what the
final combined score will be.

702
00:37:15,843 --> 00:37:18,220
And I can bet over
or under that number.

703
00:37:18,255 --> 00:37:20,055
- Yes.
- Okay, I think I understand.

704
00:37:20,097 --> 00:37:22,766
So if the teams' scores,
when added together,

705
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,935
are lower than predicted, I win.

706
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,105
Yes. And if you know that
there are dirty players

707
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:30,149
that are fixing the game
to keep the score down,

708
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,026
you bet on the under,
and then you win big.

709
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:34,069
Yeah, but why would
a college player cheat,

710
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:36,614
especially at a prestigious
academic university?

711
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,657
Well, BCU is a division 3
football program.

712
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:40,284
There's no money, no scholarships.

713
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:42,703
They're having a car-wash
fundraiser to buy equipment.

714
00:37:42,745 --> 00:37:45,664
Got another angle...
sideline camera.

715
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:49,918
Coach Phillips is the shot caller.

716
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,462
I don't think so.
Play it again.

717
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:57,301
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

718
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:59,345
Okay, play both the 2007
game and Saturday's game.

719
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:00,887
Watch Mackenzie.

720
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:10,773
You see that?
He dropped the towel both times.

721
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:15,486
[ cellphone chimes, beeps ]

722
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:18,697
Uh, the results are back on the
substance found in Enzo's wounds.

723
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:20,366
It's analgesic heat rub.

724
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:23,202
And the fibers I found were
from cotton sports tape.

725
00:38:24,787 --> 00:38:26,873
Maura...

726
00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:30,584
you said the murder weapon had a hilt?

727
00:38:30,626 --> 00:38:32,419
Could it be a multipurpose
tool, like this one?

728
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,382
Yes.
[ cellphone rings ]

729
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:38,217
Is that Enzo's phone?

730
00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:40,719
Okay, you don't get
credit for fixing it.

731
00:38:40,754 --> 00:38:41,845
- Give it to me.
- No.

732
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:45,891
- I can look at cellphones, too.
- Give it to me and let me plug it in.

733
00:38:47,101 --> 00:38:48,560
Thank you.

734
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:55,046
Here's his last text message.
To Dan Mackenzie, 7:54 A.M.

735
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:57,111
Right before he went to the car wash.

736
00:38:57,146 --> 00:38:59,071
"Need to talk. I hope I'm crazy.

737
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:01,657
I think coach has BCU
players shaving points."

738
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:04,285
- He thought his coach was dirty.
- "I hope I'm crazy."

739
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:06,036
We didn't want to accuse
the program he loved

740
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:07,621
unless he was sure he was right.

741
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:10,082
So he went to the person
he trusted the most ...

742
00:39:10,124 --> 00:39:12,626
his former teammate Dan Mackenzie.

743
00:39:12,668 --> 00:39:14,128
It shouldn't be so swollen.

744
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:17,339
How many times I got to tell
you to ice this sucker, huh?

745
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:21,844
Hey, you can't be in here.
There's no women allowed.

746
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:24,847
- BCU just made an exception.
- Well, what's this about?

747
00:39:24,888 --> 00:39:28,142
Frost: We checked your stats, Dan.
You were a good field-goal kicker.

748
00:39:28,183 --> 00:39:29,476
But suddenly, you started missing.

749
00:39:29,518 --> 00:39:32,563
- Was that when it started?
- When what started?

750
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:34,898
You were missing kicks to shave points.

751
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:36,108
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

752
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,694
We're talking about basic greed.

753
00:39:38,736 --> 00:39:41,989
Living pretty large for a guy making
$40,000 as a D-3 athletic trainer.

754
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:49,997
- I want a lawyer.
- You came up with this scheme in college,

755
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:52,875
but you knew Enzo wouldn't
cheat 'cause he was a good guy.

756
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,126
And he was going to
the pros. You weren't.

757
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:58,255
He ... he ... he was accusing
the team of cheating.

758
00:39:58,297 --> 00:40:00,633
He was gonna give the
BCU program a bad name.

759
00:40:00,674 --> 00:40:02,092
Enzo sent you a text
before you killed him.

760
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:05,554
He thought coach Phillips
was corrupting the players.

761
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:07,014
It never occurred
to him it was his friend.

762
00:40:07,256 --> 00:40:10,601
You're under arrest for
the murder of Enzo Womack.

763
00:40:23,906 --> 00:40:27,660
Hey.
What are you doing here?

764
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:32,164
I know you wanted me to pretend
that everything will be fine.

765
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:39,004
- What's that?
- It's some research I did

766
00:40:39,046 --> 00:40:42,633
on decompressive lumbar spine surgery.

767
00:40:42,675 --> 00:40:46,178
- I don't want to know.
- Jane, you need to know.

768
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,975
Why? I mean,
he said goodbye, Maura, so...

769
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:56,772
Jane, if you care
about him, you'll look.

770
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:02,569
How bad is it?

771
00:41:06,407 --> 00:41:07,716
Bad.

772
00:41:13,817 --> 00:41:19,214
- What am I gonna do?
- I wish I knew.

773
