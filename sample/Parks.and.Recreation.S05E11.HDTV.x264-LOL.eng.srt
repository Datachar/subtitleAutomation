1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,954
Well it's a pleasure
to be here, ladies.

2
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:04,575
I didn't think
anybody really cared

3
00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:06,611
about my time
on the city council.

4
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:09,280
Oh, we do. I mean,
you are such an inspiration.

5
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:11,315
Still going strong
at 82.

6
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:15,419
How old is that handkerchief?

7
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,171
Well, it's not a handkerchief.
It's a receipt.

8
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:18,656
[Groans]

9
00:00:18,658 --> 00:00:21,959
Paula Horke was Pawnee's
first female city councilor

10
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:24,545
40 years ago, and she was
a huge inspiration to me.

11
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:26,597
Women have come a long way
in Pawnee,

12
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:28,549
but we still have
quite a ways to go.

13
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:30,968
I mean, technically,
I'm not allowed to reserve

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,472
this conference room without my
husband or father's signature.

15
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:37,608
Government was a real
boys' club back in the '70s.

16
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,193
They smoked their cigars,

17
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:40,511
they snapped my bra,

18
00:00:40,513 --> 00:00:42,363
wore mirrors on their shoes

19
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:43,397
to look up my skirt.

20
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,899
Well, I am happy
to report

21
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:47,318
that it is now a pervert-free
people's club.

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,320
Well,
except for Councilman Dexhart,

23
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:50,905
who's a self-described pervert.

24
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:53,374
Yeah, and didn't Milton
try to kiss you?

25
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:55,076
Well, yeah,
things aren't perfect.

26
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:58,246
All the other councilmen
used to keep a calendar

27
00:00:58,248 --> 00:00:59,513
of my menstrual cycle.

28
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:01,031
Are you kidding me?

29
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,751
That is horrible.
They don't do that to me.

30
00:01:03,753 --> 00:01:05,136
Do they do that to me?

31
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:07,338
I once tried
to start a commission

32
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,007
to try to get more jobs
for women in city government,

33
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:11,475
and they dismissed me,

34
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:13,844
saying that it was because it
was just my time of the month.

35
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:16,347
Admittedly,
they were right.

36
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:17,982
Because of the calendar.

37
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:19,684
Manpigs.
All of them.

38
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:21,769
You know what, I'm gonna get
that commission going,

39
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:24,238
because this inequality
has gone on long enough.

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,223
You know what, I think
men are better than women.

41
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:27,608
She's kidding.

42
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,777
No, I'm not.
They provide for us,

43
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:32,380
and we must obey them
because they are our masters.

44
00:01:32,382 --> 00:01:33,881
April, stop it.

45
00:01:33,883 --> 00:01:37,668
Leslie, you'll never land a
beau with that domineering tone.

46
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,220
We must always walk
behind the men.

47
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:40,537
Sheugh.

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:44,258

Moustache!
Dumb-dumb!

52
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:05,896
- Hello.
- I just came

53
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:08,249
to drop off some
of the employee--

54
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:10,001
What is happening?

55
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:11,719
The girls are on break,

56
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,404
and their sitter
had to go out of town

57
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:15,339
for the day,
so I'm watching them

58
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:16,340
while Diane works.

59
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:18,292
I borrowed some markers
from Leslie

60
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:20,211
and some stickers
from Leslie

61
00:02:20,213 --> 00:02:24,548
and a Lite-Brite
which I got from Andy.

62
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,883
Girls, this is Ann.

63
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:29,303
Talk to Ann.
She's terrific.

64
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:31,389
Hey, dudettes.

65
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:34,392
You stoked about the weekend?
No.

66
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:37,928
Oh, look at this pwetty,
pwetty wittle beads.

67
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,563
They're not infants.

68
00:02:39,565 --> 00:02:41,932
I don't know.
I'm weird with kids.

69
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:46,120
So you guys like Coldplay?

70
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:47,271
You're weird.

71
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:49,106
You're...

72
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:53,160
Well, hey, girls.

73
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:54,161
No.

74
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:56,247
Okay.
Thanks.

75
00:02:56,249 --> 00:03:00,251
An equal gender
employment commission.

76
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:02,970
Leslie, I don't think
this is a good idea.

77
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:04,889
I think it's a fantastic idea.

78
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:06,123
Oh.
[Laughs]

79
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,624
I didn't know where you
were going with that.

80
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:10,127
The lack of women
in this government is criminal.

81
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:11,795
I'm gonna
ask each department

82
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:14,231
to send two people
to a meeting today.

83
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:15,766
- Yeah!
- And!

84
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:18,402
And--and I can ask
Shauna Malwae-Tweep

85
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:19,854
to write an article
about it

86
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:20,855
for the <i>Pawnee Journal.</i>

87
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:22,639
She's my special friend.

88
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:24,024
That's what you're
calling her now.

89
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:25,826
I don't know
what to call her.

90
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:28,446
I don't entirely understand
the behavior of young people.

91
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:31,866
Recently, we engaged in
something called a "group hang."

92
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:34,201
It was like a date, but there
were seven other people there.

93
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:36,120
It was very confusing.

94
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:38,456
I'm not really sure
what our label is.

95
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,791
Labels can be bad,
but they can also be good.

96
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:43,294
"Warning: Toxic bleach"
is a good label.

97
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:47,181
Shauna Malwae-Tweep
has amazing dimples.

98
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:49,433
- So the commission?
- Yes, right, the commission.

99
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:51,404
- I'm gonna get that going right now.
- Great.

100
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:55,189
Okay, I know this text
you sent me was a lie

101
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:58,109
and Michael Stipe
is not actually here, correct?

102
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:59,777
Correct.
That was a lie.

103
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:00,895
Yeah, no,
I knew it was.

104
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:03,197
I just couldn't
live with myself

105
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,231
if it had been true.

106
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,566
And that's
why I sent it.

107
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:06,817
Where's free Skittles?

108
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:07,902
Here you go, buddy.

109
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:09,236
- [Laughs]
- Aw!

110
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:10,287

[Skittles clattering]

112
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,862
Listen, I need you two

113
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:21,916
to teach me everything
you know about basketball.

114
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,818
Rent-A-Swag
is doing really well.

115
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,171
I'm on track to turn a profit
in my third month.

116
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:29,256
One problem: All the kids
that shop in the store

117
00:04:29,258 --> 00:04:31,041
are basketball crazy.

118
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:32,092
It's all they talk about.

119
00:04:32,094 --> 00:04:33,594
I need to be able
to schmooze them,

120
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:35,546
and I can't keep referring
to basketball players

121
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:38,098
as "Khloe Kardashian's husband
and his friends."

122
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
You're just the men
to help me out.

123
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:42,520
One jock,
one geek who loves stats.

124
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:43,737
I'll give you a few minutes

125
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:45,356
to cancel the rest
of your plans for the day.

126
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:47,691
No need. My only plan
was to buy Skittles.

127
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:50,327
- [Exhales]
- Wow, Chris.

128
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:54,865
Your gender equality commission
is a real sausage fest.

129
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:56,233
Oh, my God.
You're kidding me.

130
00:04:56,235 --> 00:04:58,569
I just assumed
that some of the departments

131
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,920
would send women.

132
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:02,289
Oh, my God.

133
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,374
I am part
of the problem.

134
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:05,042
Excuse me, everyone.

135
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:06,877
Did anyone notice
that there are no women

136
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,596
on the Gender Equality Commission?

137
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:11,015
Oh, there's a lady
right next to you.

138
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:12,516
Oh, wait, no.

139
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:14,385
It's just a very beautiful man.

140
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:15,586
Yes, okay,
we are gonna need

141
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:17,521
to rebalance this commission.

142
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:19,723
Listen, you did a great job
setting it up

143
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:21,392
and getting the snacks ready,

144
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:22,926
but we'll take it
from here.

145
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:24,979
Well, Councilman Milton,
I did put the snacks together,

146
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:26,397
and they are delicious,
I must say,

147
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,431
but that is not the point.

148
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:30,284
Round of applause
for the girl.

149
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,236
She has to leave
to get more snacks.

150
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:33,737
No, I don't!
This is my commission!

151
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:36,491
Ouch.
Why so ornery?

152
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:39,778
It's not the 7th yet.

153
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,415
Hm.

154
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:46,083
Your shoes
are red now.

155
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:47,968
- Yay.
- Hooray.

156
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,920
- [Giggles]
- Hey!

157
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:51,589
Both: Mommy!

158
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:52,723
You survived, huh?

159
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,227
Indeed, I did.

160
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:57,845
How were they?
Really?

161
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,730
Couldn't have
been better.

162
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:01,932
We had a wonderful time.
Well, that's good.

163
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:05,019
'Cause my sitter's
still out of town,

164
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:07,488
so I really hate
to ask you this,

165
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,724
but is there any way you
could take them again tomorrow?

166
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:12,359
Of course.
I'd be delighted.

167
00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:14,194
You're a lifesaver.
Thank you.

168
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:15,863
Girls, you wanna
spend another day with Ron?

169
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:17,114
Both: Yeah!

170
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:28,759
I believe one problem
with hiring women

171
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,378
is that they're frail
and breakable.

172
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,515
Is it possible you're thinking
about light bulbs?

173
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:35,633
- Or your hip?
- Mm.

174
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:38,269
If I were 300 years older, Councilman.

175
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:41,355
Incoherent ramblings aside,
I've done some research,

176
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:44,858
and the female employment rate
in government is abysmal.

177
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,127
The number one offender:
Sanitation.

178
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:48,779
All right!

179
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:51,014
No, no, no,
stop celebrating.

180
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:53,350
Why are there no female garbage
collectors, Steve?

181
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,486
I don't know.
We hire women for other things.

182
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:57,521
You have one woman,
and she's a secretary.

183
00:06:57,523 --> 00:06:59,856
And she's the best secretary we got,

184
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:00,991
except for Dan.

185
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:02,376
- Dan's awesome.
- Dan.

186
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:04,044
Garbage collectors
make good wages,

187
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:05,496
they have good benefits,

188
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:08,699
and they are the smelly glue
that keeps this city together.

189
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:09,700
You need
to hire more women.

190
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:11,385
Not that many women apply,

191
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:14,755
plus it's a very physically
demanding job.

192
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:17,508
Your average woman
can't handle it.

193
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,210
Oh, no?

194
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:21,712
Okay,
so I took extensive notes

195
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:23,230
on ways
to maximize our efficiency,

196
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:25,265
because we can't be just
as good as the men.

197
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,567
We have to be better.

198
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,152
Yeah, you're totally right.
Let's rock this.

199
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:29,770
April, I love you,

200
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:31,238
but I don't
need your sarcasm right now.

201
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,073
I'm serious.
Let's get rolling.

202
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:34,525
I wanna get
into some garbage.

203
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:35,609
[Knocks on metal]

204
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:37,945
What? I love garbage.

205
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:40,280
You ever found a dead body
in the trash?

206
00:07:40,282 --> 00:07:41,582
Or body parts?

207
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:42,733
Like, a torso
or a head?

208
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:44,118
Please say head.

209
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,403
Hey, Dewey.
Leslie brought binders.

210
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:47,738
[Laughter]

211
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,789
What do they say?

212
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,507
"Pick up garbage.
Put in truck"?

213
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,042
[Chuckling]
Actually, yeah.

214
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:53,577
That's what's in the binder
on every page

215
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,045
because I believe
in being thorough.

216
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:56,880
- All right.
- Okay.

217
00:07:56,882 --> 00:07:58,349
Let's do it,
trash people!

218
00:07:58,351 --> 00:07:59,683
Whoo!

219
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:16,885
Let's feed the beast!

220
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:06,472
Here you are.

221
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:08,691
I had to search the directory
for quite a while.

222
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,443
I thought your last name
was Hanson for some reason.

223
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:13,998
No, it's Perkins.
Always has been.

224
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,016
You seem more
like a Hanson.

225
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:19,568
Anyway, I have
the girls again today,

226
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,186
and they're asking
to play with you.

227
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:22,855
Really?
I thought they hated me.

228
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:24,123
No, the opposite.

229
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,491
I don't know
what you did to 'em,

230
00:08:25,493 --> 00:08:27,409
but it worked
like gangbusters.

231
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:28,577
Or they do hate me,

232
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:30,830
and you're just desperate
and tired.

233
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:32,531
Either way,
can you help me?

234
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,283
I'm out of activities,
and they're playing

235
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:35,718
with my land mine.

236
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,136
[Giggling]

237
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:39,638
This thing's cool.
What are these things?

238
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,926
Let's play
a word association game.

239
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:46,095
I'll say a word,
and then you say the first thing

240
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:47,146
that pops
into your mind.

241
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:49,381
- Okay.
- You.

242
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:50,983
- Reporter.
- Me.

243
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:52,935
- City manager.
- Us.

244
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:56,555
Ooh! Magazine.

245
00:08:56,557 --> 00:08:58,440
- [Sighs]
- Oh!

246
00:08:58,442 --> 00:08:59,608
According to Leslie's binder,

247
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,560
she and April are making
even better time

248
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:03,061
than the guys do
on a normal day.

249
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:04,196
Wow, that's weird.

250
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:06,115
You know, with us
being women and all,

251
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:08,000
you'd think our boobs
would get in the way.

252
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:09,668
Is that accurate
Mr. Phlegner?

253
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,070
Is Councilwoman Knope ahead
of the regular schedule for this route?

254
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:14,907
Whatever.
No comment.

255
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:16,876
- Tough stuff.
- Are you posing?

256
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:18,794
I don't have a photographer
with me.

257
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:20,129
Google Earth...

258
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,547
Always taking pics.

259
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:22,631
Let's move it out!

260
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,416
All right, let's start
with the basics.

261
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:26,018
Uh, why don't you just
play some one-on-one,

262
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,019
see if you can score?

263
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:28,521
Andy, guard him.

264
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:31,056
Eh, he's too big.
I can't see over him.

265
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:32,191
It's not fair.

266
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:33,392
I feel like everyone
should be the same size.

267
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:35,060
Okay, you have
to create space.

268
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:36,929
You gotta just
dribble around him.

269
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:38,364
- There you go.
- Now what?

270
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:40,432
Shoot!
Shoot the ball.

271
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:42,117
Did I do basketball?

272
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:43,903
Kind of.

273
00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:45,307
Try it again.

274
00:09:52,244 --> 00:09:53,581
Tommy for the dunk!

275
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,720
[Sighs]
[Screams]

276
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:03,389
My screen!

277
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:07,309
But it was actually
a blood-hungry witch

278
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:09,795
who was wearing
their mom's face like a mask!

279
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,296
[Shrieking]

280
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:12,781
[Laughs]

281
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:14,116
What is wrong
with you, woman?

282
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:16,969
Sorry. I thought kids
liked ghost stories.

283
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:19,021
Hey, girls! Did you wanna
look through my nurse kit?

284
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:22,107
Both: Yeah!
- Ooh, check it out, bandages!

285
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:23,242
We can wrap up the dolls,

286
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:24,610
and pretend they just
had surgery.

287
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:25,611
- Yeah!
- Awesome!

288
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:27,029
Yeah, or we can
use this hammer

289
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:28,146
and test reflexes.

290
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:29,748
- Yeah!
- Here, Zoe, watch.

291
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,650
- [Chuckles]
- Do me! Do me!

292
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:33,619
- [Chuckles]
- Do Princess Junebug now!

293
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:34,753
Okay.
You know what, Ron?

294
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:35,821
I can watch them
for a little while,

295
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:37,990
if you wanna...

296
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:39,508
Take a break.

297
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,163
This is
Stacy Knoblauch's house.

298
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:46,215
I went to high school
with her,

299
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:47,833
and she was super mean
to me,

300
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:51,169
and now I know
that she dyes her hair.

301
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:53,840
I knew that wench
wasn't naturally blonde.

302
00:10:54,842 --> 00:10:56,225
Oh, my God!

303
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:59,612
She has to use
prescription-strength deodorant.

304
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:02,815
This is the best day
of my life.

305
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:04,900
Hey, ladies, someone
just called in a pickup.

306
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:06,485
We have
to make an unscheduled stop.

307
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:07,820
Hope you
can handle it.

308
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:09,605
- It's not in the binders.
- A new challenge?

309
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:11,023
Bring it on, Stevie boy.

310
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:13,742
Whoo!
April, let's finish up!

311
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:15,627
We have some stereotypes
to overcome.

312
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:17,746
And some privacy
to violate!

313
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:18,747
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

314
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,532
[Bangs on truck]
Wait, no.

315
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:24,803
- Oh!
- Yes!

316
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:26,505
- Nothin' but net.
- Nice!

317
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:28,507
You are officially a baller.

318
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,042
I've been a baller
since birth, son.

319
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:31,760
Now, I'm an athlete.

320
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:34,229
Hey! You little chumps
wanna play some ball?

321
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:36,065
- Sure.
- Let's do this.

322
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:38,503
Watch out.
Tommy from half court.

323
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:43,522
This could really only
go poorly.

324
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,583
- He won't get out of my way!
- Tom--

325
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,056
Oh, my God!

326
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:07,096
- Yeah!
- Yes!

327
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:13,135
Tom, what the hell
are you doing?

328
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:14,603
I'm pivoting.
Ben told me to pivot.

329
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:16,088
I told you you
<i>can</i> pivot,

330
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,756
not that you
can <i>only</i> pivot.

331
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:19,525
Stop pivoting!

332
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,193
All right,
that's illegal.

333
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:22,928
I may not know much,
but you can't just

334
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,446
steal the ball
from another player.

335
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:25,931
Hey, aren't you the guy
who owns Rent-A-Swag?

336
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:29,034
- Yeah! Tom Haverford.
- You suck at basketball, man.

337
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:31,436
Well, you suck
at being polite, sir.

338
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:33,739
This has been fun, but we
have an actual game tomorrow

339
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:36,108
against guys
who can actually play.

340
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,576
Let's go.

341
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:39,080
Andy Dwyer
for the dunk!

342
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:43,999
Aw, that wall's so close.

343
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:47,302
Doctors, the operation
is now complete.

344
00:12:47,304 --> 00:12:49,388
Doctor Zoe, could you
please use the reflex hammer

345
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,622
to see if she's okay?

346
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:53,926
This is the most fun
I have ever had with kids.

347
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:55,177
They even said they
wanted to be doctors

348
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:56,294
when they grow up.

349
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:58,764
Hot tip for you baby-sitters
out there.

350
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:01,483
Let your kids play
with medical tools all the time.

351
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:02,801
- We have a problem.
- What?

352
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:03,936
Oh, my God.

353
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:05,971
Girls! This
is not a negotiation.

354
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:08,407
- Unlock the door immediately.
- No!

355
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:09,691
We're doing surgery!

356
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:11,460
Only doctors
are allowed in here.

357
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:13,078
Okay.

358

Stand back, ladies!

359
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:16,331
Ron, no, no, no, no!
That's dangerous!

360
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,916
Somebody in here's
gotta have keys, right?

361
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,084
I have keys.
Wha--

362
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:20,169
Jerry.

363
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:21,486
I never thought
I would say this,

364
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:23,005
but I am so glad
you're here.

365
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:25,207
Well, it's gotta be one
of these, right?

[Clears throat]

00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:29,595
- Oh, no.
- Ladies, no, no, no, no, no!

368
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:31,329
The patient
needs a haircut.

369
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:32,764
Her hair is infected.

370
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:33,849
- Hurry, Jerry!
- Okay, I'm trying.

371
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,167
- It's not this one.
- No.

372
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:37,335
Okay, I'm not good
under pressure like this.

373
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:39,104
Zoe, stop it, please!

374
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:42,024
- No!
- Zoe, put the scissors down.

on that truck right there.

380

Ah, easy,
breezy, beautiful.

381
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:57,456
That's the covergirl slogan.
I didn't mean to say that.

382
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,625
Okay, here we go!
On three!

383
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:01,493
- Okay.
- One, two,

- You need a hand?

389
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,636
No, no,
we don't need a hand.

390
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:13,088
What, you think Joan of Arc
needed a hand?

391
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,640
- Doing what?
- Let me tell you something.

392
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:15,891
We are not leaving

393
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:19,211
until this symbolic feminist
obstacle is loaded

394
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:21,096
onto that truck
of women's advancement,

395
00:14:21,098 --> 00:14:23,098
and you can put that
on the record, Shauna.

396
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,267
Well, you ladies clearly
have everything in hand.

397
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:26,818
Dewey and I
are gonna head back to base.

398
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,936
Hope we didn't throw you
off schedule.

399
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:30,222
- Not at all.
- Have fun!

400
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:33,358
Hey, Shauna, maybe not
put this part on the record.

401
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,060
You know, leave the earlier part
on the record,

402
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:37,029
but if we can't get this fridge
onto the truck

403
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:38,230
then maybe not
put that on the record,

404
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:39,831
and then just
destroy the record altogether.

405
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,200
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna go ahead

406
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:43,401
and decide what's on
and off the record on my own.

- Cool?
- Uhhuh.

The whole city is watching.

409

If I can't move that fridge
onto that truck,

410
00:14:49,677 --> 00:14:52,961
then feminism is over
in this town.

[Groans]

00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:01,420
I don't know why I thought
sneaking up on it would work.

This is the one.
This is-- Oh!

Why do you
have so many keys?

We did surgery
just like you taught us!

00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:11,331
Okay, you know what?

417
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,200
Why don't you girls
clean up all this hair,

418
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:14,417
and I'm gonna talk
to Ron.

- Let's cut off our toes!
- No, let's not.

I'm gonna take
this bag, too.

You need
to fix this.

00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,375
It's not that bad.
Nobody got hurt.

It's extremely bad!

of watching her children

without something
horrible happening.

What?

say you love Diane?

No.

maybe we'd be done in time

to this forever

get beat,

but they get back
out there the next day,

tomorrow.

dribbled up an idea.

No, double dribbled it.

00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,415
First of all,
everyone is fine.

526
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:51,584
No one got hurt,
but there was an incident.

527
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:53,788
Oh, my God.
What happened?

528
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,124
[Exhales]
Diane, this is all my fault.

529
00:18:58,126 --> 00:18:59,959
I let them go
into my nurse's bag.

530
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:01,794
[Laughs]

531
00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:03,263
[Chuckles]

532
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:05,231
Well, who has been
having fun with scissors?

533
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,232
Us!

534
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:08,068
Ann taught us
how to be doctors!

535
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,136
- Yay!
- You're not mad?

536
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:11,804
No, it's fine.
They're kids.

537
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:13,606
Once, Zoe put Ivy
in the dryer, so...

538
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:15,442
I'm still incredibly sorry.

539
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:16,943
I feel like
I let you down.

540
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:20,613
It is so sweet to me
how much you care.

541
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:22,832
This is why I love you.

542
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:23,983
Oh.

543
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:27,320
Well, I love you, too.

544
00:19:27,322 --> 00:19:28,488
[Laughs]

545
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,923
That's my cue.

546
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:31,324
All right, girls,
good hang.

547
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:32,792
Both: Bye, Ann!
- Thanks, Ann.

548
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:33,826
Oh.

549
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:35,545
Hey, Leslie!

550
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:37,547
Shauna just
sent me the disclaimer

551
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,665
that she's gonna use
before she prints the article.

552
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,934
"City manager Chris Traeger

553
00:19:40,936 --> 00:19:42,635
"was present
for this event,

554
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:45,338
and has a personal relationship
with the author."

555
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,689
Okay, that's
pretty good, right?

556
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:47,774
"Personal relationship."

557
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:49,893
It's not romantic.

558
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:51,844
But it is descriptive.
No, it's not even descriptive.

559
00:19:51,846 --> 00:19:53,196
I know you're not used
to this,

560
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:55,815
but maybe you should just try
to keep it chill

561
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:57,150
and see what happens.

562
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:58,568
Great advice.

563
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,869
Impossible to follow,

564
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,687
but great advice.

565
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:03,523
So do you think
the soup kitchen

566
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:04,624
could use that fridge?

567
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,692
I mean, April and I
were gonna haul it

568
00:20:06,694 --> 00:20:09,195
onto the truck effortlessly,
but if you need it...

569
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:10,914
Absolutely.
This is a godsend.

570
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,665
Thank you
for thinking of us.

571
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,800
Grab a side, ladies.

572
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:16,085
I think all of us
can get it on the truck.

573
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:18,221
Not only did we
complete the garbage route

574
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:20,140
and move an unmovable fridge,

575
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:21,508
but the Sanitation department

576
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,544
hired three new
female trash-haulers.

577
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:26,312
And, best of all,

578
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:27,564
April gave me this present

579
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:29,901
to commemorate
our feminist victory.

580
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,655
And it's trash.

581
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:36,823
It's filled
with trash.

582
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:38,525
Maybe there's something
on the bottom here.

583
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,160
Let me see--
No, just trash.

584
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,257
This is Brandon Turnbill
for <i>Kids' 46 News.</i>

585
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,927
I'm here with the star
of today's win, Josh Diamond.

586
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:49,729
What was the key
to the victory, Josh?

587
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:51,197
Well, uh, everything just
came together for us,

588
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:52,481
and we came out
on top,

589
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,033
and we're gonna try
to keep it going next week

590
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:55,384
against Snerling.

591
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:56,835
Thanks, tiny reporter.

592
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:58,855
It was a huge win
for Josh and the boys,

593
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:00,189
and after a huge win,

594
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:04,060
