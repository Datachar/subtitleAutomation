00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:03,815
(Jeremy) Mindy, I had the most
amazing encounter last night.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,584
I met a woman at the merch table

3
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:07,152
of a performance of <i>The Lion King.</i>

4
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:10,222
Let's just say
she felt the love last night.

5
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:12,038
Mindy, did a--

6
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:14,206
Oh, my God!
Oh, God, Jeremy, I'm so sorry.

7
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:15,841
<i>Wow.</i>
Jeremy, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

8
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:17,243
I forgot I was wearing this.

9
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:19,045
I spend so many nights here now,

10
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,146
and I'm scared of getting murdered.

11
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,380
So I figure, if I'm wearing this,

12
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:22,815
murderers will think I'm a murderer

13
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:24,116
and they'll just go, "Eh,

14
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,484
too many cooks
in the kitchen."

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,953
You know, you're here constantly.

16
00:00:26,987 --> 00:00:28,821
Well, my plan was to marry rich

17
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:30,489
and then stop working, or to marry old,

18
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:32,325
and then when the guy died,
inherit all his money.

19
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,493
But old guys think I have sass mouth.

20
00:00:34,528 --> 00:00:36,429
No, you're going about it
all wrong, Mindy.

21
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:38,364
I mean, yeah, it's hard
to mix work and love.

22
00:00:38,398 --> 00:00:40,666
But it's not hard to mix work and sex.

23
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:42,935
I like sex.
Tell me more.

24
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,004
Well, I had an hour between deliveries,

25
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:47,340
and I met this very nubile
Russian ballerina

26
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:49,075
at an Internet cafe.

27
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,210
Hey, man, don't tell me sex stories.

28
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:52,545
Oh.
I mean, tell me more about--yeah.

29
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,746
Come on.
All I'm saying is,

30
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,314
maybe you should consider a more,

31
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:57,083
I don't know, casual arrangement.

32
00:00:57,117 --> 00:00:58,451
I don't know.
Remember, we tried that,

33
00:00:58,485 --> 00:00:59,819
and it kinda sucked.
That wasn't casual for you.

34
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:02,455
You loved me.
Okay. I don't know that I loved you--

35
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,689
You were deeply
and fully in love with me.

36
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:05,691
I again--I think that--
No, it's okay.

37
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:07,226
All I'm saying is, if you want

38
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,761
to start enjoying life, skip the date,

39
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:10,396
<i>move on to the good part.</i>

40
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,900
[Screams] Ow!

41
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:16,836
Are you kidding me?
Why are you wearing that?

42
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,104
'Cause I don't want
to get murdered, Danny!

43
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:20,106
That doesn't clarify anything!

Hey, Danny.
Can you trade mouses with me?

47
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:38,524
Mine's all oily.

48
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:40,426
Wait, why are the midwives here?

49
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,561
Because this morning when I came to work

50
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:44,530
I was greeted by water
coming from my ceiling,

51
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:48,467
because their stupid water birth
tub exploded over the weekend.

<i>You know what this joker does?</i>

53
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:54,140
He gives me this <i>Healing Anger</i>
book by some new-age weirdo.

54
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:57,476
I suppose some would call
the Dalai Lama a new age weirdo.

55
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,612
Chinese communists, maybe.

56
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:01,681
Hi, Mindy.
Don't "Hi" me, Deslaurier.

57
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:03,182
Yeah, don't "Hi" her.

58
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:04,650
You might trick some of our patients

59
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:06,619
to defect to your sham midwife operation

60
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:07,987
that you have going on,
but you can't trick us

61
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,355
into saying hi to you.
Hi.

62
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,957
Hi. Damn it.
What do you say, Duncan?

63
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:14,427
Shall we take our oolong
and say so long?

Hi, Duncan.
Hey, Morgan.

67
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:23,069
Don't talk to him.
They're not our friends, Morgan.

68
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:24,704
I gotta check something in my file.

Psst.

71
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:37,149
Hmm?
I know that you're with officer Stassen right now,

72
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,852
but before that, did you ever engage

73
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:41,954
in anything kind of, like, casual?

74
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:43,589
People seem to be having
these awesome sex lives,

75
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,591
and I'm just trying to, like,
find a life partner

76
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,793
to go apple-picking with.
What's wrong with me?

77
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:49,595
Dr. L, are you thinking
about having a one-night stand?

78
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,263
'Cause, take it from me,
they are the pits.

79
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:52,565
That's okay, Morgan.

80
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,100
I wasn't really opening it up
to the floor,

81
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,768

No, no, I'm invested now.

82
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:57,328
Okay.
Listen to me.

83
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:58,404
You are too pure to be having

84
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,164
a bunch of gross sex with randos.

85
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,265
I was never--

86
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:02,600
You are like
a little baby deer, you know?

00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,135
You got little white spots on you,

88
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,403
and you're eating a bottle of milk,

89
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:08,939
and you got to wait
for your ten-point buck.

90
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:10,608
And then the two of you get married

91
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,276
under, like, a canopy in the forest,

92
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,544
and the rabbits are there,

93
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:16,046
and there's, like, a owl
who's the priest.

94
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:17,648
And I really want that.

club together.

you and I could meet up

About that thing that we were
talking about earlier.

105
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,204
Yes.
Laser hair removal

106
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:41,705
can be expensive,
but then you won't have

107
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,507
the shadow at least, which will help.

108

pick a guy for stuff.

111
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:51,882

is to find a man

<i>who you're attracted to...</i>
Okay.

113

Ugh.

119

Let's examine that "Ugh" for a moment.

120
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:12,870
It's actually
a very fascinating emotion.

121
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,972
It finds its roots
in an evolutionary fear

122
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,006
of contamination.

123
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,274

she tried this was in college,

148

and she got so freaked out

149
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,322
that she pulled the fire alarm
at the Hillel House.

150
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:20,658

Avi and I were sitting,

looking at CDs in his CD binder.

152
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,161
All of a sudden, he starts
massaging my shoulders.

153
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:25,596
I freaked out.
If I can give you

154
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,630
one piece of advice?
Yeah.

155
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:28,098
Don't wear underwear.

Can't he undress himself?

162
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:37,508
No, like he's a Christmas present

that you just can't wait to unwrap.

Okay, I can't believe
I'm agreeing with this,

00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,312
but it is so true, because every time

166

Just be careful with the seam.
Just go slack.

00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,835
Wow, my eye.

358
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,936
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

359
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:43,937
You knocked out my contact.

00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,339
What does it look like?

361
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:47,775
My contact?
It's a clear, round disc.

362
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,145
Okay. You don't have
to take that kind of tone.

363

I'm sorry.

366

I thought it would be sexy
to undress you.

I don't have a boyfriend.

No, Morgan, we're not--

but know that it's something
I really want.

00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:11,125
This isn't even a date.

409
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,594

[Quietly] Is this a

Yes.
Nope!

Excuse me.
Nope.

I'm talking to my friend in private.

Why don't you and Duncan
go to the arcade

416
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,577
or something?
The arcade is closed for rats.

417
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:32,146
Morgan!
It's not right.

418
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,547
Yes, okay, it might be a bad idea,

419
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,282
but sometimes you need to experience

420
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:37,017
the outcome of a bad idea.

421
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:38,519
Like you and train tracks.

422
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:41,655
I know it's wrong, but I gotta
have those smushed pennies.

423
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:43,357
Yes, and now I need
some smushed pennies.

424
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,025
Look, I won't tell anyone
about your Deslaurier

425

about my Deslaurier.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Your secret is safe with me.

427
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,897
Largely because I don't care,

428
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,931
and I'll probably forget.

429
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,899
Thank you so much.
Okay.

430
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,135

Oh, nice, candy straws.
Thanks, doc.

433
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:02,509
Hey, Duncan, you sure
you want to eat that, buddy?

They're delicious.
What are they, poison?

436
00:15:06,014 --> 00:15:07,381
It's made of corn syrup,

437
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:09,716
so I'd say, yes, that's
government-subsidized poison.

438
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:11,218
It's really good.

439
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,519
Okay, if you open the email, you die.

440
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:14,955
I was raised eating corn syrup,

441
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:17,090
and I think I turned out okay.

442
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,659

00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,300
this movie sucks,

It's in my duffel.

He needs to calm down.

469
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:12,633
There is a strong link between panic

and asthma, okay?

471
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:15,369
You can't just wave a dream catcher

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,813
The quarry.
What?

479
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:28,248
The quarry.
Good, the quarry. The quarry.

480
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:29,349
Describe the quarry.

481
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:31,418
It's nice.
It's got a lot of rocks.

482
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:33,720
A lot of lowlifes.
Not lowlifes. They're friends.

Well, they shouldn't be, Morgan.
No judging.

and say, "I'll always have
the quarry with me."
