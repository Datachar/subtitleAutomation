Okay, everybody.
I'll see you next week.

00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,281
(Claps)

11
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,559
(Indistinct conversations)

12
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,091
Isn't Reverend Timtom amazing?

13
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:24,843
Eh, beats grocery shopping
with mom.

14
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:26,400
Ever since I outgrew the cart,

15
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,556
it is much harder
to read and walk.

16
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:32,146
Hey there, Brick.
Can we rap a sec?

17
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,750
I can rap a second,
Reverend Timtom.

18
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,671
What's up?

19
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:35,545
Hello, Sue Heck.

20
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,303
I actually have a question
for Brick.

21
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:38,335
Oh.

22
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:40,358
You know, our Christmas
pageant's coming up--

23
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:42,625
"JC's Rockin' Birthday Jam."

24
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:45,112
And I'd sure dig it
if you'd be one of my wise men.

25
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:46,128
'Cause, Brick,

26
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,868
you're the wisest man I know.

27
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:48,813
Hmm.

28
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,497
Well, it is the holiday season,

29
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:52,138
and I'm not as busy
as I'd like to be,

30
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:53,422
so, sure.

31
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:55,672
Wait. I'm not as busy
as I'd like to be, either.

32
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:57,722
- Can I be in it?
- Aw, I'd sure love that,

33
00:00:57,844 --> 00:01:00,014
but it's only
for kids 12 and under.

34
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:03,173
Oh, pfft.

35
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:04,421
Cool.

36
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:05,730
Yeah. No prob.

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,664
But hey. Not to worry.

38
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:11,162
I saved a very important job
for you.

39
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:12,266
Really?

40
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:13,531
How would you feel

41
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:16,554
about makin' cookies
for the concession stand?

42
00:01:16,683 --> 00:01:18,617
Ha! I love cookies!

43
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,074
And concession stands.

44
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:21,753
I knew I could count
on you, Sue Heck.

45
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:22,875
And I'm really psyched

46
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:24,331
about you being
in the play, Brick.

47
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:26,917
What play?

48
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:33,560
Well, I've paid the minimums
on all the credit cards,

49
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:35,322
sent in
my first tuition payment

50
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:37,458
and conveniently
forgot to sign the check,

51
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,053
so I think it'll buy us
another week.

52
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,928
Attagirl!

53
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:44,080
And we still have $20 left
to buy Christmas presents.

54
00:01:44,226 --> 00:01:45,649
Okay, maybe a little more
than that,

55
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:49,059
but seriously, Mike,
not our best year.

56
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,242
Did we have a best year?

57
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:53,733
Well, we're just gonna have
to come with a way

58
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:55,296
to do Christmas on the cheap.

59
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:57,891
I mean, the kids are older now.
They'll get it, right?

60
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:00,785
Hey, maybe we give 'em
homemade gifts?

61
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:02,198
You know, from the heart?

62
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:03,609
They're still gonna
want presents.

63
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,474
Okay, well, how about we--
we go outside

64
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:09,028
and throw snowballs
and make snow angels

65
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:11,603
and create
a magical Christmas memory?

66
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:13,122
They're still gonna
want presents.

67
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,084
(Sighs) Okay. All right.
Go with me here--

68
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:18,894
I... fake my own death,

69
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,412
and then I just show up
on Christmas day--

70
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:21,962
"Surprise! I'm alive!"

71
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:23,420
"Glad you're not dead, mom!

72
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:24,829
Now where's my presents?"

73
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,353
Okay. We'll figure
something out.

74
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:28,184
Mm.
(Door opens)

75
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:29,748
(Dog barking in distance)
Guess what?

76
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:31,740
(Door closes) Reverend Timtom's
doing this cool Christmas pageant,

77
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,229
"JC's Rockin' Birthday Jam."

78
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:34,688
Brick's in it.
He's gonna be a wise man.

79
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:38,352
But get this--
I... am making the cookies!

80
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,532
Aah!

81
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,206
Brick's gonna be in a <i>play?</i>

82
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:44,053
And I'm making the cookies!
Ha! Can you believe it?

83
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,380
Yeah, wow, Sue.

84
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,976
So do you have a part?

85
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:47,908
I'm the wise man

86
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,165
who brings frankincense
to the baby Jesus.

87
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:51,739
I really wanted myrrh.

88
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:52,888
(Whispers) Myrrh.

89
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,086
Mom, where do you keep
the cookie cutters?

90
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:56,229
The store.

91
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:00,576
I don't know, Frankie.

92
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:01,901
Brick in a play?

93
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:03,430
In front of people?
People we know?

94
00:03:03,588 --> 00:03:05,816
I know. It doesn't sound
like a great idea

95
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,138
when you're just hearing it.

96
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,932
But who knows?
It could be his thing.

97
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,832
All those actors
in Hollywood are weird, right?

98
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:13,970
Brick's weird.

99
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,339
Yeah, he's definitely that.

100
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:17,814
I don't know, Mike.
I think he might surprise us.

101
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,165
- He won't.
- Wh--

102
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:22,433
(Lights clack,
dog barking in distance)

103
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:23,502
Where are you going?

104
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,536
I told Rusty I'd help him
move some furniture.

105
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:26,910
Yeah, 'cause everyone knows

106
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:29,552
the best time to move furniture
is when it's dark out.

107
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,076
I guess some friend of his

108
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,979
is giving him some old stuff
from his place,

109
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:34,610
and he wants
the stuff moved out

110
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:35,937
before he gets back into town.

111
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,729
This is ridiculous.
Seriously, Mike,

112
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:39,407
what is wrong
with your brother?

113
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:42,434
The "what's <i>not</i> wrong with him"
list is shorter.

114
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,486
(Sighs)
Hey, Axl. I was thinking.

115
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:46,607
What if this year,

116
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:48,131
we do something different
Christmas morning?

117
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:51,220
We wake up, rush outside,
make snow angels,

118
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,011
drink hot cocoa
with little marshmallows,

119
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:55,432
and create some
wonderful Christmas memories?

120
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:57,781
Cool. Then we come inside
and open presents?

121
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,771
<i>(Sports game playing on TV)</i>

122
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:02,167
(Sighs)

123
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:03,623
How about this lamp?
Is it going?

124
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:05,085
Oh, yeah, sure.

125
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,198
Is he giving you
the lamp or not?

126
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:08,640
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

127
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:10,539
(Dog barking in distance)

128
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:16,198
Ow. Ooh. Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.

129
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,387
Oh, man.

130
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:22,141
You still carrying that matchbox
car around in your pocket?

131
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:23,585
You've had that thing
since we were kids.

132
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:26,364
Oh, yeah, I like
to fiddle around with it

133
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:28,830
when I'm in line and stuff.
Nervous habit.

134
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,572
- Hmm.
- It's that or smoking.

135
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,976
Actually, it's that
<i>and</i> smoking.

136
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:39,031
Ah. And you said
it wouldn't fit.

137
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:40,586
Somebody owes me breakfast.

138
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:42,225
Yeah, I owe you.

139
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:44,061
Seem kind of crabby
tonight, Mike.

140
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,145
Uh, somethin' wrong?

141
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:46,681
Yeah, there's
something wrong, Rusty.

142
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:48,342
I didn't know we were gonna be
moving all this furniture

143
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:49,563
into my garage.

144
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,314
Oh. Well, we haven't
moved our old stuff

145
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,917
out of Marlene's yet.
I guess I forgot to tell ya.

146
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,900
Mm.

147
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:57,010
Okay, let's get
this garage door down.

148
00:04:57,123 --> 00:04:58,692
We wouldn't want people
knowing it's here.

149
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,759
Hang on.

150
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:02,249
Why wouldn't we want people
knowing it's here?

151
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:03,902
This is your stuff, right?

152
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,685
Oh. Yes.
I won it fair and square.

153
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:08,333
What do you mean, you "won it"?

154
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:09,677
Well, uh, me
and a bunch of the guys

155
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:12,435
were playin' poker,
and I called acey deucey.

156
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,570
Sure, I had a lot
of corn nuts in my mouth,

157
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:16,049
but everybody heard me.

158
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:18,332
Uh-huh. And if you asked
the guy we took it from,

159
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,062
- what would he say?
- Oh, he'd say we stole it.

160
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,391
And what would the other people
at the table say?

161
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:23,858
Well, they'd probably
side with him.

162
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:25,378
You know how cops
stick together.

163
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:27,963
You telling me
we broke into a cop's house

164
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,864
and stole his furniture?
Are you nuts?!

165
00:05:29,988 --> 00:05:31,951
Now look, any jury
that plays poker

166
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,204
would side with me.

167
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:35,522
I'm not keeping this stuff
in my garage, Rusty.

168
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:36,732
It's going back now.

169
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,688
Oh, I can't now.
I gotta get the truck back

170
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,720
before the guy who owns it
finds out it's missing.

171
00:05:40,825 --> 00:05:42,156
So you stole a truck, too?

172
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:44,807
Well, he'd say that,
but he owes me.

173
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:47,408
You know those guys
that take and take

174
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:49,187
and never give back?

175
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,468
Yeah. I think I do.

176
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:03,017
Okay, I figure 20 cast members,
2 parents each.

177
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:05,197
Siblings, 1.5 grandparents,

178
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:06,713
crew members, church people,

179
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,780
5% accidental crumblage.

180
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:11,262
Okay, I am going to need...

181
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:14,269
1,200 cookies. Ha ha!

182
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:16,123
Sue, quilt.

183
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:17,397
Aah! Sorry.

184
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,512
(Door squeaks) Ugh.

185
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:27,111
So... guess who got hired
at JJ Macky's?

186
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,979
Why do people say "guess who"?
I know it's you.

187
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,995
(Sighs) Can't you just
have fun with this?

188
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:33,265
Look, they're hiring
extra help for the holidays.

189
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:34,130
And the best part is,

190
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:36,443
I get
an additional 30% discount

191
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,459
off their already
low, low prices.

192
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:39,598
Oh! Yep!

193
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:42,413
We're gonna score our kids
some Christmas presents, baby.

194
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:44,106

Weird.

202
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:02,483
Hi, uh, Penny?
I'm Frankie.

203
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,523
It's my first day. I guess
we're gonna be working together.

204
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:06,525
Oh, well,
welcome aboard, Frankie.

205
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:08,115
Oh, you're gonna love
working here.

206
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:10,551
We like to think of ourselves as a big ol' family.
(Cash register beeping)

207
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:11,838
(Laughs) Oh, great.

208
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:14,400
So just picking up
a few things on my break.

209
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:15,648
I'm getting this
for my daughter.

210
00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:17,047
She loves rainbows.

211
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,601
And my son's been wanting
this clock radio

212
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,045
that projects the time
up onto the ceiling,

213
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:23,240
'cause I guess it's too much

214
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,244
to roll over
and see that it's noon.

215
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:26,634
(Laughs) Right.

216
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:29,873
All right.
Okay, that's $78.96.

217
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:32,183
Ooh, hold on. I think
you forgot my employee discount.

218
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,777
Oh, yeah, that doesn't
kick in for 20 days.

219
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,551
20 days?

220
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:39,472
That's all the way
up to... Christmas Eve.

221
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,730
Yeah, I know.

222
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:42,172
See, people used to
take these jobs

223
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:43,676
just so they can
buy their presents,

224
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:46,000
- and then quit.
- What?

225
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:47,310
Well, that's not me.

226
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:49,443
If anything,
I wanna be a lifer.

227
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:51,274
Uh-huh. There's nothing
I would like better

228
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:54,358
than to just grow old
and die here.

229
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,588
Well, if you do,

230
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,524
we all sign a vest, frame it,

231
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,116
and give it to your family.

232
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:01,335

What are you doing?

249
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:44,233
Chillin' in my new crib.

250
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:46,556
Your "crib" is full
of stolen furniture.

251
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:47,921
Hey! It's not stolen,

252
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,404
'cause Uncle Rusty
called acey deucey.

253
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:50,877
Now could you close
the door, please?

254
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:52,531
I'm not paying
to heat the world.

255
00:08:54,552 --> 00:08:57,134
<i>Well, the days until Christmas</i>
<i>were going by fast,</i>

256
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,481
<i>and so were all</i>
<i>my Christmas presents.</i>

257
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:02,041
I'm not sure about the size,
but this is the only one left.

258
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:03,305
How do I look?

259
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:05,984
Fat.
I mean, you're not fat.

260
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,542
The sweatshirt
makes you <i>look</i> fat.

261
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:10,720
And that rainbow pattern?
A little young for you.

262
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:12,768
It is a little young for me.

263
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:14,902
I'll get it for my niece.

264
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,910
Ooh, a clock radio.

265
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:22,065
<i>My hopes of a discount</i>
<i>Christmas were fading fast.</i>

266
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,778
<i>All I wanted to do</i>
<i>was kick up my feet</i>

267
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:25,554
<i>with a can of frosting.</i>

268
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,823
<i>But Sue had already used up all my
cabinet frosting.</i> (Packaging rustles)

269
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,840
<i>So I had to go deep</i>
<i>into my reserves.</i>

270
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,701
(Scoffs) Seriously?

271
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,564
Coming together, right?

272
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,029
Masculine,
yet with a touch of whimsy.

273
00:09:42,402 --> 00:09:44,313
Oh, uh, your frosting's
not there.

274
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:46,021
I put that and your other stuff
in the back,

275
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:48,029
'cause it was an eyesore.

276
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,837
Oh, and, uh, instead of
a new amp for Christmas,

277
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:52,169
I'd like an accent rug.

278
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,925
You know, really help
define the space.

279
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:56,208
Yeah, well,
don't get too comfy,

280
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,024
'cause it's all going back.

281
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:02,121
You know, that kind of attitude
is why I moved out! (Door closes)

282
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,809
<i>So while Axl was enjoying</i>
<i>his uncle's stolen furniture,</i>

283
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:08,120
<i>Mike was busy</i>
<i>trying to return it.</i>

284
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:09,597
What is this?

285
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:11,642
How are you gonna
take the furniture back

286
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:12,900
in that clown car?

287
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:14,886
Oh, I think
if you stack it right...

288
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:15,940
Damn it, Rusty!

289
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:18,099
You can't keep doing this!
Enough!

290
00:10:18,265 --> 00:10:19,537
You're driving me crazy!

291
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:22,307
You're irresponsible,
unreliable.

292
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,717
You're possibly a felon!

293
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:26,363
Hey, hey, hey. I think
you're being unreasonable.

294
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,476
I spent the whole morning
rounding this car up,

295
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:30,176
putting $2 of gas in it,

296
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,293
which I'm not even
gonna charge you for.

297
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:35,099
A "thank you" might be nice.

298
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,355
Okay, Sue, time to
shut down the cookie factory

299
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,458
I gotta rummage through
the fridge for dinner.

300
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:44,535
Oh, that's okay.
We already have dinner plans.

301
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:45,958
Yeah, we're going
over to Axl's.

302
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,747
Should never go over to
somebody's house empty-handed.

303
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:51,781
I'm done.

304
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:53,349
- What do you mean?
- I'm done.

305
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,807
I'm done with my brother.
It's over.

306
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:56,310
I told him not to come
for Christmas.

307
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:58,031
Wow. You did?

308
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:00,182
If he were a friend, I'd have
been done with him years ago!

309
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:01,698
I get nothing out of it
but headaches!

310
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,558
And I don't want to hear
"you do for family," Frankie.

311
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,459
I did enough for him.
I'm done.

312
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:08,434
Okay, then.

313
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,127
Okay.

314
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:20,897
Oh, no.

315
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:22,888
I forgot about cookies
for Christmas dinner!

316
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,024
How many people are coming?

317
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:25,339
Are grandpa
and Uncle Rusty coming?

318
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:28,335
Whoever's comin' is comin'.
Whoever isn't, isn't. (Bottles clank)

(Mouths words)

320
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:32,526
Well, I'm not
wise man number two anymore.

321
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:34,290
Oh, Brick.

322
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:36,759
I'm wise man number two
<i>and</i> number three.

323
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:39,306
Turns out wise man three
has a bit of a shoving problem.

324
00:11:39,443 --> 00:11:41,074
So my new line is,

325
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:43,771
"I bring you frankincense,
and he brings you myrrh."

326
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:45,867
Wow, Brick, that's great!

327
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,645
Two parts.

328
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,823
They must think you're
doing a really great job.

329
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,870
<i>And</i> you get to say "myrrh"
like you wanted.

330

Oh, it's the invitation

333
00:11:59,696 --> 00:12:01,262
Didn't you get one?

334
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,199
Hmm.

335
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:04,723
Awkward.

336
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:08,727
Hey.

00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:30,751
You don't fail
when you do your best.

521
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:32,611
Anyway, I'm headed
up to Bloomington.

522
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:35,832
They have this big interfaith
snowball fight on campus

523
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:38,240
where they work out
thousands of years of conflict

524
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:39,981
in a fun, safe environment.

525
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,263
Would it be cool if I took
some of your delicious cookies?

526
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:45,516
Yes. (Laughs)

527
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,183
I just wish
there was more of 'em.

528
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:50,473
Oh, well, I have
a thousand more in the car.

529
00:19:50,612 --> 00:19:53,071
I mean that. A thousand.

530
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:55,796
(Crunches)

531
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:58,552
Brick! Hey.

532
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:00,470
So what happened?

533
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:02,571
You seemed a little
distracted up there.

534
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,575
Really?

535
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:04,836
- Mm.
- Yeah.

536
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:07,073
For the whole second half,
you faced the back of the stage.

537
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:09,292
Hmm. Well,
I gave it a whack.

538
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:10,511
(Whispers) Whack.

539
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:11,694
(High-pitched voice)
Whoop.

540
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:13,959
(Laughs)
Dude, that was awesome.

541
00:20:14,102 --> 00:20:15,678
(Laughs) This thing was
a total suck-fest

542
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,974
till you showed up, seriously.

543
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,572
You rocked it. That
shoe-squeaking was hilarious.

544
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:21,553
Thanks.
I saw it on a TV show

545
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:24,084
where guys in shiny shorts
ran up and down a floor,

546
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,824
and I really liked
the squeaking sound.

547
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,940
Brick, that was
a basketball game. (Chuckles)

548
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:30,771
Yeah, it was. Up top.

549
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:33,382
(Laughs) Come on.
One more. Is that all you got?

550
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:35,215
Whoop. Nope. Not this time.

551
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:38,287
No-- oh. It's okay, one more.
No! Sorry.

552
00:20:38,423 --> 00:20:40,855
<i>And at that moment,</i>
<i>Mike realized--</i>

553
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:43,185
<i>Brick was Axl's weird brother.</i>

554
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:46,497
<i>And it'd kill him if he ever</i>
<i>thought there would come a day</i>

555
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:49,395
<i>when they would stop</i>
<i>speaking to each other.</i>

556
00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:53,570
(Sighs) I'm telling you, man,
it's a golden opportunity.

557
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:54,892
I don't know, Rusty.

558
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,387
Come on, Mike, how many llamas
can I put you down for?

559
00:20:57,514 --> 00:21:00,192
(Paper crackling)

560
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:02,964
- What is this?
- Mom?

561
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:03,897
Is this a joke?

562
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:06,412
Okay, those are from
the JJ Macky Christmas mailer,

563
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:08,818
and they represent
presents to come.

564
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:11,442
(Gasps) A Camaro? Awesome!

565
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:13,159
Uh, turn it around.

566
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,128
A shirt?

567
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,867
<i>So Mike and Rusty made up.</i>

568
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,141
<i>It wasn't that hard,</i>

569
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:22,856
<i>'cause Rusty hadn't realized</i>
<i>they were even in a fight.</i>

570
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:25,732
<i>And I made up for Christmas day</i>
<i>the day after Christmas,</i>

571
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:29,460
<i>with 50% off</i>
<i>plus my employee discount.</i>

572
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:32,208
<i>Yep, the Heck family</i>
<i>cleaned up.</i>

573
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,930
<i>I think we may have</i>
<i>a new family tradition.</i>
