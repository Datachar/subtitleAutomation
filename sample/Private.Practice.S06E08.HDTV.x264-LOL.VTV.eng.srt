1
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:06,599
Morning.

2
00:00:06,668 --> 00:00:09,536
It's day 182
of project cooplets.

3
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:13,305
We're at 26 weeks. Multiples are
usually born around 32.

4
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:18,477
So I'm savoring every
last minute of this pregnancy.

5
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:22,181
I mean, just look
at my gorgeous wife.

6
00:00:22,248 --> 00:00:23,949
I know what you're thinking.

7
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:26,251
How did I get so lucky?

8
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:27,953
I swear, I have no idea.

9
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:32,356
All I know is that this is what
I've wanted my entire life--

10
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:37,228
to take care of my pregnant wife
and a house full of kids.

11
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:39,798
Oh.

12
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:44,468
You know, I'm really not much

13
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:47,071
of a morning person,
but there's so much to do now,

14
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:48,538
it's really all about
multitasking.

15
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:52,176
The babies are the size
of lettuce this week.

16
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:53,977
You know,
there is an app for that.

17
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:55,713
Brain development has kicked
into high gear,

18
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,248
so it's important that Charlotte
get all the right nutrition.

19
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:00,117
And yes, sometimes
when I give her her vitamins,

20
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,785
she throws them at me,
but I don't take it personally.

21
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:04,286
This is what I can do
to contribute

22
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:07,356
while she is doing all
the heavy lifting, literally.

23
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:12,528
Yes!

24
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:14,663
Breakfast is Charlotte's
least favorite meal,

25
00:01:14,732 --> 00:01:17,532
so I like to give her
plenty of options.

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,533
Thanks for making
me pancakes, dad.

27
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:22,303
You got it, Mase.

28
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:25,073
Rise and shine, beautiful.

29
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:26,842
Time to get up.

30
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,378
Enough
with the damn breakfast buffet.

31
00:01:33,248 --> 00:01:34,882
It's too early.

32
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,117
I let you sleep
as long as I could.

33
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:37,517
No, Coop.

34
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:40,087
My water just broke.
The babies are coming.

00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:52,932
_

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,433
You knocked me up.

38
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:57,036
My guys prevailed.

39
00:01:57,104 --> 00:02:00,940
Sweetie, we're having a baby,
you and me?

40
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:02,408
We're having a baby.

41
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:04,677
No, Cooper.

42
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:07,612
We're having <i>three</i> babies.

43
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:11,383
Three? Three babies.

44
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,951
That...

45
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:15,654
Is amazing. I'm-- Wow. Okay.

46
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,922
I can't react.
She-- she doesn't want one.

47
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,857
She's definitely
not gonna want three.

48
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:22,960
But I'm totally excited.
You get that, right?

49
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:24,461
Wow.

50
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:25,863
That's one word for it.

51
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:29,934
I can think of a few others,
all four letters.

52
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:31,535
Are you okay?

53
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:33,504
No. You heard me, right?

54
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:34,972
Three babies.

55
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,873
I know when the night
of conception was.

56
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:39,109
- We were in the shower, and she
did this thing... - No, I'm not all right.

57
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:40,811
- And then I did this other thing... - This
thing's supposed to be 99.9% effective.

58
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:44,042
...and I made sounds come out of her
that you do not hear in nature.

59
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:45,715
I was the man.

60
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:47,918
How hard it's gonna be to take
care of three rug rats?

61
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:50,220
Okay. I know it's a lot
to take in.

62
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:52,855
Is it okay that
I'm a little bit excited?

63
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,290
As long as you don't expect
me to be.

64
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:56,192
Ugh.

65
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,863
_

66
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,431
Okay.
This is gonna be awesome.

67
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:03,866
You've seen
plenty of ultrasounds.

68
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,500
Not when they're our kids

69
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:07,069
and not when
they're the size of plums.

70
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:09,603
Oh, come on, Charlotte.
You know you're excited.

71
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,505
All ultrasounds look the same.

72
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:14,108
They're like the sketches
of "America's Most Wanted."

73
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:15,977
You can't identify someone
from those.

74
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:17,979
All right.
There they are.

75
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,780
There's baby one,

76
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:21,615
baby two...

77
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:23,852
Oh, you see it, right?
Those are clearly our kids.

78
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,585
She has no idea
what she's talking about.

79
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:26,820
Hi, kids.

80
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:28,455
I made you.

81
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:29,689
This means I can't go
to the urology conference

82
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:31,325
in Spain in October.

83
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:33,760
We're not gonna be able to go
to Hawaii for Christmas.

84
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:34,995
Oh, come on, Charlotte.
You're pregnant.

85
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:36,496
You're not terminally ill.

86
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:38,198
I'm gonna be a double-wide
with feet.

87
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:39,967
More of you to love.

88
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:42,168
Look, all three look great.

89
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:44,703
You said with triplets,
one of 'em might not make it.

90
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:46,339
No, what I said was that
with multiples,

91
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:49,041
there's a 53% chance
of spontaneous reduction,

92
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:51,610
but since that usually happens
in the first trimester,

93
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:53,512
you are almost in the clear.

94
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,214
Yay for me.

95
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,415
Look, there are inherent risks
with carrying triplets to term.

96
00:03:57,483 --> 00:04:00,085
We should go back to my office
and talk about it.

97
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,452
I have to get back
to the hospital.

98
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,521
No, what you need to do
is hire a new ER doc

99
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:06,057
and focus on the plums.

100
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:13,430
_

101
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:17,601
Sorry.

102
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:20,070
I'd, uh, just as soon
keep this to myself,

103
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:22,006
but since that's not possible,

104
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:23,740
I'm, uh,

105
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:25,075
I'm pregnant...

106
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,477
with triplets.

107
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:28,578
- Wow.
- That's so wonderful.

108
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:30,013
- Congratulations!
- That's so great. Yeah.

109
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,615
Okay, who already knew?

110
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:34,017
Time-out. If there's
a time and a place to lie,

111
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:35,618
it's right here and right now.

112
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:37,720
And don't you dare lie
to a pregnant woman.

113
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:40,790
Let's go, people.
Show of hands.

114
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,628
- Ow! - Is it impossible for you
to keep your mouth shut?

115
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:48,897
- You told Addison.
- She's my doctor.

116
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:50,966
- What's your excuse for telling Violet?
- Doesn't count.

117
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,968
- Thanks, Coop.
- You know what I mean.

118
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:54,869
- I'm sorry. I told Jake.
- But only so she could pick my brain

119
00:04:54,938 --> 00:04:56,704
about pregnancy with multiples.

120
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,673
I saw Cooper trolling
the Internet for baby names.

121
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:00,342
And not that you asked,

122
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,843
but your kid will be pantsed
every day if you name him Otis.

123
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:04,111
And Coop was asking me

124
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,047
when Naomi started wearing
maternity clothes.

125
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:07,748
- Mm.
- You think I look fat?

126
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:09,883
No, you look beautiful.

127
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:11,953
Beautiful and fat,

128
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,321
but beautiful.

129
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:15,189
I may be the last one to know,

130
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:17,757
but this is fantastic news.

131
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:21,027
Seriously. New life.
You-- you must be so excited.

132
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:23,596
I'm excited about the odds
that my body might absorb

133
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:25,765
- at least one of these freeloaders
before birth. - That's terrible.

134
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,567
- That's terrible.
- That's Darwin.

135
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:28,768
Survival of the fittest.

136
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:30,103
You gonna find out the sex?

137
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:31,371
Well, the ultrasound
won't be definitive

138
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,006
until closer to 18 weeks.

139
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:34,440
If this technically wasn't
a high-risk pregnancy,

140
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:36,075
I wouldn't want to see
another ultrasound.

141
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:38,177
I mean, I want the mystery of
that. I want the anticipation.

142
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:40,379
I want to know
as soon as possible.

143
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:43,015
But I mean, it would be awesome
if it was a surprise, right?

144
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,017
I am pregnant with triplets.

145
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:46,919
That's surprise enough
for a lifetime.

146
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:51,189
So we're having triplets.

147
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:53,692
Great.
Congratulations, man.

148
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,095
I threw out almost everything
or donated it to charity.

149
00:05:57,162 --> 00:06:00,499
But I still have
Pete's toothbrush.

150
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:03,167
- I can't stop thinking about babies...
- I haven't touched it.

151
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:06,269
But babies are life, and Violet
wants to talk about death.

152
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:08,672
I need to focus.
I need to focus on death.

153
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,240
And I just stare at it
every morning...

154
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:11,675
- It sounds wrong, doesn't it?
- In the bathroom.

155
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:13,243
I don't know.

156
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,412
I mean, I know he's not actually
gonna come back to use it,

157
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,649
but it just makes me
feel better to see it there,

158
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,350
next to mine on a sink.

159
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:21,485
Whatever works, right?

160
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:22,819
That's right.

161
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:24,587
Don't you think--

162
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:26,189
I mean, shouldn't you be
talking to someone?

163
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:27,357
I'm talking to you.

164
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:28,658
Come--

165
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:30,860
I mean-- I mean,
I have grief group,

166
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:33,330
which sort of helps.

167
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:35,565
I guess. I don't know.
Look, I mean,

168
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:38,134
Pete is dead, and, um...

169
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,438
and that sucks.

170
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:44,907
It's gonna suck
until it doesn't.

171
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:47,910
Oh, I'm so sorry, Vi.
Okay.

172
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:50,079
She's mourning the loss
of her husband,

173
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:52,281
and he was my friend.

174
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:55,883
I just can't go there right now.
I am in baby land.

175
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:57,785
I mean, I want to be doing
cartwheels, which is funny,

176
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:00,288
'cause I've never done
a cartwheel in my whole life.

177
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,124
I need to stop this.
Okay, her husband is dead.

178
00:07:03,192 --> 00:07:05,293
I cannot show her my baby glee.

179
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:09,431
I need to smile and nod
and pretend I'm listening.

180
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,199
Okay.

181
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:13,900
Thanks. Thanks, Cooper.

182
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:16,770
- For what?
- For listening.

183
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,372
- All right.
- All right.

184
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,107
- I'm gonna be late for my group.
- Okay.

185
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:26,345
She thanked me for listening.

186
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,381
I wasn't listening.

187
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,383
I'm a bad friend.
I mean, she needs help.

188
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:34,187
She is suffering,
and I'm... just an ass.

189
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,489
I mean, go.
Go-- go be with Violet.

190
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,459
Seriously, I'm good. Go.

191
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:42,827
Violet?

192
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,028
You're not in grief group.

193
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,897
Gabi, hi.

194
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,332
Uh, yeah, I was
checking on a patient.

195
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,000
Guess I lost track of time.

196
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,868
Oh, me, too.
I was visiting Ally.

197
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,604
I didn't know
she was at St. Ambrose.

198
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:56,408
Yeah. This is like my second
home. I'm here every day.

199
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,275
You know, I read to her,
play music.

200
00:07:58,343 --> 00:07:59,776
You know, just let her know
I love her.

201
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:01,412
That's really nice.

202
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:06,517
Well, if we go now,
we won't be too late.

203
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:08,986
Is it awful
that I wanna play hooky?

204
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,155
Oh, God. No.

205
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:13,491
It's hard, the work
that we do over there.

206
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:16,126
Yeah, it's also hard to hear
over Kasey's sobbing.

207
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:19,362
That's terrible.
I'm sorry.

208
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,697
No, just the actual number of
tissues that she uses, you know,

209
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:24,066
like a whole box, really?

210
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:25,301
What about the rest of us?

211
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:26,469
Yeah,
but it's also that there's

212
00:08:26,537 --> 00:08:27,837
a kind of pecking order,
you know?

213
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:30,339
I mean, I know I'm entitled
to miss my girlfriend,

214
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:34,709
but her son was like,
what, 26 when he died?

215
00:08:34,777 --> 00:08:36,077
How do you compete with that?

216
00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:37,646
You play hooky.

217
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,284
Do you want company?

218
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:43,852
Okay, everything looks good.

219
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,654
The first trimester tests
came back

220
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:48,489
negative for trisomy 13 and 18,

221
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:50,124
which means it's unlikely
that the kids

222
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:51,925
will have
any chromosomal abnormalities.

223
00:08:51,993 --> 00:08:54,128
We can go ahead and do an amnio
at 16 weeks to be sure.

224
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:56,696
Sounds great.

225
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:57,930
Right, char?

226
00:08:57,998 --> 00:08:59,266
Fantastic. Are we done?

227
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,201
No. No. We have to discuss
your options.

228
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:03,002
No, I know my options.

229
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,272
I'd like to hear the options.

230
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,407
With multiples,
there's a very high probability

231
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:11,710
of preterm delivery, resulting
in low birthweight infants,

232
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:13,712
- which are at risk.
- I know what they're at risk for.

233
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,681
A dead mother.
That's what they're at risk for,

234
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:18,250
because I just may kill her
right now.

235
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:19,851
The problem is,
she's carrying my babies,

236
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,220
so I guess I should wait.

237
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:23,322
Ideally,
we want to get to 32 weeks.

238
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,990
That gives the babies
the best chance.

239
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,492
Anything before 26 weeks,

240
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,858
and you're looking
at the possibility

241
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:30,061
of cognitive
and neurological impairments.

242
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:31,462
Great. Got it.

243
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,830
You did your job.

244
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,272
She has to understand the risks.
Can-- can you talk to her?

245
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,140
Tell me what we need to know.

246
00:09:57,855 --> 00:09:59,288
Can't sleep?

247
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:01,957
Ah, bloodsucking ticks are
giving me heartburn.

248
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:04,993
Can't wait till
they keep me up kickboxing.

249
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:06,395
Anything I can do?

250
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,864
Hmm. Go back in time,

251
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:11,734
wear a condom.

252
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:16,838
So I was talking to Addison
this afternoon after you left.

253
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:19,241
And with triplets,
you're looking at a lot

254
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:21,610
of possible
obstetric complications.

255
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:24,679
Remember when you asked if there
was anything you could do?

256
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:26,180
Stop talking.

257
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:28,283
You're at risk
for preterm labor,

258
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:29,917
premature ruptured membranes,

259
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:31,852
gestational diabetes,
preeclampsia,

260
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,355
and postpartum hemorrhaging,

261
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:36,323
which means you could die,
Charlotte.

262
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:39,226
Cooper, I'm a doctor.
I know what I'm at risk for.

263
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:41,328
Oh, my God. I take back
the whole killing her thing.

264
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:43,063
- Okay?
- Quit being so dramatic.

265
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:44,197
Is it gone?

266
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:46,233
Quit being so dramatic.

267
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:49,469
I think we need to talk about
selective reduction.

268
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:51,704
How many times do I have to say
I don't need to hear this?

269
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:53,606
Reduction from triplets
to twins,

270
00:10:53,674 --> 00:10:55,841
decreases the risk
of severe prematurity

271
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:58,745
and the risk
of losing the whole pregnancy

272
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:00,680
falls from 15% to 4%.

273
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:01,914
I won't abort.

274
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,352
You were hoping that one of them
would be absorbed anyway.

275
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,520
What's the difference?

276
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:10,689
Absorbed is
my higher power at work.

277
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:12,857
Abortion is me making the call.

278
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:15,860
Selective reduction
isn't exactly abortion.

279
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:17,562
It's a shot to the heart
of a fetus

280
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,097
with potassium chloride.

281
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:20,964
You know how you pick?

282
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:23,901
Whichever one's closest.
That's who gets the needle.

283
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:26,604
I'm not doing that.

284
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:30,107
I have to pee.

285
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:41,250
Okay, that's horrible,

286
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,320
but if losing one means
you can save two,

287
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:47,990
if losing one means Charlotte
would be okay? I don't know.

288
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:50,393
I don't know. I'm the dad,
so I should have a say,

289
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:54,763
but right now mom's doing
all the hard work.

290
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:59,401
It's Charlotte's body,
it's her life, it's her choice.

291
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:03,572
But I can't lose her and
I don't want to lose any of my babies.

292
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:08,443
So what the hell do I do?

293
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,812
What do I do?

294
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,382
Cooper.

295
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,251
We told Mason he was
having three siblings.

296
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:22,357
Then Mason's having
three siblings.

297
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,409
_

298
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,948
Wow. They have
a lot of strollers here.

299
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,583
Yes. Oh. Here you go.
Look at this one.

300
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:51,020
No. Baby in the front
will be 3 miles away.

301
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:52,787
I won't be able to see it.
Someone could snatch it

302
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,656
and I wouldn't know till,
like, an hour later.

303
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:57,058
- Well, I-I can help.
- She's insane. Right? I mean, it's 3 feet.

304
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:59,293
Unless she's legally blind,
she'll be able to spot danger.

305
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,295
- ...with one of the babies. - You're
gonna make a hell of a big brother.

306
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,297
Can I help you folks?

307
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,200
Yes. We are looking
for strollers, but, um,

308
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:07,901
there's a lot to choose from.

309
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:10,737
We have some excellent models,

310
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:13,339
but the truth is, it's really
best to carry the baby

311
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,408
and hold them close.
I did that with mine.

312
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,744
Yeah, well, I'm pregnant with
triplets,

313
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:20,547
so how do I hold all three
at the same time?

314
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:23,616
Do you put one in a basket
on your head? Or-- or maybe

315
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:25,484
with three it doesn't really
matter if I drop one

316
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:27,419
now and again,
'cause I've got spares.

317
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:29,421
- Oh, good. She's making friends.
- You don't really mean that, right?

318
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:31,190
I'll bet this lady wishes
she called in sick today.

319
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:33,625
- I can carry one.
- Thank you for your help.

320
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:35,527
Uh, we'll let you know
if we need anything. Thanks.

321
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:37,930
With my luck, she'll be waiting
for me in the breast pump aisle

322
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:40,231
so she can tell me how
she nursed all of her kids

323
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:41,499
until they're 27.

324
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:44,736
- Ew! People really do that?
- No.

325
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,604
When you're pregnant,
everyone's got an opinion,

326
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:48,439
and they all
wanna offer advice.

327
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:50,274
Okay, does someone need
a hug? Three...

328
00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:51,910
- Two...
- One.

329
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:54,545
Who's cranky?

330
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:57,948
You can let go.

331
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:00,350
- You can stay.
- Okay.

332
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:05,789
You didn't talk about Lucas
in group today. How's he doing?

333
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:08,625
He doesn't ask about Pete
anymore.

334
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:10,828
I'm worried that he won't
remember his dad,

335
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:13,229
but sometimes I think
that's better.

336
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:16,365
Sure. If you don't remember,
there's nothing to miss.

337
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:19,102
Maybe that's what I need--
amnesia.

338
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:22,671
Although I'm already
starting to forget things.

339
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,773
Like what?

340
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:25,674
Our first date, Ally and I went

341
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:28,243
to this hole-in-the-wall
restaurant in Mexico

342
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,978
while we were working
down there.

343
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:31,980
I was writing
for National Geographic.

344
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:34,649
She was taking the pictures.

345
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:37,018
I've been racking my brain
for the past three days,

346
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,354
but I can't recall
the name of the place.

347
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,256
Ally would know.

348
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:44,258
But she hasn't
answered me in a while.

349
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,626
I am so sorry.

350
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:48,629
I can't imagine
how hard this is for you.

351
00:14:48,696 --> 00:14:52,666
I keep hoping that
I can will her to wake up.

352
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:55,936
None of the doctors can agree
as to when that might be.

353
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:59,839
But as long as a chance exists,

354
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:02,008
I can't give up.

355
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,276
I won't.

356
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:10,583
They are beautiful!

357
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:13,019
Oh, my-- I'm so excited
for you guys. This is amazing.

358
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:15,454
Amazing? I can't have
too much coffee.

359
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:17,856
I can't eat sushi. I'm supposed
to watch my mercury levels

360
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:20,058
and be on the lookout for
toxoplasma, listeria, E Coli.

361
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:21,726
Yeah, she should keep
complaining to Amelia...

362
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,929
about pregnancy because
it must've been really fun

363
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:25,664
to go through the nine months

364
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:27,499
and then give birth to a baby
with no brain.

365
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,268
...and even herbal tea.
Herbal tea.

366
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:31,270
And then the damn shopping
has to get done

367
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:32,636
before they get here--

368
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:34,371
the bottles, the diapers.

369
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:35,706
And what the hell's a layette?

370
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:37,474
I can't even go
to the store anymore, though,

371
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:40,611
because I'm so gassy and itchy--
my boobs, my bump.

372
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,348
I don't have time for this crap.
I have a job. Two jobs.

373
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,851
You know, if we threw you
a shower--

374
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,618
- No.
- Come on. Think about it. It could be fun.

375
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:51,188
Charlotte hates showers.

376
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:52,923
Mostly she hates the women
that <i>have</i> showers...

377
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,357
because they're all <i>that</i> woman...

378
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:55,825
You know, the ones that think
the world needs to stop

379
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:57,393
because they're pregnant,

380
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:59,061
like they're the first ones
to ever do that.

381
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:00,896
...sugary baked goods.

382
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:04,033
I hate showers.
You know who has showers?

383
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,935
<i>That</i> woman--
the one I hate,

384
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:07,370
the one who thinks
the world's gotta stop

385
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:08,904
because she's having a baby.

386
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:10,005
Like she's the first
one to ever do it.

387
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:12,474
Okay, first of all,
there is no danger

388
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,108
of you ever becoming
<i>that</i> woman.

389
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:18,112
Second, you do realize that you
need everything in triplicate.

390
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,448
So if I throw you a shower,

391
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:20,549
you won't have to worry
about any of it.

392
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:21,883
I'll register for you,

393
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:22,951
and by the time the babies
are born,

394
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:24,353
you'll have
everything you need.

395
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,155
So you can be gassy
in the comfort of your own home.

396
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:28,322
So really,
you're just buying me stuff?

397
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,258
Okay.

398
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:37,231
What she meant to say was
"thank you."

399
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:41,134
_

400
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:44,236
20 minutes for you, 30 for me,

401
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,272
and ten minutes for
"American Bake Off."

402
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,107
- Uh...
- Okay, I'll give you five in "Bake Off,"

403
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:51,778
but my 30 is nonnegotiable.
I need every minute of it.

404
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,145
What are we talking about?

405
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,247
Us, commiserating
about our lives

406
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,383
over corned beef on marble rye.

407
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,618
Right. Lunch.

408
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,819
I totally forgot.

409
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,087
Did you forget?

410
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,421
- Of course not.
- You forgot.

411
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,990
I forgot.

412
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,825
And Addison's about to do
Charlotte's ultrasound

413
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,160
- in, like, ten minutes.
I didn't tell you that? - No.

414
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,063
Oh, my God.
Please don't let her be mad.

415
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,264
I mean, I just can't handle that
right now.

416
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,600
I just want to see
my little sweet potatoes.

417
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,900
You're not mad, are you?

418
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,167
I'm furious.

419
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:18,970
Yeah, blow off
your wife's ultrasound

420
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,738
and have lunch with me.

421
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,143
You know, if you still want one,
we can do an amnio.

422
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,344
No.

423
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:28,646
I realize that there are
associated risks,

424
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,214
but I do know what I'm doing.

425
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:33,149
Oh, it doesn't matter. Even
if an amnio tells us each kid

426
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:36,519
has two heads and is covered in
gills, they're still our babies

427
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:39,522
and they'll stay our babies.

428
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,991
Mm.

429
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:43,793
Hi, King-Freedmans
or Freedman-Kings.

430
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:45,361
Did you miss me?

431
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:47,963
Well, how could they miss you?
You talk to 'em every damn day.

432
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,865
I read in one
of the pregnancy books

433
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:51,734
that if you talk
to your children every day...

434
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:53,902
they're more secure
and well-adjusted.

435
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,638
I don't know. At least
they'll know me right away.

436
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:57,339
Is hiding behind the other two.

437
00:17:57,406 --> 00:17:59,642
It is pretty crowded in there,

438
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,978
but your <i>girls...</i>

439
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:04,846
- Look good.
- Girls?

440
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:06,447
- All three of 'em?
- All three of 'em.

441
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:09,416
Girls are awesome!

442
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:10,584
Oh, my God!

443
00:18:11,854 --> 00:18:13,187
- Oh, man!
- Oh!

444
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:16,758
What the hell am I gonna do
with three girls?

445
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,873
Charlotte?

446
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:37,346
You okay?

447
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:38,480
It's 7:00 P.M.

448
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:40,182
I'm tired.

449
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,984
I'm always tired.

450
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:44,720
It's because
I don't sleep anymore.

451
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:47,623
Everything's tight.
My socks are tight.

452
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,090
My towels are tight.

453
00:18:49,158 --> 00:18:51,192
The freaking mangoes are
making me miserable.

454
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,895
You'd never know because she's
so shy about her discontent.

455
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:56,097
Really keeps it all inside.

456
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:58,499
And I'm doing this for girls.

457
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,034
Why do they all
have to be girls?

458
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:01,136
Girls are awesome.

459
00:19:01,203 --> 00:19:02,971
You were a girl.

460
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:05,239
Ah.

461
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:07,808
Girls...

462
00:19:09,077 --> 00:19:11,344
are silly and stupid.

463
00:19:11,412 --> 00:19:13,013
When they turn 12,
we're giving them away

464
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:15,582
because 12-year-old girls make
Stalin look like Gandhi.

465
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:19,919
Sure, they're disgustingly sweet
to their daddies,

466
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:24,190
but girls hate their mamas
from puberty to at least age 20.

467
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:28,261
Mm. The only thing that's worse
is when they become women.

468
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:32,064
Sure, they'll talk your ear off
about sisterhood

469
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:33,866
while simultaneously
stabbing you in the back

470
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:36,201
and sleeping with your husband.
Women are awful.

471
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:38,170
You're not awful.
You're perfect.

472
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:40,105
And you will raise them
to be just like you.

473
00:19:40,173 --> 00:19:41,673
Mm.

474
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,608
And then hopefully,
they will each meet a man

475
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:46,912
as patient and selfless
as I am.

476
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,546
Although, I probably won't let
them date until they're 30

477
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:50,715
because before I was selfless
and patient,

478
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:52,917
I was a man-whore who knocked
a woman up in a parking lot

479
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:56,620
and met my wife on a sex site.

480
00:19:56,688 --> 00:19:59,824
I have my work cut out for me,
don't I?

481
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:02,193
Thanks for taking a look.

482
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,493
I know that ally's
on life support,

483
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:05,162
but what are the odds
that she--

484
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,798
No, there are no odds.
Ally has no cortical activity.

485
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:09,966
I'm gonna have a hard time
imagining

486
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:12,268
any doctor saying otherwise.
I mean, she's brain-dead.

487
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,305
She's not waking up ever.
I'm sorry, Violet.

488
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:17,440
What are you doing?

489
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,843
Hey, Gabi.
Uh, this is Dr. Shepherd.

490
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,078
She's a neurosurgeon
and a friend.

491
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:23,912
I didn't ask you
to get another opinion.

492
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,915
No, I realize that. But I just
thought that since she's here--

493
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,985
Get out, both of you.

494
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,061
_

495
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:40,328
All right, what about this one?

496
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:41,996
There's a swimming pool
in the back,

497
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:44,431
a 6-car garage,
and 8 bedrooms.

498
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:45,900
Okay. How much?

499
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:47,735
$15 million.

500
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:50,671
Is-- is that too much?

501
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:52,940
No, not if we win the lottery.

502
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,177
Okay, what about this one?
See, five bedrooms,

503
00:20:57,245 --> 00:20:58,378
big backyard.

504
00:20:58,445 --> 00:21:01,014
We could build a tree house.

505
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:08,088
I thought I'd surprise Charlotte
with a house.

506
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:09,622
Who am I kidding?
This is Los Angeles.

507
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,557
We can't afford a house
for this brood.

508
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,393
Maybe if all the kids
share rooms.

509
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,028
Will their friends
make fun of them

510
00:21:16,096 --> 00:21:18,197
for not having their own space?
Maybe they won't have friends.

511
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:20,032
Maybe if we don't buy
the $15-million house

512
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,134
with the pool,
they'll be shunned.

513
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:25,637
It doesn't just happen
with the amish, right?

514
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:27,773
It kinda looks haunted.

515
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,208
Oh. Yeah.

516
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:32,043
Well, the good news is,
if you have to share your room

517
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:34,279
with a ghost, he won't
take up much space.

518
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:42,253
Hey, when the babies come,

519
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:45,455
are you gonna like them
more than me?

520
00:21:45,523 --> 00:21:47,391
Mason.

521
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,192
I mean, it happens.

522
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,194
People like babies.
Babies are cute.

523
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:52,595
I spend a lot of time
with babies,

524
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:54,431
and they can be
quite disgusting.

525
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:55,933
They got bald,
little pointy heads.

526
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,767
All they do is eat, sleep,
poop, and cry.

527
00:21:57,835 --> 00:21:59,936
I mean, you're way more fun
that that.

528
00:22:00,003 --> 00:22:01,003
Really?

529
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,239
Really. And besides,

530
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:05,474
we're gonna be the only dudes
in that house.

531
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:07,410
We gotta stick together.

532
00:22:07,477 --> 00:22:08,978
Right?

533
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:11,880
Our survival depends on it.

534
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,888
Welcome, mommies and daddies,

535
00:22:20,957 --> 00:22:25,160
to the incredible journey
of childbirth.

536
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:27,295
Let's start with
some breathing exercises.

537
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:29,331
Dads, prop up your wives

538
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:31,833
so they can focus
on their diaphragms.

539
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,334
Just like that.

540
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:34,835
Good. Get comfy.

541
00:22:34,902 --> 00:22:36,403
Okay.

542
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:39,340
Now take a slow, deep inhale
through the nose.

543
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:42,876
Followed by a long, slow exhale

544
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,212
out through the mouth.

545
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,181
Like these people really
don't know how to breathe.

546
00:22:48,248 --> 00:22:51,184
Breathe in love...

547
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:52,818
and breathe out fear.

548
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:55,221
Ugh.
For crying out loud.

549
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:56,722
It's hard for me
to breathe in love

550
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,390
when you're being so negative.

551
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,258
Showtime.

552
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:02,160
That's what
you're worried about?

553
00:23:02,228 --> 00:23:04,329
Once you bear down to push
an enormous head

554
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:06,499
through a not-quite-big-enough
opening

555
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:08,066
that no amount
of kegel exercises

556
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:09,668
will ever whip back into shape,

557
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:11,136
you won't give a rat's ass

558
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:12,336
whether or not
you paid attention

559
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:13,671
during breathing exercises.

560
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:14,806
You're gonna be too busy
screaming for drugs

561
00:23:14,874 --> 00:23:15,974
and wishing that son of a bitch

562
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,609
who knocked you up
had never been born.

563
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:20,945
Ladies and gentlemen,
my fabulous wife.

564
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:23,615
You're all doing great. Another
five minutes of breathing,

565
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:25,082
and we can move on
to some ball work.

566
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,684
Which is what got us
here in the first place.

567
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:30,621
Good job.
Keep breathing.

568
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:33,524
Yeah, this one--
think maybe a turkey baster.

569
00:23:33,591 --> 00:23:35,959
Oh. Missionary position.
Lights off,

570
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:37,694
blinds drawn, two minutes,
and done.

571
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:42,332
What about the creepy twins?

572
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,135
Oh. Sex swing
and a ball gag for sure.

573
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,070
- Shh.
- Are you two going to ruin

574
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:50,606
this beautiful experience
for everybody?

575
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:52,642
- Honey, lighten up.
- That's it.

576
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:53,776
I think it's time
you both left.

577
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:56,311

I'd be signing up for adult ed
all over town.

584
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:11,860
Oh. You'll give yourself a hernia.

585
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:13,929
Okay.

586
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:20,868
Do you mind? I'm trying
to screw my husband.

587
00:24:20,936 --> 00:24:24,204
Man, do I love my wife.

588
00:24:24,272 --> 00:24:25,305
Oh.

589
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,794
_

590
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:35,963
So this, uh, mother
of a patient of mine

591
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,331
asked me if it was okay for her
to be having sex

592
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:39,799
this far along
in her pregnancy.

593
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,400
How far along is she?

594
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:43,535
Uh, like, you know,
second trimester-y.

595
00:24:43,604 --> 00:24:45,571
Wait. Doesn't her OB
have that covered?

596
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:47,372
I don't think she likes him,

597
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,841
and apparently, she saw
this thing on the Internet

598
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:50,743
of this woman
who experienced sex

599
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:52,377
and then went into labor early,

600
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:54,080
- and the baby wasn't fully cooked.
- Dude, it's sick.

601
00:24:54,147 --> 00:24:57,716
I hope that was her word
and not yours.

602
00:24:57,783 --> 00:25:00,418
Did she, uh, did she experience
any discomfort?

603
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:02,420
- Not that she mentioned.
- Is it a high-risk pregnancy?

604
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:03,922
It's...

605
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,824
multiples. I think
it's multiples, so...

606
00:25:05,891 --> 00:25:09,127
Oh, really? So, uh, when did
you and Charlotte have sex?

607
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:11,962
Like a week ago.

608
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,297
What are you doing
trolling the Internet

609
00:25:13,365 --> 00:25:14,865
- for medical advice anyway?
- It's not my fault.

610
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:16,867
It's Al Gore's fault
for inventing the Internet,

611
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:18,636
and all those people that
make it this horrible place

612
00:25:18,703 --> 00:25:21,739
where all my darkest fears are
so conveniently realized.

613
00:25:21,806 --> 00:25:24,008
Charlotte is fine.
If anything was gonna go wrong,

614
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:26,744
it would've happened by now.
But since you are at 22 weeks,

615
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:28,811
you know, it might be a good
idea to keep it in your pants.

616
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:31,448
Yeah. Charlotte's not the one
to worry about.

617
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:34,217
Uh, you're already at what,
stage one daddy freak-out.

618
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:36,786
- Just wait until the babies come.
- Stop it. I'm a pediatrician.

619
00:25:36,854 --> 00:25:37,987
Yeah, who's worried
that he might induce labor

620
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:39,356
with his little Cooper.

621
00:25:39,423 --> 00:25:41,724
Okay.

622
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,225
I'm around kids all day.

623
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,361
Charlotte runs the hospital.

624
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:48,964
- We're prepared.
- No, you're never fully prepared.

625
00:25:49,032 --> 00:25:51,033
Plus, you're having three.
You're gonna be outnumbered.

626
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,101
Dr. Cooper Freedman,
pediatrician.

627
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,703
No, it's different.

628
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:56,405
- How?
- It just is.

629
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:57,640
That's deep.

630
00:25:57,707 --> 00:25:59,541
Look, my advice?
Cancel the Internet.

631
00:25:59,608 --> 00:26:02,510
Okay. I make this, I'm gonna be
officially recognized

632
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:05,313
as the best,
most prepared father

633
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:08,249
in history of the world.

634
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,285
- Get it! Two out of three. Two
out of three. - All right. Try again.

635
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:12,820
Two, one. Freedman!

636
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:26,233
It's been a long time
since I've made a new friend.

637
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:29,836
You know, a real friend.

638
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:33,105
And I know by getting a consult
for Ally, I overstepped,

639
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:36,209
but, um, I think of you
as a friend,

640
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:37,376
and I wanted to help.

641
00:26:37,444 --> 00:26:39,478
I'm sorry.

642
00:26:39,546 --> 00:26:41,447
We are.

643
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:43,115
We are friends.

644
00:26:43,183 --> 00:26:45,685
But you have to understand,
two doctors told me

645
00:26:45,752 --> 00:26:48,786
the same thing that
your friend did months ago.

646
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:50,522
But I...

647
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,824
I couldn't hear it.

648
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:55,660
So I went to see a psychic--
which is insane, I know--

649
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:58,730
but she said there was hope.

650
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:00,699
I understand
wanting to hold on, I do,

651
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:03,667
but at a certain point...

652
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:05,669
Was Pete the love of your life?

653
00:27:10,408 --> 00:27:11,575
Ally is.

654
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:15,312
I was married
to a wonderful man

655
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,747
for eight and a half years.

656
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:18,349
He was my best friend.

657
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:22,818
And I didn't know that there
could be more until I met Ally.

658
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:25,020
And that kind of love?

659
00:27:25,088 --> 00:27:27,189
I can't even tell you
how she made me feel.

660
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:30,460
But I felt that way every day
for ten years.

661
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:33,329
Every single day.

662
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:35,631
And if I pull the plug,

663
00:27:35,698 --> 00:27:37,666
if-- if she's gone,

664
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:40,235
really gone,

665
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:44,172
I'm afraid that no one will
ever love me like that again.

666
00:27:46,376 --> 00:27:47,942
And who thinks like that?

667
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,246
I mean, she's the one
lying there, stuck in limbo,

668
00:27:52,314 --> 00:27:54,815
and I'm worried about me.

669
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,518
I'm a terrible person.

670
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,890
When Pete died,
I felt relieved.

671
00:28:02,957 --> 00:28:04,858
I've never told that
to anybody,

672
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:08,495
never said it out loud.

673
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:13,366
I mean, I miss him. I do. I miss
him all the time, every day.

674
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:15,868
But Pete was...

675
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:18,505
Pete.

676
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:21,874
He was complicated
and difficult,

677
00:28:21,942 --> 00:28:24,343
and I tried for so long
to work out our issues,

678
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,478
and...

679
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:29,147
I mean, the thing was,
we don't have issues anymore.

680
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:30,582
You know, he won't fight,
he won't leave,

681
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,219
because Pete is-- is...

682
00:28:34,287 --> 00:28:35,421
Pete's dead.

683
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:39,390
The argument is over.

684
00:28:42,795 --> 00:28:45,229
So yeah, yeah, he--

685
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:46,964
he was the love of my life,

686
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:48,833
and it-- and it hurts
that he's gone,

687
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,070
but I felt r-relief.

688
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:54,806
I'm...

689
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:56,440
I'm relieved.

690
00:28:58,676 --> 00:29:01,478
She is the love of my life,

691
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:04,348
and I don't feel relieved.

692
00:29:04,415 --> 00:29:07,351
I just want her back.

693
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:19,261
_

694
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,663
Isaac invited me

695
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:22,631
to his brother's Bar Mitzvah
next month.

696
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:23,899
Can I go?

697
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:24,967
Sure.

698
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:26,902
Am I gonna have one of those?

699
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,837
Do you wanna be Jewish?

700
00:29:28,904 --> 00:29:30,605
I don't know. Maybe.

701
00:29:30,673 --> 00:29:32,707
Well, that's cool if it's
something you wanna do.

702
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:34,542
You can pave the way
for the triplets.

703
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,943
We're raising them Jewish?

704
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:38,045
Uh, I know we haven't talked
about it,

705
00:29:38,113 --> 00:29:40,114
but I was thinking... maybe.

706
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:41,282
Well, you don't go to temple.

707
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,384
But those traditions are
part of who I am,

708
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:45,686
and that spiritual heritage is

709
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:47,954
- something I want for the children.
- Well, so do I,

710
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:49,857
which is why I think
they should be baptized.

711
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:52,225
If they aren't baptized,
they won't go to heaven.

712
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:54,528
Okay, I know I eat pork
and shellfish...

713
00:29:54,596 --> 00:29:56,229
and I don't feel
I need to go to Israel...

714
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:57,964
and I married a Christian,
so one could argue

715
00:29:58,032 --> 00:29:59,799
that I should be flexible...

716
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,834
when it comes
to religious instruction.

717
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:03,936
But baptism? No way.

718
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:06,406
All my ancestors would roll over
in their graves.

719
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:08,441
My mom took me to church
sometimes,

720
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:10,276
like, for Christmas,
Easter, too.

721
00:30:10,343 --> 00:30:12,311
Well, those services
are nice, right?

722
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:13,846
I want the babies to wake up
on Christmas morning

723
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:15,147
to presents under a tree.

724
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:16,882
I want to hide Easter eggs.

725
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,750
Okay, I don't think we should
base our children's religion

726
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:21,553
on what the most entertaining
holidays are.

727
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:23,855
- Why not? - Because that is
a battle I would totally lose.

728
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,924
I mean, nobody wants to fast
at Yom Kippur.

729
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,859
And you eat matzo
and you don't poop for a week.

730
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,961
Although christianity
isn't all fun and games.

731
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,779
The son of God gets nailed to
a cross and his father loved it.

732
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,498
How does that not give a kid
nightmares?

733
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:35,800
Video game day.

734
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,100
That would be so cool.

735
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,536
Or we could expose them
to both religions.

736
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,505
- Let them decide.
- Doesn't that seem confusing?

737
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:45,309
I'm not confused.
Two religions, twice the gifts.

738
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,343
Think about it, Coop.

739
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,445
We got plenty of time.

740
00:30:51,381 --> 00:30:54,283
_

741
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:56,685
It's too soon! They're only
lettuce! They won't make it!

742
00:30:56,753 --> 00:30:58,787
It's gonna be okay, Charlotte.
It'll be okay.

743
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:00,423
Dr. Montgomery's
five minutes out.

744
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,058
We'll need a BOA kit
and an OB bed.

745
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,725
And give her nifedipine,
10 milligrams.

746
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:06,095
I'm only 26 weeks!
You gotta stop the labor!

747
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:07,896
Addison's gonna take care
of everything. Don't worry.

748
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:09,932
- Is she gonna be okay?
- She's gonna be fine. Okay?

749
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,532
You remember nurse Fiona? You go
to school with her daughter.

750
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,001
Okay, Amelia's gonna come
and pick you up.

751
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:14,436
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

752
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:15,937
Labor's not supposed to be
for another six weeks,

753
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:17,905
and I was gonna bring her
ice chips and rub her back

754
00:31:17,974 --> 00:31:19,540
and all the babies
were gonna be healthy

755
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:21,476
and Charlotte was
gonna be incredibly happy

756
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:22,810
because she would've known
that I would've done

757
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:25,680
everything I could to keep her
and the baby safe.

758
00:31:25,747 --> 00:31:28,148
It wasn't supposed to
be like this.

759
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:40,958
I started the tocolytics,

760
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:43,227
- but she's still laboring. - Okay,
Charlotte, let's see what's going on here.

761
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,263
What? What is it?

762
00:31:47,331 --> 00:31:49,699
One of the triplets is
presenting as a footling breach.

763
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:51,467
- We need to deliver right now.
- The lungs ar-aren't developed.

764
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,803
We don't have a choice.
I need three resuscitation kits

765
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,405
and three incubators.

766
00:31:55,472 --> 00:31:57,939
Let the nicu know they could be
getting up to 3 26-weekers.

767
00:31:58,007 --> 00:31:59,174
Okay, Charlotte, we're gonna
start delivering now.

768
00:31:59,242 --> 00:32:01,243
- Okay? You ready? Let's go.
- Okay.

769
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,379
Good.

770
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:07,683
Good. Good. There you go.

771
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,018
Aah!

772
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:11,853
Aah.

773
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:15,256
2.5 tube and a straight blade.

774
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:17,157
- What's happening?
- Addison's working on it.

775
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,992
- Addison?
- Charlotte, I'm going to examine you

776
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,229
to see if the remaining
membranes are intact, okay?

777
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:23,264
- Okay. Okay.
- It's okay.

778
00:32:27,302 --> 00:32:30,237
Is she breathing?
Why-- why isn't she crying?

779
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:32,071
All right. Come on, kid.
Help me out here.

780
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:33,740
Okay, the membranes are intact,
and if the meds

781
00:32:33,807 --> 00:32:35,275
that Dr. Peterson gave you
worked, then--

782
00:32:35,343 --> 00:32:36,843
- What? Then what?
- The contractions will stop.

783
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,078
Until 32 weeks?

784
00:32:39,146 --> 00:32:40,480
Because these babies
aren't ready to be delivered.

785
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:42,349
- I can stitch up your cervix.
- What?

786
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:43,650
That'll delay delivery
for a few weeks,

787
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:45,284
give the other babies
a chance to mature.

788
00:32:45,352 --> 00:32:46,385
Jake, is that safe?

789
00:32:46,453 --> 00:32:47,953
There are significant risks.

790
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,322
Maternal morbidity in delayed
interval birth is about 30%.

791
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,324
Charlotte could die?

792
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:54,493
How is she?
She's got ectopia cordis.

793
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:56,729
The chest wall hasn't developed
completely to cover the heart.

794
00:32:56,796 --> 00:32:58,364
She'll need surgery.

795
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:00,266
Oh, what do we do, Cooper?

796
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,066
I just-- I don't want
to lose these babies,

797
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:04,269
but I'm scared.
What do we do?

798
00:33:04,336 --> 00:33:05,903
Okay, look at me. Look at me.
Here's what's gonna happen--

799
00:33:05,971 --> 00:33:08,239
Addison is gonna sew up
your cervix,

800
00:33:08,307 --> 00:33:09,574
and I'm gonna go be
with our daughter,

801
00:33:09,642 --> 00:33:11,376
and this plan is gonna work.
You're gonna be okay.

802
00:33:11,443 --> 00:33:14,479
You're not gonna die.
Okay?

803

Don't get me wrong.

867
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,967
Mason's the best thing
that ever happened to me,

868
00:36:33,035 --> 00:36:36,771
but his mother did all the hard
work. She got him there.

869
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:40,708
I look at my baby and I know
she might not make it,

870
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:44,212
and even if she does, I hear
Addison saying, "cognitive"

871
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:46,914
and...
"Neurological impairment."

872
00:36:46,982 --> 00:36:48,849

873
00:36:50,517 --> 00:36:55,155
Maybe I should've fought harder

874

But we're a team.

875
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,525
We are a team, and Charlotte's
lying in a hospital bed,

876
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:02,129
trying to keep
our other babies safe.

877
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:07,499
And I don't know
how to do this.

878
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:09,334
How the hell do I do this?

879
00:37:09,402 --> 00:37:12,571
I need more time.
I'm just not...

880
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,106
ready.

881
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,447
But who gets enough time?

882
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:25,316
Pete certainly didn't.

883
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:28,153
Violet didn't get enough time
with him.

884
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,454
My family needs me.

885
00:37:30,522 --> 00:37:31,656
Charlotte and Mason

886
00:37:31,723 --> 00:37:33,758
and baby King-Freedman

887
00:37:33,826 --> 00:37:37,194
and the two heads of lettuce--
they all need me,

888
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:39,997
because I'm the dad now.

889
00:37:40,064 --> 00:37:43,834
And so it's time to step up
and do my job,

890
00:37:43,902 --> 00:37:49,472
because being a dad is
the greatest gift in the world.

891
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,375
So...

892
00:37:52,443 --> 00:37:55,344
it's time.

893
00:37:55,412 --> 00:37:57,646
Hey. How's Charlotte?

894
00:37:57,714 --> 00:38:00,316
Good. Uh, she tolerated
the procedure well.

895
00:38:00,383 --> 00:38:02,218
Contractions have stopped,
and she's sleeping.

896
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:03,719
- So are we out of the woods?
- Not entirely.

897
00:38:03,787 --> 00:38:05,822
I had to put her into
trendelenburg.

898
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:08,724
It could prevent her
from going into labor again.

899
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:11,059
- And how long does she have to stay
like that? - Probably until she gives birth.

900
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:15,463
And in that position,

901
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:17,632
she's at risk for blood clots,
headaches?

902
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,534
Yeah.

903
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:21,602
She's not gonna be able
to see her baby.

904
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,072
Anyway, I'm sorry.

905
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,505
No. Thank you.

906
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:34,281
Hey, little girl.

907
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:35,582
I'm sorry you don't have
a name yet.

908
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,653
Your mom and I haven't had time
to decide.

909
00:38:39,721 --> 00:38:42,355

914
