00:00:00,777 --> 00:00:02,117
Mr. Hotate, hi.

2
00:00:02,118 --> 00:00:03,326
Thank you for coming.

3
00:00:03,327 --> 00:00:04,367
Would you like some water?

4
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:07,680
Water?
Like fire water?

5
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:09,916
That's racist,
and I do not appreciate it.

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,801
No, no, no, no, no.
I-I didn't mean it like that.

7
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,269
I just meant, you know--

8
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,304
I'm just messing
with you.

9
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:16,255
- Oh, my God!
- [Laughs]

10
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:17,590
He's funny.
This guy's funny.

11
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:18,858
- He does that sometimes.
- But seriously.

12
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,927
I'll have a whiskey.

13
00:00:20,945 --> 00:00:24,063
Ken Hotate is the leader
of the Wamapoke people,

14
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:25,398
and we are trying
to get them involved

15
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:26,900
in our Pawnee Commons project.

16
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:28,618
Ken and I
get along great.

17
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:30,703
But historically,
Pawnee's relationship

18
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:34,071
with the Wamapoke
has been more...

19
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,742
Murder-y.

20
00:00:35,776 --> 00:00:38,127
What about--and I'm just
spit-balling here--

21
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:41,197
a large neon advertisement
for the Wamapoke casino?

22
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:43,550
We have a new slogan
that I'm quite proud of:

23
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:46,417
"Our slots
are downright filthy."

24
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:48,889
I think it's a slam-dunk idea.
I think we're done here.

25
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,257
I don't--
I don't think we are.

26
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,125
I don't know if we could
put that in a public park.

27
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:54,961
In that case,
the playground will be great.

28
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:58,298
Why don't we retire
to my longhouse

29
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,516
and smoke the ceremonial
peace pipe to celebrate?

30
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,602
[Chuckles]

31
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:04,604
- Is he joking?
- I don't know.

Well, well, well.

If it isn't Mr. Best Man
and Bachelor boy.

36
00:01:29,663 --> 00:01:31,631
Ann Perkins,
Maid of Honor,

37
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:33,332
are you ready
for the bachelorette party?

38
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,434
Uh, more than ready.

39
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,803
We've got dancing,
Jell-o shots,

40
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:38,004
private karaoke,

41
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:39,806
and anything
that can be penis-shaped

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,274
will be penis-shaped.

43
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:42,475
- Ohhh!
- What?

44
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,510
As Leslie's maid of honor,

45
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:47,814
I really need her
bachelorette party to go well.

46
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:50,850
Which is why I'm stress-eating
gummy penises.

47
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:55,955
What are you losers doing
for your bachelor party?

48
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,957
I told Ben he could do
whatever he wants.

49
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,025
Sky is the limit.

50
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:02,028
We have Haverford,
Swanson, Dwyer--

51
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:03,582
Jerry forced his way
in there somehow--

52
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:05,665
things are bound
to get crazy.

53
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:09,532
The game is
Settlers of Catan.

54
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,538
The object is be the first
to build a civilization

55
00:02:12,556 --> 00:02:13,973
on this fictional island.

56
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,224
I can't believe
this is what you want to do

57
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:16,476
for your bachelor party.

58
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,270
Look, guys,
we don't have to play this game

59
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:19,262
if you don't want to.

60
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,714
I mean,
I'm nationally ranked,

61
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:23,182
so it isn't even
really fair.

62
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:25,435
Ben, this is your night.

63
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:26,719
We do what you want to do.

64
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:28,521
Come on, let's play.
[Pounds on table]

65
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,024
I'm not a big bachelor party
kind of guy,

66
00:02:31,058 --> 00:02:33,026
so when the guys asked me
what my perfect night would be,

67
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,695
I told them the truth--
beer and board games.

68
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,615
They thought I was kidding.

69
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,283
I was not kidding.

70
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,619
Is this gonna be one of
those cool bachelorette parties

71
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,371
where things get out of control
and we murder someone,

72
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:46,706
and then we all have to take
a blood oath

73
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,174
to never reveal our secret?

74
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,126
No.

75
00:02:50,177 --> 00:02:53,046
Then I might have
to leave early.

76
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,413
What the hell?

77
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,667
Well, well, well.

78
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,552
Don't you ladies look nice...
For once?

79
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:01,504
Just kidding.
I've actually always been

80
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:03,006
attracted to this one.

81
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,440
Jamm, what the hell
are you doing?

82
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:05,508
We're laying
the groundwork

83
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:06,559
for Pawnee's
newest restaurant.

84
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,311
"Future home
of Paunch Burger.

85
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:10,012
Start drooling, fatties"?

86
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,481
Look, the deal was
that both of us

87
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:13,032
had three months to get
our proposals together,

88
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,451
and then we put it
up for a vote.

89
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,953
- We still have two weeks left.
- Yeah, that's true.

90
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:19,622
However, here's the problem.

91
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,990
Turns out, I don't care.

92
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:22,242
You can't stop this train.

93
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:23,526
Make all the ruckus
you want.

94
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:25,194
By the time
this all gets cleared up,

95
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:27,163
the people will be frothing
at the mouth

96
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:28,164
for that beef.

real good.

Yes, they do, sir.

open invitation.

Oh, I'm sorry,
what's this?

00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:48,298
Seven contiguous segments,
giving me longest road

106
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:51,237
and a sweet-ass ten points
for the win.

Hey, you want
to stick around?

118
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,491
I got a bunch
of <i>Homeland</i> episodes

peter out like this.

no strippers

- If you guys spot me.

133
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:36,515
It sounds expensive.

00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:37,817
Just so you know,

135
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,318
it's not your typical bar.

136
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:41,687
They specialize
in molecular mixology.

137
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:44,023

please.

What's happening?

151
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:20,276
Oh, this is
a sort of play on Scotch.

152
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:22,445
It's a whiskey-infused lotion.

153
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:24,396
Can I ask
if this entire establishment

154
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:26,532
is a practical joke
of some kind?

155
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:28,034
If you don't like the Scotch,
they have a vodka

156
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:31,070
that's served in the form
of a flash of light.

157
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,457
Hey.

158
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:35,708

down the drain,

on my head.

right out from under us.

why I prefer nightmares.

You are sad drinking
right now,

and I need you
to be happy drinking.

166

Like when we watch

167
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,592
I know, Ann, but everything's
gonna disappear.

Just try to forget
about it.

I mean, there's nothing
you can do to stop them tonight.

174

For almost 200 years,

369
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:17,516
Now we're going
to a steakhouse.

What are you doing?

Jerry, are you sure
this is our table?

385
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:48,140
There's only four settings.

Excuse me, sir.
This is not your table.

387
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,477
Well, I thought you said
the Gergich party.

388

But you know what?
Gingrich, Gergich.

392
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,937
I wonder if we're related.

393
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:03,189
I don't think so, Jerry.

That's not something
you really need to specify.

There are so many things
that I could say about Ron,

412

but I think
that the best man's speech

413
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:39,191
should represent the groom.

414
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:41,360
So I will just say...

415
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:42,361
To Ron.

Yes, please.
Take extra cream, 30 sugars.

I can't believe I tried
to exploit the Wamapoke

436
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:17,897
for my own personal gain.

437
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:19,398
Well, we got
most of the artifacts,

438
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:20,966
and even if we didn't,
they probably won't find them.

439
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,735
Yeah, and if they do,

in your toilet

- we ended up having.
- Whoa.

we should do for him?

What?

498
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,687
In 1921,
several Wamapoke families

499
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,055
were removed
from their homes

500
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,724
so that Pawnee could install
a bumper car track.

501
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:23,777
In 1951,
Pawnee made it illegal

502
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:25,279
for people to,

503
00:16:25,313 --> 00:16:27,865
"Dance or smell
like a native American."

504
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,432
Why are you telling me
all this?

505
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,552
Well, I want to raise the bar
of awfulness

506
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:32,953
so that when I confess
something to you,

507
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:35,155
you have perspective.

508
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:37,291
Those artifacts found
at lot 48

509
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:38,659
were placed there
by me.

510
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,961
I wanted to delay construction
on the Paunch Burger

511
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:44,080
and buy some more time
for my park project.

512
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:46,750

That is not great.

513
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:47,834
It sucks.

514
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,285
I'm very, very sorry.

515
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:51,721
I have great respect
for the Wamapoke culture.

516
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:53,673
And this isn't even
about the Pawnee Commons.

517
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:56,393
I just hope that you
can forgive me, Ken.

Now,
you've never been married,

525

your own bachelor party.

00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:12,109
But let's look ahead.

527
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,277
The year is 2018.

528
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:17,164
America is thriving
under president Nick Cannon,

529
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:20,066
and tomorrow,
Chris Traeger's getting married.

530
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:21,535
Who's the lucky lady?

531
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:24,504
Maybe she's an upbeat gal
who's nuts about fitness.

532
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,957
Maybe she owns
a juice bar in Snerling.

533
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:29,459
Maybe it's April.
Maybe I die.

534
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,545
Skydiving explosion.
Pbbbt.

535
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:32,963
And then you go marry April.

536
00:17:33,014 --> 00:17:34,347
And it makes me sad,

537
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:36,383
but if she's gonna be
with somebody,

538
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,584
I'd like it to be you.

539
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:39,302
Strange, but sweet.

540
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:41,388
Only I didn't really die.
I was faking it.

541
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:43,273
And I come back.

542
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:46,309
I spy on you
from my red Corvette.

543
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,527
And I'm planning
to kick your ass,

544
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:49,429
but I see how happy
you make her,

545
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:50,564
and I have to walk away.

546
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:52,649
I have to.
And I do, slowly.

547
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,900
In a rainstorm.

548
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:54,985
Okay, this isn't really
in the spirit

549
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:56,153
of what we're trying to do.

550
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:58,989
But as time goes by,
it eats away at me.

551
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,574
You're out living it up
with my wife.

552
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,375
And I'm alone.

553
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,744
In a cave.

554
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:06,613
Training.

555
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,448
Anyone else
want to chime in?

556
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:09,782
I thought
you were my friend.

557
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,168
I thought you were my friend!

558
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:12,952
Okay, what we're trying
to say is

559
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,221
that you are a great guy,

560
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:16,590
and someday,
you're gonna meet somebody

561
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:19,125
who's into all the same stuff
that you are.

562
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:21,511
You know, the old Chris
would've loved

563
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:24,648
this super-fit
health goddess

564
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:25,765
you guys
are talking about.

565
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,185
But our great adventure
reminded me

566
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:30,187
that now I just want someone
that values

567
00:18:30,238 --> 00:18:31,404
the important things
in life--

568
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,940
friendships, passion,
happiness.

569
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:36,243
And dimples
are a plus.

570
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:37,861
- [Chuckles]
- Aw, that's sweet.

571
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:40,530
I forgive you, bro.
You take care of April.

572
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:42,582
After careful examination,

573
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:45,418
we have determined that
these Wamapoke artifacts

574
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:47,754
could not have originated
in lot 48.

575
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:49,539
Boom.
Knew it.

576
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,591
There's something else.

577
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:53,126
I would like to go
on record and say that--

578
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,211
Hold on, Ms. Knope.

579
00:18:54,262 --> 00:18:56,162
Please.

580
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,597
I would like to go
on record.

581
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:59,332
Speaking as a citizen
of Pawnee,

582
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,101
I do not like the way
you went back on your deal

583
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:02,936
with Councilwoman Knope.

584
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,222
It reminds me of what
the settlers of Pawnee did

585
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:06,339
to my ancestors,

586
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:09,690
taking their land
without permission.

587
00:19:10,444 --> 00:19:12,312
He really plays white people
like a fiddle.

588
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:13,030
[Chuckles]

589
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:14,030
Wow.

590
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:15,398
It's amazing to watch.

591
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:16,783
You and Leslie
had a deal.

592
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:18,902
If that deal
is not restored,

593
00:19:18,953 --> 00:19:22,286
well, I believe
there are six Paunch Burgers

594
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:23,623
in the Wamapoke casino.

595
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:26,409
Perhaps it's time
that we revisited

596
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,410
those contracts.

597
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:30,297
Is that a threat?

598
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:33,664
Why, yes, I--
I thought that was obvious.

599
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:35,719
Take the sign down.

600
00:19:35,753 --> 00:19:37,304
We'll wait
until everything's official.

601
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:38,922
In the spirit
of fair play,

602
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:42,306
I suggest we put on these
authentic Wamapoke headdresses

603
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,144
and dance
around the table.

604
00:19:44,178 --> 00:19:45,745
Absolutely not.

605
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:47,881
That sounds
highly offensive.

606
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:49,516
Does it, white man?

607
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,085
No.
It's not offensive.

608
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:55,138
- So let's do it.
- You first.

609
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:57,857
So clearly,
this is not offensive.

610
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,059
It is offensive.

611
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:01,645
- I am very sorry.
- Take it off.

612
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:03,396
Hey, Wyatt.

613
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,864
Oh, hey, Shauna.

614
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:05,865
So I was chasing
this story,

615
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,200
but it seems like
a dead end.

616
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:10,487
Then I heard about your crazy
rotating bachelor party.

617
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:11,738
Would you mind
if I wrote about it?

618
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:13,290
Sure.

619
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:14,991
But is that really news?

620
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:16,076
To me it is.

621
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,711
A group of good friends
having fun,

622
00:20:17,745 --> 00:20:18,912
doing nice things
for each other.

623
00:20:18,946 --> 00:20:20,664
I mean, that's what's important
in life,

624
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:22,549
and I want to write
about it.

625
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,950
Hey, Chris.

626
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:24,968
Ben Wyatt.

627
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:26,836
And Shauna Malwae-Tweep.

628
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:28,121
Hey,
Shauna's doing a story

629
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,839
on our group bachelor party.

630
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,124
She said she wanted
to write stories

631
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:33,843
about good people doing
nice things for each other.

632
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:36,763
So I figured you two might have
a lot to talk about.

633
00:20:36,797 --> 00:20:39,049
You may be right
about that.

634
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,568
Do you have a second
right now?

635
00:20:41,602 --> 00:20:43,103
I have thousands
of seconds.

636
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:44,571
Would you like
to have lunch?

637
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:46,106
Are you a vegetarian?

638
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,274
A vegan?
A pescatarian?

639
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:49,409
Not that it matters.

640
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:52,162
- Um, I like burgers.
- Perfect.

641
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:54,789
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh!

642
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:58,074
Three, ten, bullock!
Three, ten, bullock!

643
00:20:58,342 --> 00:20:59,927
Give it to me.

644
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:02,082
How great a day was today?

645
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:03,963
[Panting]
Oh, God, I could die.

646
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,331
Greatest day of my life.

647
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:06,633
I met Andrew Luck today.

648
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:07,801
I met Reggie Wayne today.

649
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:09,168
And I met Jim Irsay.

650
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,055
I'm standing
on the field.

651
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:13,172
Lucas Oil Stadium.

652
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,725
And I'm playing football
with my friends.

653
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,225
ALL: Cheering.

654
