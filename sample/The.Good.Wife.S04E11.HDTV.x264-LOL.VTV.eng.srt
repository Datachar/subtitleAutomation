belong to one of your
foreclosed properties?

4

MAN: It belongs to one of the properties

5
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:23,996
where the householder
could not repay his loan.

6
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:26,415
And therefore, we exercised our prerogative

7
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:29,001
as the bank holding the lease to foreclose.

10

- We need 60 million by February.

And yet, one of our creditors

29
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:05,737

Very simply, sir, you
foreclosed on these...

41
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:32,314
- The homeowners neglected to pay.
- You left these homes

abandoned, you left these pools...

43
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,101
- We did nothing. These pools?
- No, sir.

44
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:37,236
After you kicked the homeowners out,

45
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:38,520
you did nothing with the swimming pools.

46
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:39,655
You let the water stagnate.

47
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:41,523
- The water was stagnant already.
- And that water

48
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:43,609
drew mosquitoes. These
mosquitoes, to be exact.

49
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:46,061
And those mosquitoes carried
West Nile virus to my client,

50
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:47,779

Now, sir, if we could turn
to these foreclosed homes

00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:42,963
and their swimming pools...

133
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:46,016
- Yes. Um, could I say something first?
- Certainly, sir.

134
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:47,935
I understand there are a lot of homeowners

135
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,303
who are underwater.

136
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:52,723
I understand many homebuyers
were enticed into taking on

137
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,359
adjustable mortgages that
eventually bankrupt them.

138
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,678
But what I often think is that banks

139
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,863
are made the bad guys in these equations,

140
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,514
and that is unwarranted.

141
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:03,650
- Thank you, sir.
- But what I wholly condemn

142
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:06,153
are any efforts to advance political causes

143
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:07,404
through legal means.

144
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:08,705
I mean, for example,

145
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:10,457
uh, communities using eminent domain

146
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,075
to address bank foreclosures.

147
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:16,797
Or here, using this painful
circumstance of a young child

148
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:20,100
with West Nile virus to force us to
change our methods on foreclosures.

149
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:23,437
I think you've been
misinformed, Mr. Ingersol.

150
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,506
Kaley Spence is suing you for $15 million.

151
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:27,724
13 million.

152
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:30,427
She's suing you because she had a
promising career as a ballet dancer,

153
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,930
and now she needs full-time care.

154
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,932
- We don't need the photos.
- I think we do.

155

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
The judge was explicit in her ruling.

178
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:15,105
If we made the effort
to be near your ranch,

179
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,189
you must sit down with us

180
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:17,524
- for at least three hours.
- And I will.

181
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,943
- But, a in, this is an emergency.
- No, sir!

182
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:22,145
I'll be back this afternoon at 2:00.

183
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:23,363
Please be patient.

184
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:24,564
You will get your time.

185
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:25,932
I promise you.

186
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:29,987
Well, that is unfortunate.

187
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,605
<i>FRANK: No, I think you're doing well.</i>

188
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:34,041
We expected a bump in Maddie's polling.

189
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:35,626
She's the fresh new thing.

190
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,793
Yes, we expected that, too.

191
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:39,212
We're still beating her 47 to 42.5.

192
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:40,447
That's outside the margin of error.

193
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,499
I know. We're not worried.

194
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:45,052
And yet you're here.

195
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:47,421
It's a visit.

196
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:48,639
The Democratic Committee

197
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,557
has a lot invested in your boy Florrick.

198
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:52,342
We want to make sure he wins.

199
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,677
And you're worried he won't?

200
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,929
I'm worried the sun
won't rise tomorrow, Eli.

201
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:57,314
It's a visit. That's all.

202
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,965
Thank you.

203
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,851
Come again sometime.

204
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,837
I heard something.

205
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,741
Something that worried me.

206
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,743
I heard your offices were raided.

207
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,078
It's nothing, Frank.

208
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,162
It's not nothing.

209
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:14,748
<i>No raid is nothing. A raid is something.</i>

210
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,866
- It's not about the candidate.
- I know it's not

211
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,617
about the candidate. It's about you.

212
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,005
(closing door): I'm not
hiding anything from you.

213
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:25,592
There are forces within
the Justice Department

214
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:27,594
that do not want Peter
to win the governorship.

215
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:29,680
Now, they don't have the
facts to come after him,

216
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,182
so they're coming after me
as a steppingstone to Peter.

217
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:34,851
- And they have the facts to come after you?
- N... no.

218
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:37,504
I'm just saying, they know

219
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:39,672
that Peter without me would be limping.

220
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:41,475
So, they want this.

221
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:44,728
They want you coming to me suggesting...

222
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,814
What are you suggesting?

223
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:50,617
Not that you resign.

224
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:51,902
You're not an issue yet.

225
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,453
But you need a strong second

226
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:55,238
in case you do become an issue.

227
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,624
- I know you don't like it, Eli.
- (laughs quietly)

228
00:07:57,626 --> 00:07:59,209
But you need a second.

229
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,495
♪

230
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,490
So, 2:00 p.m., huh?

231
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,892
Yes. I'm not sure what happened.

232
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:17,811
The judge won't be happy.

233
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:19,846
Mr. Ingersol is a very...

234
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:22,682
If I hear one more time
how busy Mr. Ingersol is,

235
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:24,050
I will strangle you.

236
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:26,236
(phone rings)

237
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,488
Hello?

238
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,491
Yeah, yeah. I understand.

239
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:34,244
No, uh, she's here. I'll tell her.

240
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:35,996
Okay, thank you. Bye.

241
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:37,781
Mr. Ingersol would like to apologize...

242
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,283
- Let's get the judge on the line.
- It's an emergency.

243
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,536
He said he just has to
delay until tomorrow morning.

244
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:43,954
He set aside three hours starting at 10:00.

245
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,589
He won't count today's
ten minutes against it.

246
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,591
He wanted me to apologize
to you personally.

247
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,260
He said he really enjoyed his
time with you this morning.

248
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:54,431
Let the record reflect that Mr.
Ingersol has refused to attend...

249
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,299
- He didn't refuse to attend.
- ... failed to appear

250
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:59,803
in a court-mandated deposition,
despite promising to attend

251
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,773
between the hours of
2:00 and 5:00 p.m. today.

252
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,591
Alicia, you might want
to look at this tonight.

253
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:06,059
The CDC has revised their report.

254
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:08,262
It seems there's another
possible cause for the outbreak

255
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:10,430
of West Nile virus besides
just our swimming pools.

256
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:12,449
<i>WILL: A koi pond?!</i>

257
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,934
<i>ALICIA: Yes, from a house
that wasn't foreclosed.</i>

258
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:15,902
Damn it.

259
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:17,287
The CDC report isn't saying

260
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:19,606
it's definitely from the koi pond

261
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:21,158
or from the swimming pools.

262
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,660
But the koi pond also had stagnant water.

263
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:25,045
The bank just got its wiggle room.

264
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:26,496
- Yup.
- Okay, Alicia,

265
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:27,780
we'll handle this on our end.

266
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:29,633
You just get the bank president on record

267
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,917
about the neighbors' letter.

268
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,302
When is he supposed to arrive?

269
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:33,887
10:00 a.m. tomorrow, but I
think I'm getting the runaround.

270
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:36,056
Yeah. They'll probably
wait until you're out get

271
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:37,674
breakfast or something,
then they'll tell the judge

272
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:39,509
the witness was available,
but they couldn't find you.

273
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:42,312
Mm. Unfortunately, you'll
have to outwait them.

274
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:44,681
Stay close to your room so
they can't say you were out.

275
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:47,684
Oh. Yeah, okay. But I was only
planning to stay for one night.

276
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:51,271
We'll get clothes and
incidentals out to you.

277
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,644
Mr. Hayden.

278
00:09:57,646 --> 00:10:00,447
Hello. I've been trying
to get to you all day.

279
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:01,781
Yes. I've been in meetings

280
00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:03,250
Do you have a minute?

281
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,485
No, actually, I don't.

282
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:14,160
Have you, uh, received
a notice of mediation?

283
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:15,795
No.

284
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:17,631
But you...

285
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,850
Mr. Hayden, is... is there
something I should know?

286
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,000
(elevator bell dings)

287
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:23,436
(door opens, Clarke sighs)

288
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:27,006
I requested the mediation.

289
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:28,191
You?

290
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:29,943
Why?

291
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:32,612
You need to be removed from your positions.

292
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:34,898
The firm can't be merged
with you in control.

293
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,983
Mr. Hayden, this is...

294
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:37,984
we've been nothing but cordial.

295
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:39,703
This is not about cordial.

296
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,538
I had a firm ready to merge,

297
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,657
to pay off your creditors,
and you sabotaged it.

298
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:46,192
- It was a bad deal. They wanted to break us up.
- Yes, they did.

299
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:47,410
That's exactly the point, Ms. Lockhart.

300
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:49,246
You have creditors, you owe them money.

301
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,215
They are not interested
in your self-fulfillment.

302
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:53,800
<i>They are interested in their money.</i>

303
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:55,418
Then let us make them their money.

304
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,004
Well, you'll have a chance
to argue that in mediation.

305
00:10:58,006 --> 00:11:00,056
(elevator bell dings, buzzing)

306
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:02,175
If we merge the firm,
the creditors will receive

307
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:04,928
70 cents on the dollar right now.

308
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,847
Or they can trust that you
will bring this firm back.

309
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:11,518
Either way, I'll see you in mediation.

310
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,519
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

311
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,671
Oh! Oh!

312
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:42,439
- No, no, take it.
- No, no.

313
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:44,858
- I'm fine.
- You. I probably have more in my room.

314
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,193
Are you sure? I can split it with you.

315
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:48,445
No, that'd be messy.

316
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:51,231
Thanks. I think the next
store is 50 miles away.

317
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:53,067
- Are you here for the air show?
- No.

318
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:56,036
- There's an air show?
- Yeah, I think so.

319
00:11:56,038 --> 00:11:58,289
The hotel clerk kept
talking about it. It was...

320
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,240
Oh. Excuse me. I have to run.

321
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:05,546
Mr. Canning! Hi. I'm
here. I'm here. What's up?

322
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:08,666
Oh, yeah, Alicia, I was... I was
just about to leave you a note.

323
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:10,918
Mr. Ingersol can come
in earlier this morning.

324
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,753
Right now, as a matter of fact.

325
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:14,371
Uh, we thought we'd missed you.

326
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:16,974
I'm ready. I will meet
you at the business center.

327
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:19,343
Right.

328
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:22,546
(clock ticking)

329
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:24,481
Must have been delayed.

330
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:26,650
That seems to happen a lot.

331
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:32,389
I have a friend who... who's dying.

332
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:35,659
Wants me to give the
eulogy at... at his funeral.

333
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:38,062
He just e-mailed me.

334
00:12:38,064 --> 00:12:40,080
He's dying, and he sent you an e-mail?

335
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:41,749
His wife did.

336
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:44,752
I hate that people my
age are starting to die.

337
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:47,421
It's really horrible.

338
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:48,789
It is.

339
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,624
He was my roommate in college.

340
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:52,242
Ian Keyes.

341
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:54,678
Smartest guy I ever met.

342
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,182
Ever give a eulogy?

343
00:13:00,035 --> 00:13:02,236
Yes.

344
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:05,305
To someone close?

345
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:08,058
Yes.

346
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,760
Who?

347
00:13:10,996 --> 00:13:13,497
My father.

348
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:16,600
I'm sorry.

349
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:18,602
How old was he when he died?

350
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:20,587
60.

351
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:22,289
That's young.

352
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,341
It is.

353
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:26,326
(clock ticking)

354
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:27,711
Am I upsetting you?

355
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:30,748
No. Um, why don't you call Mr. Ingersol,

356
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,833
and see what time he's gonna be here?

357
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:34,551
I'm not playing you, Alicia. He's coming.

358
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:36,387
I know.

359
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:39,423
Yeah. We're here.

360
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,092
No?

361
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:43,343
Okay, wh... when?

362
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:45,396
All right, well, just keep me in touch.

363
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:47,815
2:00 this afternoon.

364
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:54,405
Let the record reflect that Mr.
Ingersol has refused to appear

365
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:57,658
at a court-mandated deposition...

366
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,643
again.

367
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:01,812
DIANE: You sure you want to do this?

368
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:02,979
What's the downside?

369
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:04,248
You're a low priority.

370
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,950
Provoking them with a harassment suit

371
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,169
could make you a high priority.

372
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:11,839
I don't think I have any option.

373
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:14,158
WENDY: I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

374
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,343
I'm brand-new on this case,
and there was a disagreement

375
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:19,530
about who should take this meeting.

376
00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:21,098
Ms. Lockhart, Mr. Gold,
good to see you again.

377
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,266
Oh, come on!

378
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:23,684
This is a conflict of interest.

379
00:14:23,686 --> 00:14:24,802
What's that, Mr. Gold?

380
00:14:24,804 --> 00:14:26,386
You ran against my boss. You lost.

381
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:28,388
- I beat you.
- Yes, that's true.

382
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,190
Two years ago.

383
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:32,008
You asked for a proffer

384
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,177
against Mr. Florrick. That
is a conflict of interest.

385
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,395
No, that was my investigator,

386
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:37,648
Mr. LaGuardia. I have
since rescinded that offer.

387
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,801
Discounts for donations is
a serious business, Mr. Gold.

388
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:43,036
The DOJ takes it very seriously.

389
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:45,038
God. No one disappears.

390
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,857
They all come back, like zombies.

391
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:49,293
Eli. This is a complaint, Ms. Scott-Carr,

392
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:51,361
against the DOJ and your department.

393
00:14:51,363 --> 00:14:53,464
We are charging you with harassment.

394
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,399
- Please read it.
- I will.

395
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:57,217
And I'll have my secretary contact you

396
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:58,502
about a time to interview.

397
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:01,505
ELI: You want to beat Peter,
do it at the ballot box.

398
00:15:01,507 --> 00:15:03,373
Don't use this petty ploy.

399
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,892
This is not about beating Peter.

400
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:06,376
So you're angry at me now?

401
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:07,561
(laughs)

402
00:15:07,563 --> 00:15:08,762
Do I look angry?

403
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:10,264
My directive here is simple:

404
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:12,266
clean up political corruption.

405
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,685
That's all.

406
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,687
You underestimate me

407
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:18,956
if you think I'm working from bias.

408
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,990
I'll be in touch.

409
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:20,991
And you'll read our complaint?

410
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:22,993
Oh, yes. I have it right here.

411
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:25,496
Sorry, I have to get to my next meeting.

412
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:27,397
ALICIA: Hello?

413
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,665
Oh, hi.

414
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,335
I just saw you had to run off, so, I...

415
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:32,753
Oh, my gosh.

416
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:34,288
You didn't have to do that.

417
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,789
I know. It was nothing.

418
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,708
Well, thank you.

419
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,376
Uh... what do I owe you?

420
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,428
- No, no, no, nothing.
- Well, I have to pay you something.

421
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,931
No, you don't. No. Next time. I'm Simone.

422
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,299
Oh, um, Alicia.

423
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:48,018
- There aren't many people around here.
- Yes, I know.

424
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,604
It's so strange that they
built this big hotel up here.

425
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:52,940
So, are you here for vacation or something?

426
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:55,025
- Oh, no. Work. You?
- Uh.

427
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:56,560
Oh, my husband's here for work.

428
00:15:57,612 --> 00:16:01,198
You are probably the lawyer
that he's here to meet.

429
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,649
Are you Mrs. Canning?

430
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:03,867
Yes. Are you Mrs. Florrick?

431
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:06,870
- Yes.
- My husband speaks so highly of you.

432
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:08,789
- He does?
- Yes.

433
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,574
He does. He thinks you're fantastic.

434
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:14,044
For a while there, I
thought I should be jealous.

435
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:15,629
(laughs) I'm joking.

436
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:17,113
But we should have breakfast sometime.

437
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:19,716
You know, if we're going
to be here for a while.

438
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:22,502
Are we going to be here for a while?

439
00:16:22,504 --> 00:16:24,671
I don't know. You tell me.

440
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,840
(laughs) (laughs)

441
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:28,725
Well, it was really nice to meet you.

442
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:30,227
So, I'll call you for breakfast?

443
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:32,128
- Good. Yeah.
- Okay.

444
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:35,966
Simone?

445
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:37,351
Yes?

446
00:16:37,353 --> 00:16:41,488
I was so sorry to hear
about your husband's friend.

447
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,774
The one who's dying?

448
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:45,442
Who's that?

449
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:49,529
Oh, never mind. It was my mistake.

450
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:51,782
It was lovely to meet you, Simone.

451
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:54,150
You, as well, Alicia.

452
00:16:57,038 --> 00:16:59,206
Good job, Kalinda. He's sure?

453
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,992
Yeah. Look, as far as I can tell,

454
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:04,661
the Aedus... Eedus... ? Aed... ?

455
00:17:04,663 --> 00:17:06,763
Aedes albopictus.

456
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:08,465
The...

457
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:11,468
this kind of mosquito breed
doesn't transmit West Nile,

458
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,887
so it couldn't have come from the koi pond.

459
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:17,641
That virus is transmitted by the ae-aed...

460
00:17:17,643 --> 00:17:20,394
- The other one?
- Aedes aegypti.

461
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:22,646
Aedes aegypti.

462
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:24,865
By a different type of mosquito.

463
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,233
Excellent. Very good.

464
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:28,068
Just get him on the record.

465
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,820
Ah, that'll be fun.

466
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,824
We'll call you back, Kalinda.

467
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,960
What's going on out there?

468
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:40,664
He's getting Cary in line
to testify against us.

469
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,300
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

470
00:17:43,302 --> 00:17:45,368
I think we are. Yeah.

471
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,554
Good. Thank you, Cary.

472
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:53,477
Cary?

473
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,228
Yes?

474
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,047
What was Clarke discussing with you?

475
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:58,381
Uh, nothing. He just wanted to know

476
00:17:58,383 --> 00:17:59,816
about the clients who left last week.

477
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:01,051
And what did you say?

478
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:02,235
I said nothing.

479
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:04,104
I just listened. We're just a little

480
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:07,074
worried he's trying to line
up a case against us, Cary.

481
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:09,443
And that he might use you.

482
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:10,727
Do you think that's a possibility?

483
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:13,330
He didn't say anything about that.

484
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,901
Can we, um, talk to you, Cary,

485
00:18:17,903 --> 00:18:20,704
about possibly testifying for us?

486
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:22,055
(crows cawing)

487
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:25,459
2:30. And here we are again.

488
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:28,211
Why don't you go for a walk?
I'll get you when he comes.

489
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:30,380
(laughs)

490
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:34,301
How's your friend who's dying?

491
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,203
Have you heard any more from him?

492
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:38,438
No. Why?

493
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,692
Maybe you should call him.

494
00:18:41,694 --> 00:18:44,661
Maybe he's dead.

495
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:47,447
Excuse me?

496
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:49,449
Oh, I'm sorry.

497
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:51,201
Am I being insensitive?

498
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:53,203
How's the eulogy coming? I mean,

499
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:55,405
maybe you could ask
Simone to help you on that.

500
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:57,657
You met my wife.

501
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:59,242
Yes, I did.

502
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:00,961
She's wonderful.

503
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:04,047
Yes, she's... my better half.

504
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:05,415
<i>She's your only half.</i>

505
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:09,252
Funny, she'd never heard
of Ian Keyes, your roommate.

506
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:11,421
Yeah, well...

507
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:13,473
I don't share everything with her.

508
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:14,891
Your lies, for example.

509
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:16,176
You don't share your lies?

510
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:17,894
No.

511
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:19,730
Those I save for you.

512
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:21,098
(laughs)

513
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,733
What was even the point

514
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:25,402
of lying about a dying friend?

515
00:19:25,404 --> 00:19:27,303
I don't know. It was a way of connecting.

516
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:29,022
Didn't you feel we were connected?

517
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:33,026
How does a bastard like you end
up with such a wonderful wife?

518
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:34,428
Women like bastards.

519
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,146
Didn't you notice that?
It's like a challenge.

520
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:37,464
Beauty and the Beast.

521
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:40,333
It fits in with all the fairy
tales you grew up consuming.

522
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:41,535
(laughing): Oh, my God.

523
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:43,153
(phone ringing) Oh, there's Godot.

524
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:46,173
Hello.

525
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:49,492
All right. Really?

526
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:52,796
Let the record show that
Mr. Ingersol has refused

527
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,550
to attend a court-mandated
deposition for the fourth time.

528
00:19:56,552 --> 00:19:57,968
He was literally

529
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,853
- a minute away when he had another call.
- Oh, really?

530
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:01,104
Just a minute away? Wow.

531
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:03,607
He says he can reschedule
for tomorrow at 10:00.

532
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:06,393
Okay, sure. Um, it'll just...

533
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:09,563
it'll give you some time to read this.

534
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:13,533
It's saying that the CDC is
updating their report again.

535
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:15,068
The mosquito carrying

536
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,704
the West Nile virus could not
have come from the koi pond.

537
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:19,022
That's the wrong kind of mosquito.

538
00:20:19,024 --> 00:20:21,958
The right kind of mosquito could only

539
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,743
have come from the swimming pools.

540
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:27,831
So, nice try, Mr. Canning, but you lost.

541
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,133
And every day that this
deposition is delayed,

542
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:32,335
the judge is getting angrier, so...

543
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:33,553
(clicks tongue)

544
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:35,255
might want to rethink your strategy.

545
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:40,143
(dialing touch tones)

546
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:42,762
Yeah, it's me.

547
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:45,098
Yeah, I need you to look into something.

548
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:48,819
So, Kaley, hi.

549
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:49,803
Hi.

550
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:51,221
I just want to ask you a few questions,

551
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:53,657
and I know they might
seem odd to you, but please

552
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:57,727
bear with me. Have you
ever heard of Aedes aegypti?

553
00:20:57,729 --> 00:20:59,562
No.

554
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:01,414
Well, I can understand why.

555
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:05,118
That's a very long word
for a very small mosquito.

556
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,570
You don't have to patronize
her. She's not eight years old.

557
00:21:07,572 --> 00:21:09,840
Thank you, Mr. Agos.

558
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:12,843
This is an Aedes aegypti, Kaley.

559
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:14,127
This is the breed of mosquito

560
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:16,096
that carries the West Nile virus.

561
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:18,165
We didn't know that until
your attorneys pointed it out,

562
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:19,299
so thank you, Mr. Gardner,

563
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:21,034
Mr. Agos. What do you have?

564
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:25,522
Now here are diagrams of the
five abandoned swimming pools

565
00:21:25,524 --> 00:21:26,990
that bred the mosquitoes.

566
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:28,925
WILL: Seems you've
dropped the "supposedly".

567
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:30,727
Are we in agreement, the
pools bred these mosquitoes?

568
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:32,529
- Yes, we are.
- Hallelujah.

569
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:35,315
Now, here are five diagrams of the five

570
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:38,335
backyards, and do you see here?

571
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:40,820
Here are the distances between the pools

572
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:42,105
and the perimeter fences.

573
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:43,657
30 yards, 40 yards. And so on. 

574
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:44,591
Do you see?

575
00:21:44,593 --> 00:21:45,742
Yes.

576
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:47,277
The thing about Aedes aegypti:

577
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,197
they are peridomestic mosquitoes.

578
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:52,082
That means they exhibit short flight ranges

579
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:53,667
of less than 50 feet.

580
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:55,919
That means there is no way
they could have flown beyond

581
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:57,387
their respective yards.

582
00:21:57,389 --> 00:21:58,188
Are you testifying here, Martha?

583
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,673
All preamble.

584
00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:01,124
Here's my question.

585
00:22:01,126 --> 00:22:03,476
Kaley, did you climb the fence

586
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:05,729
into one of these abandoned yards?

587
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,967
Sorry to ask you again, Kaley,

588
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:12,619
but you must tell the truth here.

589
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:14,654
Did you climb the fence into one or more

590
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:17,140
of the yards of these abandoned houses?

591
00:22:17,142 --> 00:22:18,408
(sniffles)

592
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,410
One.

593
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:21,995
With my friends.

594
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:24,531
Then, I'm sorry, but the plaintiff

595
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:25,865
trespassed onto our property,

596
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:29,619
and we cannot be held
liable for that trespass.

597
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:31,487
This suit is over.

598
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:44,156
My name is Serafina Norvey,
and before we get started,

599
00:22:44,158 --> 00:22:46,325
I'd like to set the ground
rules for this mediation.

600
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:49,995
Granted, we're in your offices,
and outside those doors,

601
00:22:49,997 --> 00:22:53,332
you may all be bosses, but
in here, I am the empress.

602
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:55,734
Now, I understand,

603
00:22:55,736 --> 00:22:56,969
as the court-appointed trustee,

604
00:22:56,971 --> 00:22:58,103
you'd like to have

605
00:22:58,105 --> 00:22:59,838
the two principals removed
as managing partners?

606
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,839
CLARKE: Yes.

607
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:02,474
They blocked a merger of the firm

608
00:23:02,476 --> 00:23:03,959
that I'd arranged with Burl Preston.

609
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:06,679
That merger would have met
all the financial obligations

610
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:08,681
- of the bankruptcy.
- Is that true?

611
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:12,851
A merger was never part of
the original arrangement.

612
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:14,903
Mr. Hayden overstepped his authority

613
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:16,522
when he tried to arrange that deal

614
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:18,857
before the full term of
the five-month deadline.

615
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:21,744
My job was to satisfy the
terms set down by the court.

616
00:23:21,746 --> 00:23:23,412
Actually, it was against
the terms of the court,

617
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:26,749
in that it did not honor
the original timeframe.

618
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:28,617
Also, it worked to undermine our progress.

619
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:29,852
What progress?

620
00:23:29,854 --> 00:23:32,821
We've managed to raise
a great deal of money

621
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:34,173
in a short amount of time.

622
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:35,374
How much?

623
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:36,375
Excuse me?

624
00:23:36,377 --> 00:23:37,376
How much money?

625
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:38,310
$20 million.

626
00:23:38,312 --> 00:23:40,679
Which is 40 million
short of what they need.

627
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:41,864
WILL: And we are very close

628
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:43,148
to finalizing a $13 million settlement

629
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,833
with Atlantic Commerce Bank.

630
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:46,051
They are not "very close."

631
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:47,019
They are in deposition.

632
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:48,804
Which is how it works, Mr. Hayden.

633
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:50,022
You negotiate in depositions.

634
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:51,673
You try to stay out of court.

635
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:53,892
Ma'am, if we had a trustee
who understood the law...

636
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:56,195
Excuse me. I know as much as anyone... !

637
00:23:56,197 --> 00:23:57,896
All right, all right.

638
00:23:57,898 --> 00:23:59,398
This is not marriage court.

639
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,900
I'm not here to make you like each other.

640
00:24:01,902 --> 00:24:03,452
But, Ms. Lockhart,

641
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:06,121
Mr. Gardner, I think you're losing
sight of the big picture here.

642
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:08,374
This isn't about you.

643
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:09,491
This is about your creditors.

644
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:11,293
- Yes, Your Honor.
- "Ma'am."

645
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:12,694
I'm not a judge.

646
00:24:12,696 --> 00:24:15,631
Excuse me, ma'am.

647
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:18,634
Our creditors are voting
with their pocketbook

648
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:20,002
by buying up our debt.

649
00:24:20,004 --> 00:24:21,754
- They are?
- WILL: Yes.

650
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:24,540
We recently got in touch with our
creditors about this mediation,

651
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:27,509
and they informed us that they
no longer are our creditors.

652
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:30,429
A consortium of financiers
called Encinal Equity

653
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:31,714
has purchased their debt.

654
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:33,682
And people don't buy bad debt.

655
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:35,217
Yes, but by that logic,

656
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:38,320
your creditors are fleeing
your debt by selling it.

657
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:39,855
People don't sell good debt.

658
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:41,608
DIANE: Ma'am, all we ask is

659
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,111
for enough time to present our arguments.

660
00:24:44,113 --> 00:24:46,530
This mediation has come
as quite a surprise to us.

661
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:47,998
How long will you need?

662
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,166
We should be prepared to present

663
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:50,417
witnesses and evidence by next week.

664
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,485
Tomorrow.

665
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:56,256
<i>CARY: Let's talk about the
swimming pool at 233 Graham Court.</i>

666
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:57,573
This one here.

667
00:24:57,575 --> 00:24:59,509
This pool had several
water features, correct?

668
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:00,710
I'm not sure what you mean.

669
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:03,012
In addition to having a
deep end and a shallow end,

670
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:05,848
there was also a diving board,
a waterfall, and a grotto?

671
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,016
Okay.

672
00:25:07,018 --> 00:25:08,351
I agree.

673
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:10,887
Was the grotto boarded up
after the bank took possession?

674
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:12,605
No.

675
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:16,392
Did you receive reports from neighbors

676
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:19,312
that the waterfall feature was
being used by skateboarders?

677
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:20,780
Where's this going, gentlemen?

678
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:22,398
Mr. Millam, would you admit

679
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,100
the pool was an attractive nuisance?

680
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:25,234
Objection.

681
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:26,402
That does not apply here.

682
00:25:26,404 --> 00:25:28,488
Kaley climbed a fence to reach the pool.

683
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,324
Which makes it a textbook
case of attractive nuisance.

684
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:33,393
It's the responsibility of the homeowner...

685
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:35,261
in this case, Atlantic Commerce Bank...

686
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:36,496
to secure the swimming pool

687
00:25:36,498 --> 00:25:38,414
and make sure it did not
become a danger to children.

688
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:40,466
Once again, there was a fence,
and your client is not a child.

689
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:42,652
WILL: Kaley Spence was
12 years old at the time.

690
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:44,887
A very young, sheltered 12.

691
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:46,889
So you were sheltered? Is that it, Kaley?

692
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:50,143
You want to question
our client, depose her.

693
00:25:53,797 --> 00:25:55,798
Oh, you sure are well-dressed.

694
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,568
Thanks.

695
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,987
And you are in my office.

696
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:02,822
FRANK: Oh, I see you two have met.

697
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:06,993
Eli Gold, Jordan Karahalios.

698
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:08,911
Oh!

699
00:26:08,913 --> 00:26:09,862
The boy wonder.

700
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:11,981
(chuckles): God, I hate that name.

701
00:26:11,983 --> 00:26:13,950
The ever-quotable Rahm Emanuel.

702
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:15,418
Never gonna live that down.

703
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,953
We were headed out to see Peter.

704
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:18,588
I figured you two should meet first.

705
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,490
Because... ?

706
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:23,492
FRANK: That thing we discussed before,

707
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,511
about how you needed a second.

708
00:26:25,513 --> 00:26:26,929
I like Peter.

709
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:29,465
He's not one of those processed sales jobs.

710
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:30,516
He's got grit.

711
00:26:30,518 --> 00:26:32,385
Jordan wants to offer you guys some time.

712
00:26:32,387 --> 00:26:33,686
He's had lots of offers.

713
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:35,054
Even Maddie Hayward, isn't that right?

714
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:36,272
Yeah, she's great.

715
00:26:36,274 --> 00:26:37,357
A little green, maybe.

716
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,008
So, you think you two can work together?

717
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,779
I heard you like to work alone, Jordan.

718
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:44,197
I do.

719
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:46,849
But I also like to learn from my elders.

720
00:26:48,786 --> 00:26:50,036
I just want to get an idea

721
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:51,353
how you might handle
certain situations, okay?

722
00:26:51,355 --> 00:26:52,538
Okay.

723
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,541
Would you ever go into a
store and take something

724
00:26:55,543 --> 00:26:56,609
without paying for it?

725
00:26:56,611 --> 00:26:58,044
KALEY: No.

726
00:26:58,046 --> 00:27:00,713
MARTHA: If you got lost in
an airport, what would you do?

727
00:27:00,715 --> 00:27:03,132
Find a policeman and ask him to help.

728
00:27:03,134 --> 00:27:06,219
Were you ever allowed to stay
home alone without a babysitter?

729
00:27:06,221 --> 00:27:08,221
Sometimes.

730
00:27:08,223 --> 00:27:09,555
Well, I used to.

731
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:11,974
Not now, because of what happened to me.

732
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:13,276
Thank you, Kaley.

733
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:14,644
That's all.

734
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:16,979
Your client is mature enough
to understand right and wrong.

735
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:18,481
Attractive nuisance does not apply here.

736
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:19,982
That's not for you to decide.

737
00:27:19,984 --> 00:27:21,768
That's right. It's for a jury.

738
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,052
Which means court.

739
00:27:23,054 --> 00:27:25,021
Which means we're not
negotiating a settlement.

740
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:29,158
Damn it.

741
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,460
Still in a holding pattern.

742
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:32,245
He's supposed to be here in an hour,

743
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:33,863
but I'm not holding my breath.

744
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:35,248
We really need Ingersol.

745
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,866
The case is going down the drain.

746
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:38,201
I think it's about this merger

747
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:39,585
- with Corsica Pacific.
- What do you mean?

748
00:27:39,587 --> 00:27:44,841
Alicia, they're stalling because they
don't want a $13 million settlement

749
00:27:44,843 --> 00:27:46,793
- to mess up this merger.
- Well, we can't wait.

750
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:49,262
Alicia, is there any way you
can get proof they're stalling?

751
00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:56,302
Bad news, unfortunately.

752
00:27:56,304 --> 00:27:57,770
Really? What a surprise.

753
00:27:57,772 --> 00:27:59,421
Yeah, it'll have to be
pushed till this afternoon.

754
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:00,723
Something came up at the last minute.

755
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:05,928
I say, it's pushed till this afternoon.

756
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,066
I thought we would use this
time to depose someone else.

757
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:11,767
- What, for practice?
- Rita!

758
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:13,286
What's going on here, Alicia?

759
00:28:13,288 --> 00:28:15,905
Please have a seat, Ms. Neves.

760
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:19,959
Would you state your name and
your occupation for the record?

761
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:21,277
Rita Neves.

762
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,780
I am a housekeeper here at the
Janesville Mountain Retreat.

763
00:28:24,782 --> 00:28:25,882
What, are we playing games here?

764
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:27,500
And this morning, were you near enough

765
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:30,136
to Mr. Canning to overhear
his telephone conversation?

766
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:31,754
RITA: Yes. I was in his room cleaning

767
00:28:31,756 --> 00:28:34,223
while he was talking on the phone.

768
00:28:34,225 --> 00:28:35,475
Objection. That's hearsay.

769
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:36,726
Can you describe what you heard?

770
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:39,061
He say, "No, don't come now.

771
00:28:39,063 --> 00:28:40,646
I call when Florrick steps out."

772
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:41,764
Objection.

773
00:28:41,766 --> 00:28:43,900
That had nothing to do
with Wilkes Ingersol.

774
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:45,852
Is that statement for the record?

775
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:47,520
This conversation is
totally taken out of context.

776
00:28:47,522 --> 00:28:49,638
It had nothing to do with Wilkes Ingersol.

777
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,143
It was to my... partners in Chicago.

778
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:55,828
Ed, you can come in now!

779
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,863
What now, Mrs. Florrick?

780
00:28:56,865 --> 00:28:58,314
You got some farmers you want to depose?

781
00:28:58,316 --> 00:29:00,316
Can you state your name and occupation?

782
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:02,451
Ed Jeffries. I work at the front desk.

783
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:04,987
And, um, can you tell me
how many calls were made

784
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:06,255
from Mr. Canning's hotel room?

785
00:29:06,257 --> 00:29:07,323
Objection.

786
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:09,375
Your objection has been
preserved for the record.

787
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:10,793
Please tell me how many calls

788
00:29:10,795 --> 00:29:13,763
were placed from Mr. Canning's room?

789
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:15,448
- Four.
- That is private information.

790
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,666
And were all those calls
placed to the same number?

791
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,835
Three to the Ingersol Ranch,
one to another local number.

792
00:29:19,837 --> 00:29:23,272
So no calls were placed to Mr.
Canning's partners in Chicago?

793
00:29:23,274 --> 00:29:25,775
Well, there were no calls to Chicago.

794
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:27,610
Thank you, Ed.

795
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,988
Oh.

796
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,458
Don't you want to stay
for my call to the judge?

797
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,661
Or do you want to be held
in contempt in absentia?

798
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:49,165
(dialing)

799
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:53,535
JUDGE: Given this evidence, Mr. Canning,

800
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:55,054
I rule for the plaintiff.

801
00:29:55,056 --> 00:29:57,223
Present the witness or be held in contempt.

802
00:29:57,225 --> 00:29:59,141
When is the earliest he can be deposed?

803
00:29:59,143 --> 00:30:00,509
Tomorrow morning at 10:00.

804
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:02,812
Your Honor, Mr. Canning has been
saying that for two days now.

805
00:30:02,814 --> 00:30:04,931
Mr. Ingersol is dealing
with an ongoing emergency.

806
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:06,682
Mr. Canning, have your client there

807
00:30:06,684 --> 00:30:08,935
at 10:00 a.m. or be held in contempt.

808
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:10,186
Do you understand?

809
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:11,354
I do.

810
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:13,823
(line clicks)

811
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:16,058
I'll see you at 10:00.

812
00:30:22,145 --> 00:30:24,146
I don't need a lawyer.

813
00:30:24,148 --> 00:30:27,332
Yes, but you never know about
the future, Mr. Ellstrom.

814
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:28,517
Tobin.

815
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,619
I'm not in politics anymore, Ms. Lockhart.

816
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,821
The Department of Justice is making moves

817
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:35,390
against past and current campaign managers,

818
00:30:35,392 --> 00:30:38,427
so I think that you should
review your past campaigns.

819
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:39,828
"Making moves"?

820
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,430
On what issue?

821
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:42,781
Discounts for donations.

822
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:45,884
Campaign managers offering
discounted legal services

823
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,119
in exchange for campaign contributions.

824
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:50,305
That's just Chicago politics.

825
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,958
And since you were a
lawyer prior to your work

826
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,644
as Wendy Scott-Carr's campaign strategist,

827
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,396
I thought there might be some issue there.

828
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,931
This is about Wendy Scott-Carr?

829
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,966
No.

830
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:02,634
It's about all your campaign work.

831
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:05,153
But Wendy Scott-Carr especially?

832
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,905
Okay.

833
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,407
I'll think about it.

834
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:10,242
Certainly. Here's my card.

835
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,411
Don't forget.

836
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,867
(cell phone ringtone playing)

837
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:20,352
Hello, Tobin.

838
00:31:20,354 --> 00:31:21,820
How nice to hear from you.

839
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:24,339
TOBIN: Do you know a
lawyer named Diane Lockhart?

840
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,874
Yes, I do. Why?

841
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:28,660
She just approached me
about my past work with you.

842
00:31:28,662 --> 00:31:30,662
She did?

843
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:32,497
Yeah, she said the Department
of Justice is investigating

844
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:34,332
discounts for donations, and
that I might be implicated.

845
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:36,301
(sighs)

846
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:38,303
She wanted you to call me.

847
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:39,304
What?

848
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:40,806
She wanted you to call me

849
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:42,774
so I would know that if I pursue them

850
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,011
on discounts for donations,
they'll pull you in.

851
00:31:46,013 --> 00:31:47,362
No, she just wanted me to hire her.

852
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,363
No, Tobin, she didn't.

853
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:51,650
This was a warning shot across my bow.

854
00:31:51,652 --> 00:31:53,685
So what are you gonna do?

855
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:55,871
We ran a clean campaign, Tobin, didn't we?

856
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:58,991
Well, yes, but nothing's 100%.

857
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:02,878
No, we ran a clean campaign.

858
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,196
Just don't talk to her again.

859
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,868
(knocking)

860
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,218
Kalinda.

861
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,570
And clothes.

862
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,355
And incidentals.

863
00:32:30,357 --> 00:32:32,574
Ah.

864
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:39,998
(sighs): God, it's quiet.

865
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:43,935
Yeah.

866
00:32:43,937 --> 00:32:45,504
You've had two days of this?

867
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:47,456
And two nights.

868
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,007
It's not that bad, actually.

869
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,459
(sighs)

870
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:51,510
Really?

871
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:52,928
I'd kill someone.

872
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:58,300
You know what I miss about my old life?

873
00:32:58,302 --> 00:33:00,802
Before the glamour of the law?

874
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:02,921
What?

875
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:05,107
The quiet.

876
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:08,143
At home, in the afternoons,

877
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:11,279
I would drink every day at 3:00.

878
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,199
A glass of red wine.

879
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,952
Waiting for the kids to come home.

880
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:23,191
I miss the silence in the house at 3:00.

881
00:33:23,193 --> 00:33:25,377
Just...

882
00:33:26,662 --> 00:33:28,880
nothing going on.

883
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,585
I miss this.

884
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:40,425
Yeah.

885
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:42,944
(chuckles softly)

886
00:33:42,946 --> 00:33:44,796
I'm sorry.

887
00:33:49,018 --> 00:33:51,269
I know.

888
00:33:53,856 --> 00:33:56,074
(chuckles softly)

889
00:33:57,977 --> 00:34:01,963
You know, I don't think Ingersol's
gonna show up tomorrow at 10:00.

890
00:34:01,965 --> 00:34:03,532
I know.

891
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,534
Cary thinks that they're trying to avoid

892
00:34:05,536 --> 00:34:07,753
a road bump in their merger.

893
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:11,923
Do you have that other
number Canning was calling?

894
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:15,994
There were three to the ranch
and one to a local number.

895
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:17,328
Yeah.

896
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,680
What's your thinking?

897
00:34:19,498 --> 00:34:21,299
(sighs): I don't know.

898
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:23,468
Maybe there's a real emergency.

899
00:34:25,905 --> 00:34:29,241
Cary Agos. A fourth-year
associate at Lockhart/Gardner.

900
00:34:29,243 --> 00:34:33,344
DIANE: And were you asked by
Mr. Hayden for your assistance

901
00:34:33,346 --> 00:34:35,530
- over the last three months?
- Yes.

902
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,483
And for how many hours a week
were you asked to help him?

903
00:34:38,485 --> 00:34:39,651
Roughly...

904
00:34:39,653 --> 00:34:40,952
ten hours a week.

905
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,621
And this was done on your time?

906
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,406
CARY: As a fourth-year associate,

907
00:34:44,308 --> 00:34:46,892
very few hours in a day
actually constitute my time.

908
00:34:46,994 --> 00:34:47,809
But you managed?

909
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:49,995
Yes. Yes, I did manage.

910
00:34:49,997 --> 00:34:53,048
DIANE: And what did Mr. Hayden ask of you?

911
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,301
He asked me to be his tutor.

912
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,702
DIANE: His tutor?

913
00:34:57,704 --> 00:34:59,304
Yes.

914
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,240
He asked me to help him study
for the upcoming bar exam.

915
00:35:02,242 --> 00:35:04,593
DIANE: And what prompted that arrangement?

916
00:35:04,595 --> 00:35:07,596
Mr. Hayden had attended
law school years earlier,

917
00:35:07,598 --> 00:35:10,315
but never attempted to pass the bar.

918
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:13,985
Now working at Lockhart/Gardner
had reinvigorated him.

919
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:18,490
DIANE: And did you feel you had any
choice in the matter but to help him?

920
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:22,761
No.

921
00:35:22,763 --> 00:35:25,230
Thank you, Mr. Agos.

922
00:35:26,065 --> 00:35:28,500
Anything, Mr. Hayden?

923
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,538
Uh, yes.

924
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,259
Uh, you stated that fourth-year associates

925
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,628
rarely have time of their own.

926
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,795
Yes.

927
00:35:40,797 --> 00:35:43,598
But you found the time to help me?

928
00:35:45,401 --> 00:35:48,436
I didn't feel as if I had a choice.

929
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,439
You held sway over the entire firm.

930
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:56,728
Isn't it true that I offered
to pay you for your assistance?

931
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,280
Yes, you did.

932
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:00,615
- And did you refuse my offer?
- Yes.

933
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,018
Did I ever state or imply
that you would be afforded

934
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,536
preferential treatment for your help?

935
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:07,372
- No, you did not.
- Did I ever state or imply

936
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,942
that you would be penalized
if you refused to help me?

937
00:36:11,777 --> 00:36:14,663
No, you did not.

938
00:36:14,665 --> 00:36:17,716
- Your Honor...
- "Ma'am."

939
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:20,302
Ma'am.

940
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,637
Lockhart/Gardner...

941
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,589
has no shame

942
00:36:24,591 --> 00:36:28,093
in trying to besmirch my name
for their own personal gain.

943
00:36:28,095 --> 00:36:29,361
It goes to their...

944
00:36:29,363 --> 00:36:33,631
illogical passion for winning at all costs.

945
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:39,304
Once again, I ask that Diane
Lockhart and Will Gardner

946
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:42,524
be removed from their
managerial positions at the firm.

947
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:46,861
I'll take your words under
advisement, Mr. Hayden.

948
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,180
Ingersol's not dodging the depositions

949
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:06,298
because of the merger.

950
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,849
WILL: Why then?

951
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,502
He's been seeking treatment at
an experimental cancer center.

952
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,172
He's... since when?

953
00:37:14,174 --> 00:37:16,191
A few months ago. The number Canning

954
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:19,361
dialed from here was a center
run by Vivek Assadullah,

955
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:21,179
a cancer specialist.

956
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:23,898
Ingersol's battling non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

957
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,483
That's not public knowledge.

958
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:26,818
No, it's not.

959
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,186
Thanks, Kalinda. Is Alicia there?

960
00:37:28,188 --> 00:37:30,372
Sure. Alicia.

961
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,658
Yeah?

962
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,710
Use it. They don't want it
to come out before the merger.

963
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,412
I know. I'm on it.

964
00:37:37,414 --> 00:37:39,030
(indistinct chattering)

965
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:41,833
What the hell?

966
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:44,502
Oh, no. Ms. Scott-Carr,
do you have an appointment?

967
00:37:44,504 --> 00:37:47,305
No. We're here to
confiscate Eli Gold's files.

968
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,391
He operated his crisis management firm

969
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,760
out of these offices,
which makes Lockhart/Gardner

970
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:53,428
open to investigation as well.

971
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,929
That is bizarrely tenuous.

972
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:58,016
And yet, supported by the judge.

973
00:37:58,884 --> 00:38:00,068
Thank you...

974
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,220
for the warning shot.

975
00:38:02,222 --> 00:38:04,155
It gave me time to acquire the warrant.

976
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,557
This investigation is so hypocritical.

977
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,444
Okay, the files in here first.

978
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:21,269
(clock ticking)

979
00:38:23,272 --> 00:38:24,573
Don't worry. He's coming.

980
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:26,641
He's just... a few minutes late.

981
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:32,797
(car approaching)

982
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:37,619
O ye of little faith.

983
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:40,539
(car doors shut)

984
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,873
ALICIA: Good afternoon, Mr. Ingersol,

985
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,258
- and welcome back.
- Thank you.

986
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,493
How are you feeling today?

987
00:38:46,328 --> 00:38:47,996
Good. Why?

988
00:38:47,998 --> 00:38:50,131
Just a pleasantry.

989
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:52,934
Well... thank you.

990
00:38:52,936 --> 00:38:54,936
I'm good. (chuckles)

991
00:38:54,938 --> 00:38:57,939
Good. Why don't we pick
up where we left off.

992
00:38:57,941 --> 00:38:59,441
Did you see this letter

993
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:01,810
that was written by the
residents of the community,

994
00:39:01,812 --> 00:39:04,145
complaining about the state
of the five foreclosed homes

995
00:39:04,147 --> 00:39:05,313
and their swimming pools?

996
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:06,848
I, uh, did not.

997
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,066
You see it's addressed to you?

998
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:09,217
I do.

999
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:11,152
If I read every letter addressed to me,

1000
00:39:11,154 --> 00:39:13,521
I wouldn't have time to... shave or sleep.

1001
00:39:13,523 --> 00:39:16,157
(chuckling)

1002
00:39:17,192 --> 00:39:18,877
So that answers that, Alicia.

1003
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,795
Any other questions?

1004
00:39:20,797 --> 00:39:22,530
Mr. Ingersol, are you aware

1005
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:25,300
that it is an SEC violation
to withhold an illness

1006
00:39:25,302 --> 00:39:26,968
from shareholders?

1007
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,670
Objection. Relevance.

1008
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:30,088
Your objection has been noted.

1009
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,841
Are you aware that it is an SEC violation?

1010
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,846
Yes, but I'm not sure what this
has to do with your lawsuit.

1011
00:39:37,848 --> 00:39:41,666
It has to do with your
intent to delay, Mr. Ingersol.

1012
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:44,069
Atlantic Commerce is a
publicly held company.

1013
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:47,022
The shareholders have a
right to know if the leader

1014
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:50,108
is facing a critical illness.

1015
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,360
And according to his profile,

1016
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:54,696
Dr. Vivek Assadullah is a specialist

1017
00:39:54,698 --> 00:39:56,448
who conducts experimental treatments

1018
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,500
- for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
- CANNING: Objection.

1019
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:03,121
- This is beneath you, Alicia.
- No, unfortunately, it's not.

1020
00:40:07,877 --> 00:40:12,130
The emergency you were dealing
with, Mr. Ingersol, was...

1021
00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:14,666
uh, Ms. Court Reporter,

1022
00:40:14,668 --> 00:40:16,768
do you mind stepping
out for a moment, please?

1023
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,687
My name is Mika.

1024
00:40:18,689 --> 00:40:21,389
So sorry. Mika. Of course.

1025
00:40:24,744 --> 00:40:27,428
(door opens) You were being
treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma,

1026
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,430
and you didn't want this
knowledge made public

1027
00:40:29,432 --> 00:40:31,716
before your merger with Corsica Pacific.

1028
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:37,872
This does not have to go
on the record, Mr. Ingersol.

1029
00:40:37,874 --> 00:40:39,824
We have been trying for weeks now

1030
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:41,643
to negotiate with Mr. Canning.

1031
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:45,413
And if you approve this
settlement of $15 million,

1032
00:40:45,415 --> 00:40:48,249
the questioning can end right here.

1033
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:56,141
(door opens)

1034
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:59,010
DIANE: Uh, one second, Eli.

1035
00:40:59,012 --> 00:41:00,095
(quietly): Alicia?

1036
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:01,563
Yes. $12 million.

1037
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:02,731
$3 million to us.

1038
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:04,349
Uh, good.

1039
00:41:04,351 --> 00:41:06,017
I'll be right there. Yeah.

1040
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:08,803
As I was saying, Eli, unfortunately,

1041
00:41:08,805 --> 00:41:11,856
- this changes everything.
- Wendy's doing this so you can't be my lawyer.

1042
00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:14,359
I know. But now that we're part of this...

1043
00:41:14,361 --> 00:41:16,144
probe into your practices,

1044
00:41:16,146 --> 00:41:17,946
we are precluded from representing you.

1045
00:41:17,948 --> 00:41:19,647
We have a list of potential attorneys.

1046
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:20,915
I've called the top three.

1047
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:23,835
- All are ready for your call.
- And so it goes,

1048
00:41:23,837 --> 00:41:27,005
the endless cycle of
Chicago investigations.

1049
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:30,324
JORDAN: Hey, guys. Do you know
when the old man is coming back?

1050
00:41:30,326 --> 00:41:32,510
Eli. There you are.

1051
00:41:32,512 --> 00:41:34,045
Let's talk about debate prep.

1052
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:35,797
- Let's.- Maddie Hayward is

1053
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:37,015
putting all her time into prep.

1054
00:41:37,017 --> 00:41:38,499
That's when she really
wants to make her mark.

1055
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:40,001
And I looked at the schedule, and you...

1056
00:41:40,003 --> 00:41:41,886
you barely have Peter down.

1057
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,306
<i>WILL: We received a settlement
offer today for $12 million.</i>

1058
00:41:45,308 --> 00:41:47,175
DIANE: And just today, Encinal Equity

1059
00:41:47,177 --> 00:41:49,894
completed their purchase
of Lockhart/Gardner debt.

1060
00:41:49,896 --> 00:41:52,731
They are invested in our financial health,

1061
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:54,199
and we intend to honor that commitment.

1062
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:55,650
Mr. Hayden,

1063
00:41:55,652 --> 00:42:00,121
I understand your disappointment
in losing a merger opportunity,

1064
00:42:00,123 --> 00:42:03,825
but I do believe this
purchase of debt suggests

1065
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:06,795
the financial community
has faith in management.

1066
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:08,696
Therefore, I have determined

1067
00:42:08,698 --> 00:42:11,332
<i>Ms. Lockhart and Mr. Gardner not</i>

1068
00:42:11,334 --> 00:42:12,751
be removed as managing partners

1069
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:17,005
and that they continue to
work, with your guidance,

1070
00:42:17,007 --> 00:42:19,674
toward financial health.
After the deadline,

1071
00:42:19,676 --> 00:42:21,342
five weeks from now,

1072
00:42:21,344 --> 00:42:24,345
Mr. Hayden, then you might
find a merger partner.

1073
00:42:24,347 --> 00:42:26,981
That's my ruling.

1074
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:32,270
(door shuts) Escaped the executioner.

1075
00:42:32,272 --> 00:42:33,655
WILL: For now.

1076
00:42:33,657 --> 00:42:35,740
We can never meet a five-week deadline.

1077
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:37,275
I know.

1078
00:42:37,277 --> 00:42:39,393
We talk to the new creditor.

1079
00:42:39,395 --> 00:42:41,079
Get an extension?

1080
00:42:41,081 --> 00:42:42,614
(thunder rumbles)

1081
00:42:46,268 --> 00:42:47,836
<i>SIMONE: Alicia.</i>

1082
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:50,255
I'm so sorry we didn't
get to have that breakfast.

1083
00:42:50,257 --> 00:42:51,506
Oh, me, too.

1084
00:42:51,508 --> 00:42:52,624
You heading out?

1085
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:54,793
Yeah, Louis has business, so...

1086
00:42:54,795 --> 00:42:56,244
no rest.

1087
00:42:56,246 --> 00:42:57,545
Be seeing you soon.

1088
00:42:57,547 --> 00:42:59,180
And why's that?

1089
00:42:59,182 --> 00:43:01,132
Oh, you didn't hear?

1090
00:43:02,051 --> 00:43:04,752
I purchased the Lockhart/Gardner debt.

1091
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:07,255
I'm your new creditor.

1092
00:43:08,057 --> 00:43:09,557
You two will be working together?

1093
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:10,558
That's fantastic.

1094
00:43:18,451 --> 00:43:28,559
