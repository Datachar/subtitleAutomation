00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:02,980
<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"... </i>

2
00:00:03,014 --> 00:00:04,515
I never felt at home at Buckner.

3
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:06,650
Going to Carlton doesn't make any sense.

4
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:08,552
They do have this new pilot program

5
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:11,422
for kids with deaf
parents or deaf siblings.

6
00:00:11,456 --> 00:00:13,424
We need somebody that
everybody's familiar with.

7
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,025
Like a brand.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,194
John, you're a leader.
You deserve a third act.

9
00:00:17,228 --> 00:00:18,162
Think about it.

10
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:20,130
No turning back now.

11
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:22,926
I thought maybe you wanted to know
that you had another one on the way.

12
00:00:22,927 --> 00:00:25,230
_

13
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:27,938
She hates me for no
reason, other than the fact

14
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:28,906
that I'm hearing.

15
00:00:31,976 --> 00:00:33,610
Look, I don't know what your deal is.

16
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:36,413
If this is something about Emmett or...

17
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:39,166
_

18
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:42,811
_

19
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:49,293
So I re-read "The Scarlet Letter"

20
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:52,429
and I learned all of the relevant signs.

21
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:54,364
"Adultery, "hypocrisy,"

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,334
"who thought it was a good
idea to cast Demi Moore

23
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:59,937
as Hester Prynne?" And I have not

24
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:03,240
slowed down the class
once in the last week.

25
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:07,015
_

26
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:09,146
(Sighs) Well, uh,

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,214
next up, Shakespeare.

28
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:12,883
I may have to use up my sick days.

29
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:16,379
_

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,023
Yeah. Hey, um, maybe we can
even sit with your old crew.

31
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:28,665
Or not.

33
00:01:44,682 --> 00:01:45,716
Nice work.

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,321
Noah. Pilot program.

35
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:52,689
We have like every class together.

36
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:55,292
Noah, I know who you are.

37
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:57,528
There's only like seven of us.

38
00:01:57,562 --> 00:02:00,330
I'm sorry. Look, I'm distracted right now.

39
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:03,233
Trying to fix this. Someone wrote
something really nasty on my locker.

40
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:04,268
Oh, yeah.

41
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:07,271
They shoved a note in mine too.

42
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:08,672
There's Ms. Bledsoe.

43
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:10,440
Maybe we should tell her.

44
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:13,277
Uh, yeah. And add "rat"

45
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:14,545
to my list of crimes against deaf humanity?

46
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:16,346
No, thank you.

47
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,090
_

48
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:23,253
Uhh...

49
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:25,489
just personalizing my locker.

50
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:28,592
_

51
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:31,728
Uh, "let" may be too strong of a word.

52
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:35,748
_

53
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:38,987
_

54
00:02:38,988 --> 00:02:39,988
_

55
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,556
_

56
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:54,284
Where's a volleyball
when you need one, huh?

57
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,652
You heard about that?

58
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:57,487
(Chuckles)

59
00:03:01,426 --> 00:03:03,627
<i>Daphne: Something happened.
But Bay won't say what.</i>

60
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:07,631
Some of the deaf kids don't
like the pilot program.

61
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:10,634
You'd think that people who
had been bullied themselves

62
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:13,303
would be the last ones
to do it to someone else.

63
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,406
But Bay's all right?

64
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:17,641
She seems to be.

65
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:22,312
Can you finish up?

66
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:23,513
<i>My telenovela is on.</i>

67
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:26,583
Mom, wait. I need to talk to you.

68
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:27,584
Both of you.

69
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:29,353
<i>I know that tone.</i>

70
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:31,288
- Angelo.
- Yes.

71
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:32,289
It's Angelo.

72
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:34,791
He's gonna be a father again.

73
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:36,760
- What?!
- You're pregnant?!

74
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:38,428
No. Not me.

75
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:40,731
He got someone else pregnant?

76
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,467
Yeah.

77
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:44,668
Of course he did.

78
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:47,337
Do we know who she is?

79
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:49,539
Her name is Lana.

80
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:51,608
And she's a medical student at U.M.K.C.

81
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:54,778
Young. Of course.

82
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:58,415
<i>They met on the plane going back to Italy.</i>

83
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,417
(Chuckling) Oh, that's just perfect.

84
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:02,586
Mom! Please. Can I get through this?

85
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,787
Is she African-American?

86
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,689
- Pretty?
- Yeah.

87
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:08,558
You know her?

88
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,560
She came to the court looking for Angelo,

89
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,763
and both Bay and Daphne met her.

90
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:14,498
They just didn't know who she was.

91
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:16,833
Bay knows?

92
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,402
Everyone knows.

93
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:22,639
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you when I found out.

94
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:24,808
But I knew what you would say.

95
00:04:24,842 --> 00:04:27,511
And it seemed as if you and Angelo
had finally buried the hatchet.

96
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:29,780
I know where I'd like to bury a hatchet.

97
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:31,682
<i>Isn't your novela starting?</i>

98
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:34,651
Yes, but they're bound to be a letdown.

99
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:36,586
<i>Nothing they write in the telenovelas</i>

100
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:38,755
can hold a candle to Angelo's real life.

101
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,696
<i>(Door closes)</i>

102
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,863
I'm sorry, honey.

103
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:50,534
Honestly, it really doesn't affect me.

104
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:51,535
Are you okay?

105
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,804
I really thought he had changed.

106
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:57,808
Hey, do you remember that day spa

107
00:04:57,842 --> 00:04:59,676
that you and I went to when I

108
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:01,812
hurt my shoulder playing basketball?

109
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:03,547
Yeah.

110
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,716
Let's go there again. This weekend.

111
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,451
Just you and me.

112
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:10,387
It'll be a "suck it, Angelo" spa party.

113
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:11,555
And he can pay for it.

114
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:13,357
I'll use the money from the food truck.

115
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:16,426
That sounds fantastic.

116
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:17,594
Perfect.

117
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:24,568
Ivan: For the first few events,

118
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:26,737
- you'll be preaching totally to the choir.
- John: Uh-huh.

119
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,472
Give you a chance to work out

120
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:29,673
- your stump speech.
- Okay.

121
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:31,641
Oh, and Kathryn, we've got you booked

122
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:33,643
on Dara Walker's radio show.

123
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:35,645
So you can share your favorite recipe

124
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,681
- with all of her listeners.
- Great.

125
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:39,483
Sorry to interrupt. Uh, mom, can I borrow

126
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:40,484
your car again?

127
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:42,452
I gotta go to rehearsal.

128
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:44,621
Oh, sure, honey. When
is yours gonna be fixed?

129
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:45,689
Not till Saturday.

130
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:47,491
<i>Thanks, though.</i>

131
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:48,658
Okay, see you.

132
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:50,827
Mm. Ivan, here's the thing.

133
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:53,397
I'm not interested in
memorizing talking points.

134
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:55,665
It's one of the things that drives me crazy

135
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,501
when I watch these national guys campaign.

136
00:05:57,535 --> 00:05:59,436
- It's just the same canned crap...
- (Ivan chuckles)

137
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,671
over and over and over.

138
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,740
And John's great at speaking off-the-cuff.

139
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,776
We've been getting very
familiar with the issues.

140
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,712
I'd like to focus on
education and immigration.

141
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:09,746
And you will.

142
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:11,415
When you get elected.

143
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:13,650
During the campaign, the
trick is to keep it general.

144
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:15,819
Pro-middle class, anti-big government.

145
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:16,820
<i>But I think what</i>

146
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:18,789
John has to say on

147
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:20,757
<i>education and immigration</i>

148
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:22,859
will really resonate with
people in our district.

149
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:24,694
You're running in a conservative district

150
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,930
in a solidly G.O.P. state. People love you.

151
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:30,534
All you have to do to get
elected is to be yourself,

152
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:31,768
talk about your business successes

153
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:33,737
and tell that great story
about the home run you hit

154
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:34,771
in the '92 all-star game.

155
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:37,774
You can't lose.

156
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,644
Hey, this is the recipe you should share.

157
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:42,646
These are delicious.

158
00:06:43,948 --> 00:06:45,582
I bought 'em.

159
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:47,484
Hmm.

160
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:50,654
I am gonna make stickers.

161
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:53,423
If Natalie wants to fight
it out with graffiti,

162
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,492
she picked the wrong girl.

163
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:58,587
_

164
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:01,198
She is the one who is throwing gasoline.

165
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:03,266
And I've tried to make peace.

166
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:06,269
And I'm trying to keep up,
but she just keeps hating me

167
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:08,205
because I can hear.

168
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:10,974
And that's like hating me

169
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:13,877
because I have brown hair or brown eyes.

170
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,847
There's nothing that I can do about it.

171
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:21,574
_

172
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:25,950
_

173
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,531
_

174
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:31,561
Wow, that sucks.

175
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:38,201
But we didn't ask for any cuts.

176
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,103
And if Natalie and her posse

177
00:07:40,138 --> 00:07:42,139
keep taking it out on the hearing kids,

178
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:43,294
we're just gonna fight back.

179
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:55,416
_

180
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,423
_

181
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:04,670
_

182
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,671
_

183
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:10,204
_

184
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:13,212
_

185

189
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:33,557
Hi. Uh, Noah.

190
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:35,692
- Bay: Very funny.
- (Chuckles)

191
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:38,628
Are you ready for the A.S.L. test?

192
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:40,830
Uh, yes. You?

193
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:44,467
I think I understand everything.

194
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:47,370
Mm, except for "understand."

195
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:48,772
This is "understand."

196
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:50,640
You signed "horny."

197
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:53,376
Mm. Crap.

198
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:55,012
I haven't gotten one full sentence right.

199
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:59,416
Great, what do you think they've cut now?

200
00:09:01,452 --> 00:09:02,485
Hey, what's going on?

201
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:05,190
_

202
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:08,630
_

203
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:10,260
"Student tolerance retreat this weekend.

204
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:12,162
- Attendance mandatory."
- (Bay sighs)

205
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:13,356
I'm guessing I'm on the list.

206
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:15,198
Bet I am too.

207
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,802
I'm guessing so is she.

208
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:19,315
_

209
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:26,843
Thanks.

210
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,583
"Crybaby."

211
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:38,533
_

212
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:55,366
So it's all of the pilot program kids

213
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,902
and some of the deaf kids?

214
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:59,136
Yup.

215
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:01,205
At a tolerance retreat?

216
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,840
Mm-hmm.

217
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,809
But there isn't a problem?

218
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,586
Okay, maybe there were
a few misunderstandings.

219
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:18,623
But that's just because the
whole thing is new to everyone.

220
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:21,792
Bay, I know you feel like you have to
make it sound like everything is fine

221
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:23,461
because you pushed so hard, but...

222
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:25,329
Mom, everything is fine.

223
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:27,265
And I promise if I need you guys,

224
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:29,367
I will tell you, okay?

225
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,235
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

226
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,303
Have fun.

227
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:35,406
<i>(Door opens and closes)</i>

228
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,208
I knew this school wasn't a good idea.

229
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:44,081
At Buckner,

230
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:46,784
when there were problems
with groups of kids,

231
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:49,059
we would have assemblies...
we'd do trust falls in the gym

232
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:51,722
or pass around like a talking stick.

233
00:10:51,757 --> 00:10:54,859
We were not sent into the woods
to reenact "The Hunger Games."

234
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:56,694
Maybe you should have thought about that

235
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:59,263
before you hit Natalie with a volleyball.

236
00:10:59,298 --> 00:11:01,432
(Scoffs) I apologized for that.

237
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:04,268
And then she was the
one who bombed my locker.

238
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:07,371
Oh, so you're just an
innocent victim in all of this.

239
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:10,107
I told I was sorry you
and the leadership kids

240
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:13,177
got dragged into this,
but maybe if you weren't

241
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:15,212
such an upstanding student...

242
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:18,082
Wait, now it's my fault that I
have to spend my weekend doing this?

243
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:20,117
No, I'm just saying it's not my fault.

244
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:21,752
Okay, I was supposed to bring my mom

245
00:11:21,787 --> 00:11:22,954
to the spa this weekend,

246
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:25,623
because she was feeling so bad about Angelo

247
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:26,991
and his new baby.

248
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:30,461
Something that you didn't
bother telling me about.

249
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:31,596
Why didn't you tell me?

250
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:34,465
I should have, I know.

251
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:37,635
But when I found out, Regina didn't know.

252
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:42,173
And then Angelo and I
got into this big fight.

253
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,507
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:45,443
I have to go get the rest of my stuff.

255
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:50,948
(Sighs)

256
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:54,885
Okay, I guess I'm ready to go.

257
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,187
Try not to be too mad at Bay.

258
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:58,990
I'm sure she feels bad
about all of this too.

259
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:00,791
I know. I just...

260
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:02,793
I was really looking forward
to spending time with you.

261
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:03,928
Me too.

262
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:06,897
(Sighs) But we can just do next weekend.

263
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:09,900
And while you're gone I can
catch up on "Breaking Bad"

264
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:12,770
and count the amount of times
grandma says "I told you so."

265
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:14,572
Hey.

266
00:12:14,606 --> 00:12:16,440
Why don't you come with us?

267
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:18,476
- On the retreat?
- Yeah.

268
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,510
Why not?

269
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:21,078
You can hang out with Melody,

270
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:22,246
eat s'mores,

271
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,981
avoid grandma.

272
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:25,383
I do make a mean s'more.

273
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:27,051
You really do.

274
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:30,755
You know what? I think that's a great idea.

275
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:31,889
I have a doctor's
appointment in the afternoon,

276
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:33,004
but I can meet you up there.

277
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:34,825
Are you having more
problems with your hands?

278
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,961
Actually, no.

279
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:39,864
Um, this is somebody new
and she's run lots of tests

280
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:42,633
and seems optimistic.
I'm hoping for good news.

281
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:44,735
- That's so great!
- I know.

282
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,770
Come as soon as you can.

283
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:47,505
Okay.

284
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:51,208
<i>Lana: And you didn't
know two weeks ago that</i>

285
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:52,510
the parts needed to come from Germany?

286
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:54,245
We hoped we could get them locally.

287
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,347
Well, my insurance won't
cover any more rental car days.

288
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:57,481
I'm really sorry.

289
00:12:57,516 --> 00:13:00,084
I am a pregnant woman walking eight blocks

290
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:01,986
to and from the bus stop every day.

291
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,087
My wife has had four kids.

292
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:05,222
She says exercise is
good for you and the baby.

293
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:07,024
Helps with the delivery.

294
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:09,060
Oh, really? Dr. Larry.

295
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:10,995
Is there any other medical
advice you would like

296
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,830
to give me or my unborn child?

297
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:15,066
- Hi.
- We are not done here.

298
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,767
No, sorry. Um...

299
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:19,603
- Don't know if you remember me, but...
- Yeah.

300
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:21,439
From Angelo's place.

301
00:13:21,473 --> 00:13:23,507
Right. Yeah. Can I help?

302
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,769
I swear her car will be ready tomorrow.

303
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,570
Well, mine's done now. I could give you

304
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,540
a ride home today and bring you
back tomorrow, if that would help.

305
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:30,508
Tomorrow.

306
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,410
As God as my witness.

307
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,983
Um, okay, I... I really
don't wanna put you out.

308
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:41,085
You're not.

309
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,119
Okay. Thanks.

310
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,087
Sure.

(Chuckles)

323
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,707
There better not be
contraband in there, camper.

324
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,536
And if there is? But I'm willing to share.

325
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,438
Ah, I really don't see a problem then.

326
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,673

327
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,675
Whoa, how much contraband
have you consumed?

00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,712
Noah, whoa! Are you okay?

330
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,447
(Exhales deeply)

331
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,448
I just need a minute.

332
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,484
(Clears throat)

333
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,352
What's going on?

334
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,456
Um...

335
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,292
I have this thing

336
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,494
called Meniere's disease.

337
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,195
(Sniffs)

338
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,431
It messes with my... my
balance and my hearing and stuff.

339
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:07,037
What do you mean "messes with"?

340
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,174
Uh, I just get dizzy spells.

341
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,144
They last for a few minutes or all day.

342
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,079
<i>I've lost 60% of the
hearing in my right ear.</i>

343
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:17,815
And eventually...

344
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:19,483
I could lose it all.

345
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,720
<i>When we went around in
the circle that first day,</i>

346
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,388
I thought you said you were at Carlton

347
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:25,723
because you had deaf relatives.

348
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:27,324
Yeah, my Uncle.

349
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,626
He's got Meniere's too.

350
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,693
<i>- (Chuckles)
- Right.</i>

351
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:32,116
My parents figured that it'd be good

352
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,385
to get a head start on
the whole hand thing.

353
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:38,322
It's incredible, you know?

354
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:40,324
One day you're fine, and the next...

355
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:42,059
whole life changes.

356
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:46,764
Yeah.

357
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:48,733
It's crazy how that can happen.

358
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:51,969
Why didn't you just tell everybody

359
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:53,738
that you have Meniere's?

360
00:15:53,772 --> 00:15:56,474
I don't really like to talk about it.

361
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,277
Well...

362
00:16:00,312 --> 00:16:03,314
you wanna hear my "your whole
life changes in a day" story?

363
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:05,516
(Chuckling) You've got one too?

364
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,384
Get comfortable.

<i>Bay: Um, so we took this blood
test in bio class and, well... </i>

367
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:20,313
<i>Jane: Welcome. I can see you're
all very excited to be here.</i>

368
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:23,416
Well, you have been selected to participate

369
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:25,452
in this team-building weekend because...

370
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:28,288
<i>you are either a role model at Carlton,</i>

371
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,323
<i>a troublemaker... </i>

372
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:32,125
<i>or a target.</i>

373
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,426
<i>Your first assignment</i>

374
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:35,395
will be to replicate

375
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,331
<i>the object that's under this tarp.</i>

376
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,233
<i>You will be split up into groups of five... </i>

377
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:44,804
<i>one looker, two runners</i>

378
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,740
<i>and two builders.</i>

379
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:49,042
<i>You'll get the hang of it.</i>

380
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,610
<i>Now before you start out,</i>

381
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,846
<i>please remember: You must always sign.</i>

382
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:55,482
<i>Okay.</i>

383
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,650
First group:

384
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:59,286
<i>Daphne.</i>

385
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:02,188
<i>Natalie.</i>

386
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:03,323
Jane: Bay.

387
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,993
<i>Noah.</i>

388
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:08,161
<i>And Emmett.</i>

389
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:15,268
<i>Second group:</i>

390
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:17,737
<i>Jennifer.</i>

391
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:19,706
<i>Tony.</i>

392
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,107
<i>Amy.</i>

393
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:22,709
<i>Howard.</i>

394
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:24,945
<i>And Liz.</i>

395
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:26,880
So Kathryn, what do you call this dish?

396
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:27,847
Just what it is...

397
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:29,849
pork chops, black beans

398
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:32,452
- and salsa.
- That is so good!

399
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,422
Now I taste the cinnamon. But what else?

400
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:38,491
Cumin, a little chili powder, ginger.

401
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:40,160
It's a rub.

402
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,362
And can you tell our listeners
how you came up with this

403
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,130
delectable combination?

404
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,867
Actually, um...

405
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,803
I got this recipe a long time ago

406
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,104
from this guy who works for John

407
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,673
at the car wash... Hector Gonzales.

408
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:57,544
I believe it's a variation
on a Guatemalan dish.

409
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:58,845
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

410
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,815
Hector started out on the
line at John's first car wash.

411
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,350
And when he opened two more,

412
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:04,651
he promoted him to manager.

413
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:05,685
He did a great job.

414
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,454
Is that when he gave you this recipe?

415
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:09,356
I... I...

416
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,390
I don't quite remember.

417
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,125
But it's so great because

418
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,228
John never forgets that we
are a nation of immigrants.

419
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,230
And he believes that we should be finding

420
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,933
legal ways to welcome people

421
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,902
who want to be part of
this great American dream.

422
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,871
Not putting up barriers to push them out.

423
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:26,673
That is very admirable.

424
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:30,910
Does your family eat a lot
of Latin-inspired dishes?

425
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:33,813
We're very inclusive.

426
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,582
We eat all kinds of food.

427
00:18:38,586 --> 00:18:39,552
(Exhales)

428
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:41,654
So can I burn this thing now?

429
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:44,391
I'm afraid the news isn't good.

430
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:46,226
But I'm feeling better.

431
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,195
That's because you haven't been doing
anything to irritate the problem.

432
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,965
Cutting hair, signing, painting.

433
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:53,233
The M.R.I. shows the beginnings

434
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:56,069
of osteonecrosis in your wrists.

435
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:57,937
And that's bad?

436
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,073
It can be.

437
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:07,013
If you don't make some changes soon,

438
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:09,682
it'll be hard to turn a doorknob,

439
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:12,485
hold a hairbrush, drive a car.

440
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,623
Okay, so what do I need
to do to make it better?

441
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:17,624
At this point,

442
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,459
it's about not making it worse.

443
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,494
(Sighs)

444
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,263
I'll just find someone else.

445
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:25,398
Regina.

446
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:28,968
You've seen over a dozen specialists.

447
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:31,905
At some point it's not about giving up.

448
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:35,075
It's just simply about
accepting your new reality.

449
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,080

uh... (Exhales)

468
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:29,996
Uh, paper, pen?

469
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,898
- Your palm's itchy?
- No no no, um...

470
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:32,966
- How do you sign "information"?
- Oh, uh,

471
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,634
- "information."
- Information. Okay, sorry.

Oh, uh, the lookers!

477
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:42,408
The lookers, yes.

00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,478
Uh, the fence!

Thank you.

481
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:48,214
Um, so we don't

482
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:51,151
have to run so far if we need

483

484
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:53,386
Yes!

485
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,054
Yes, I knew them all. Knew all those signs.

486
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,990
Ha ha! First sentence!

00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:05,052
Okay, now, she's asking

491
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,499
what we are supposed

492
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,568
to do with all this stuff.

493
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:09,569
Okay okay.

Yeah, kinda.

00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,528
Ah, but don't worry, we've
all been fooled by Angelo

512
00:21:58,562 --> 00:21:59,796
at some time or another.

513
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:02,599
He's a charming guy.

514
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:05,235
I wouldn't really know.

515
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:06,403
I barely know him.

516
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:09,239
I don't normally

517
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:10,194
meet somebody and then...

518
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:12,242

So you're not like ready
to have the baby, are you?

522
00:22:23,187 --> 00:22:25,221
I don't think so.

523
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:26,823
Good. I didn't pay attention

524
00:22:26,857 --> 00:22:28,892
to those birthing videos in health class,

525
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:30,026
so I wouldn't be much help.

526
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:31,661
Well, you don't have to worry.

I mean, if you weren't taking me home...

538
00:22:59,388 --> 00:23:02,957
I could be in a worse
accident on the freeway.

539
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:03,958
(Moaning) Oh.

540
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:05,193

- Ooh, okay.
- Okay, we're going to the hospital.

542
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:08,229
No, it's just Braxton-Hicks.

543
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,931
It's... they're practice contractions.

544
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:11,799
They're perfectly harmless...

Yep, definitely going to the hospital.

00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:18,673
Here we go.

549
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:19,941
(Groans)

550
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:23,645
Jane: So how do you all think that went?

551
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:28,783
<i>Matthew?</i>

552
00:23:28,817 --> 00:23:30,551
How'd it go for you and your group?

553
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:32,332
_

554
00:23:33,154 --> 00:23:35,619
_

555
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:37,125
<i>Maybe you should</i>

556
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:39,093
try talking and see how
good you are at that?

557
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:40,228
- Bay...
- Whoa whoa!

558
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:41,997
_

559
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:44,232
- That's not okay!
- (Overlapping arguing)

560
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:46,267
<i>- Daphne: You should not be here!
- Noah: Calm down! Hey!</i>

561
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,268
(Indistinct shouting)

562
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,870
<i>Jane: Enough! Enough.</i>

563
00:23:50,939 --> 00:23:53,074
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

564
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,454
<i>I want you to make a list</i>

565
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:09,390
<i>of all the things that you think you know</i>

566
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:11,259
<i>about your partner.</i>

567
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:12,393
<i>And when you're done,
you'll share your insights</i>

568
00:24:12,428 --> 00:24:13,361
<i>with the group.</i>

569
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:17,065
<i>Sign only. No interpreter.</i>

570
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:18,299
<i>And remember:</i>

571
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,069
You can't say anything related
to being hearing or deaf.

572
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:22,804
<i>All right.</i>

573
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:26,107
<i>Now I'm gonna break you into pairs.</i>

574
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:27,075
<i>Bay</i>

575
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:28,042
<i>and Natalie.</i>

576
00:24:29,078 --> 00:24:30,745
<i>Noah</i>

577
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:33,614
<i>and Matthew.</i>

578
00:24:38,587 --> 00:24:40,788
I do have insurance, I promise.

579
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:42,657
It's just in my other purse,

580
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:45,393
which is moronic of me.

581
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:48,296
Don't worry, we'll figure it out later.

582
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,497
You don't have to stay.

583
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,066
How else are you gonna get home?

584
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:54,001
I'll figure something out.

585
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,369
Are you sure you don't
want me to call somebody?

586
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:57,839
<i>Angelo, maybe?</i>

587
00:24:57,873 --> 00:24:59,140
Okay, not Angelo.

588
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:01,109
Um...

589
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:02,944
someone from your family? Anybody?

590
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,648
My family lives in Boston.

591
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:09,751
And they don't even know I'm pregnant.

592
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:12,453
<i>Nurse: Dr. Kornreich
thinks everything is fine.</i>

593
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:14,722
But she wanted us to get an
ultrasound just to be sure.

594
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,292
Are you the dad?

595
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:19,460
Me? No. God, no.

596
00:25:19,495 --> 00:25:21,329
<i>I mean... </i>

597
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:23,164
well, not because she's...

598
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:26,033
we've never...

599
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:27,401
I mean, we're not, you know...

600
00:25:27,436 --> 00:25:30,071
You know, we're just... we're friends.

601
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:31,973
Yes. (Exhales)

602
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,108
Um, I... I'll give you a minute.

603
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:36,010
You can stay.

604
00:25:36,044 --> 00:25:38,012
<i>You know,</i>

605
00:25:38,046 --> 00:25:39,180
if you want to.

606
00:25:40,783 --> 00:25:41,983
Okay. Sure.

607
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:46,888
There she is.

608
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:50,792
<i>Toby: Wow.</i>

609
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:53,561
That's incredible.

610
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:58,599
Yeah. It's pretty amazing.

611
00:26:03,005 --> 00:26:05,907
I try not to look.

612
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,942
It just makes it harder.

613
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:09,277
Makes what harder?

614
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:11,145
Giving her up for adoption.

615
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:16,818
Oh.

616
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,554
(Sighs)

617
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:25,359
<i>Jane: All right, enough.</i>

618
00:26:25,394 --> 00:26:26,661
<i>Bay</i>

619
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:28,563
<i>and Natalie, you're up.</i>

620
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:34,910
_

621
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:37,405
Look, if I have to...

622
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:39,051
_

623
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:42,908
_

624
00:26:43,946 --> 00:26:45,079
Okay. Fine, I'll start.

625
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:47,849
Um, Natalie Pierce is a bully.

626
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:49,183
<i>(Pen and paper clatter)</i>

627
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,327
_

628
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:58,558
_

629
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:00,862
You don't know anything about me,

630
00:27:00,896 --> 00:27:04,532
but you hate me anyway,
which makes you a bigot

631
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:05,499
and a bully.

632
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,409
_

633
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:12,440
Because every hearing person in the world

634
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:13,441
is the same, right?

635
00:27:13,475 --> 00:27:15,376
We're all out to get you.

636
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:20,248
<i>Jane: All right, settle down.</i>

637
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:23,217
<i>Now that you've let off some steam,</i>

638
00:27:23,252 --> 00:27:25,119
try again.

639
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:28,089
<i>But this time, say something positive</i>

640
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:29,824
<i>about the other.</i>

641
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:39,834
Proud.

642
00:27:41,904 --> 00:27:43,504
(Sighs and smacks lips)

643
00:27:43,553 --> 00:27:44,761
_

644
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:48,542
Tough.

645
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,421
_

646
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:55,483
Honest.

647
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,350
_

648
00:28:02,157 --> 00:28:03,090
<i>Jane: Excellent!</i>

649
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:06,127
<i>And not so hard, right?</i>

650
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:09,096
<i>I think we've all earned our s'mores.</i>

651
00:28:17,506 --> 00:28:19,607
Well, you missed all the fireworks.

652
00:28:19,641 --> 00:28:20,808
I caught a few.

653
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:21,809
I'm gonna go get some s'mores.

654
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:23,411
Hey!

655
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:24,679
You're not wearing your brace.

656
00:28:24,713 --> 00:28:26,547
That means good news, right?

657
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:28,416
Not exactly.

658
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,617
Oh.

659
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,835
_

660
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:36,157
(Chuckling)

661
00:28:37,188 --> 00:28:39,887
_

662
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,997
Yeah, did the doctor say
when you'd get better?

663
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:45,132
She said the same thing

664
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,868
that all the rest of them have said.

665
00:28:46,902 --> 00:28:49,670
That with the combination

666
00:28:49,705 --> 00:28:51,606
of learning to sign as an adult,

667
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,507
the amount of signing that I've done

668
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:55,710
and the painting and the
years of cutting hair,

669
00:28:55,744 --> 00:28:58,613
the damage is irreparable.

670
00:28:58,647 --> 00:29:00,414
And if I go back to doing what I was,

671
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:03,251
it'll get worse.

672
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:05,353
Chronic numbness, pain,

673
00:29:05,387 --> 00:29:07,188
severe arthritis.

674
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,192
What about sign language?

675
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:16,097
I can't.

676
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:19,000
Ever?

677
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:23,070
You can still sign to me.

678
00:29:23,105 --> 00:29:25,640
And I can understand it.

679
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:26,707
You never know with medicine.

680
00:29:26,742 --> 00:29:28,876
New things are happening all the time.

681
00:29:30,846 --> 00:29:35,483
I... I need to go check on my group.

682
00:29:42,145 --> 00:29:45,050
_

683
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:48,213
_

684
00:29:50,065 --> 00:29:51,332
Yes.

685
00:29:54,403 --> 00:29:55,336
What?

686
00:29:56,884 --> 00:29:59,936
_

687
00:30:00,876 --> 00:30:01,708
Meaning?

688
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:06,426
_

689
00:30:07,082 --> 00:30:08,716
You think I'm faking this?

690
00:30:08,717 --> 00:30:11,412
_

691
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:13,571
_

692
00:30:13,572 --> 00:30:15,913
_

693
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,525
_

694
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,394
If I could, why wouldn't I?

695
00:30:20,395 --> 00:30:21,502
_

696
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:23,297
_

697
00:30:23,654 --> 00:30:25,912
_

698
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:28,402
You are not in my body.

699
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:30,972
You do not know how I feel.

700
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:33,841
And if you really think that
I am not trying hard enough,

701
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,911
you are most certainly not my friend.

702
00:30:51,384 --> 00:30:54,386
(Exhales and chuckles)

703
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,121
I'm sorry.

704
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:58,123
I, uh... I haven't figured out

705
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,925
how to do that

706
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,928
without, uh, scaring someone

707
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,930
who can't hear me coming.

708
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:07,132
It's okay.

709
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,668
Are you okay?

710
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,737
Can I help?

711
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:16,642
Not unless you're a wizard or a magician.

712
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:17,843
I don't think so.

713
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:19,378
But, um,

714
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:21,680
Harry Potter didn't find out

715
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,383
that he was a wizard until he was like...

716
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:25,350
15.

717
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,585
So...

718
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,186
there's always a chance.

719
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:30,122
- 11.
- Hmm?

720
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:32,357
Harry Potter was 11 when he
found out he was a wizard.

721
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,392
Oh, right.

722
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:34,426
My bad.

723
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:44,136
I just found out that my mom
can't sign to me ever again.

724
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:47,606
She has some

725
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,575
weird physical thing

726
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,644
messing up her hands.

727
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,616
I'm sorry.

728
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,319
You're not deaf. You don't get it.

729
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:02,554
You have no idea how exhausting it is

730
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,656
to have to read lips all the time.

731
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:07,459
Imagine you found out that your parents

732
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:10,362
could never talk to you
with their voice ever again.

733
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:15,033
You had to sign with them
for the rest of your life.

734
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,271
I'm imagining.

735
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,011
If it you makes you, um,

736
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:29,848
feel any better...

737
00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:35,520
she's probably a million
times madder than you are.

738
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:41,360
It sucks to feel like
your body's betraying you.

739
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,236
I'll see you back at camp.

740
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,139
<i>- (Soft pop music playing)

741
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:57,008

00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:57,543

00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,551
(Sighs)

745
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:11,423
- Hey.
- I just got off the phone with Ivan

746
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:13,825
who told me that I need
to reign in my wife.

747
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,361
<i>- Excuse me?
- Yeah.</i>

748
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:18,630
<i>Guy's really got a way with
words, but the radio show... </i>

749
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,565
you were just supposed
to talk about recipes.

750
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,070
The only non-food thing

751
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:27,372
I said was that you
believe that new immigrants

752
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:29,141
should get a shot at the American dream.

753
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:30,175
Is that so bad?

754
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:31,376
Apparently Sawyer is already spinning it...

755
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,945
saying that I encourage
illegal immigration.

756
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,180
But that's absurd. Hector's legal.

757
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:36,748
All your guys are legal.

758
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:37,749
But you didn't say that.

759
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:39,151
(Scoffs)

760
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:41,887
Fine, we'll go the press
tomorrow with the facts.

761
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:43,889
No, the point is that it
is easy to make mistakes.

762
00:33:43,923 --> 00:33:46,658
That is why Ivan wants to
keep the message general.

763
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,561
You know, we don't want to waste
time going on the defensive,

764
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:50,695
doing damage control.

765
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,464
So that's how you wanna win this thing?

766
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:54,566
By saying nothing of substance?

767
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,603
I have spent a lot of my life

768
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:00,539
thinking I was just a dumb jock.

769
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:01,573
That is your father talking.

770
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,408
But if I am elected,

771
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:05,410
I can really do something meaningful.

772
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:09,347
I can make a difference in
how our kids are educated,

773
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:11,249
in whether or not people get jobs,

774
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:14,786
can own their own homes.
But I can't do that

775
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:16,087
if I don't win.

776
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:19,057
Then tell people your ideas.

777
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:21,092
<i>Let them vote for something.</i>

778
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:23,028
I'm sorry,

779
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,764
but I think Ivan is right.

780
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:27,632
If you're in the stronger position,

781
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,634
you don't get aggressive,

782
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:31,570
you hold steady and you let the other team

783
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:32,571
make the mistakes.

784
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,608
No more talking politics.

785
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:40,278
Fine.

786
00:34:40,313 --> 00:34:42,214
Then consider your wife reigned in.

787
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:50,222
Noah: (Off-key) * as the sun shines on

Whoa! (Chuckles)

791
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,065
Wow, payback's a bitch.

792
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,199
Payback?

793
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:03,802
Yeah, I snuck up on somebody earlier.

794
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:06,638
(Chuckling) Never mind.

795
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:07,639
How'd you find me here?

796
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:09,508
Used my superpowers.

797
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,610
I heard the singing. Don't tell anyone.

798
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:12,777
Oh.

799
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:14,513
Well, with my A.S.L. skills,

800
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:15,680
I don't think you have to worry about me

801
00:35:15,715 --> 00:35:16,781
telling anybody anything.

802
00:35:16,816 --> 00:35:18,783
True.

803
00:35:18,818 --> 00:35:21,653
I just wanted some space.

804
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:24,207
And I think your boyfriend wanted
to see a little less of me too.

805
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:26,358
Come on.

806
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:27,492
He was giving me the stink eye all day.

807
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:28,567
I kind of put it together.

808
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,496
Emmett's not my boyfriend.

809
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,100
He was.

810
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:39,037
What are you listening to anyway?

811
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:44,743
Mm.

812
00:35:44,777 --> 00:35:46,077
Nice playlist.

813
00:35:46,112 --> 00:35:47,612
<i>Yeah.</i>

814
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,881
I'm trying to commit them all to memory.

815
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:51,783
You know, for when the...

816
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:54,486
(Sighs)

817
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,688
yeah, it sucks 'cause I really love music.

818
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:58,490
So do Emmett and Daphne.

819
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,294
Emmett's even in my brother's band.

820
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,328
Seriously?

821
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:05,130
Yeah.

822
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,264
Am I an idiot?

823
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:08,066
'Cause I don't really get that.

824
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,435
I'm just saying going deaf may
not be what you think it is.

825
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,372
I hope not.

826
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,077
You wanna listen to something?

827
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:22,213
Ooh, no signing and listening to music?

828
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:23,848
Dangerous stuff.

829
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:25,183

Yeah, uh,

I got it too.

Look, um, I really don't

839
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:57,965
wanna go on another retreat.

841
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,837
Okay.

842
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:05,606
So why don't we call a truce?

843
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:09,810
The other kids can follow our example.

844
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:11,545
No more retreats.

845
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:18,970
_

846
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:21,121
No problem.

847
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:34,201
Okay, the car's coming around, so, uh...

848
00:37:34,236 --> 00:37:36,971
thanks for the ride.

849
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,005
No problem.

850
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,940
Hey, I can't stop thinking about

851
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:41,842
what you said last night at the hospital.

852
00:37:41,877 --> 00:37:43,711
About putting the baby up for adoption

853
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:45,679
and not having the family around.

854
00:37:45,714 --> 00:37:47,882
I shouldn't have even mentioned that.

855
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,950
It's really not your problem.

856
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:51,552
Oh, I know. It's just...

857
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:52,987
the baby does have a family around.

858
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,422
Other than Angelo.

859
00:37:55,457 --> 00:37:56,557
My sister.

860
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:58,525
Her sister.

861
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,362
Right.

862
00:38:01,396 --> 00:38:02,496
Bay.

863
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,597
Yeah.

864
00:38:03,632 --> 00:38:06,267
I just thought maybe
you might wanna meet her

865
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:10,371
and our family before you
make any final decisions.

866
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:13,173
But that's it. That's all I had to say.

867
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,075
So...

868
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,043
I'll see you around.

869
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:17,144

now that I'm no longer a hairdresser.

875
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:59,153
Maybe you should run for office like John.

Don't think diplomacy is my strong suit.

I can learn. I'm tough.

You are.

I've been doing hair
since I was 19 years old.
