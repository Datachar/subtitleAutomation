1
00:00:01,922 --> 00:00:03,452
<i>Previously on Revenge...</i>

2
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:05,119
Tell me who hired you
to take my sister.

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,787
She's probably dead.

4
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:08,167
Marco here claims
he set up an account

5
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:10,103
that was mysteriously drained

6
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:11,957
a week before Nolcorp
went public.

7
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:13,127
I'll write you a check.

8
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,795
51% controlling interest

9
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:17,570
and your continued good faith
as its C.E.O.

10
00:00:17,578 --> 00:00:20,661
The Ryans think your dad
killed their old man.

11
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:23,450
Is it true some old-timer
nearly bought it out there?

12
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:24,534
Daniel.

13
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:25,254
- Ashley.
- Hey.

14
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:27,661
- Daniel, this isn't what you think it is.
- What is it exactly, huh?

15
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:29,836
- No!
- Get off me. You disgust me!

16
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:31,754
We need to discuss
your son's future.

17
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:33,600
<i>You so much as lay
a hand on my son,</i>

18
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:34,973
<i>and I will kill you myself.</i>

19
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:36,970
So it's official.
He's the new C.E.O.

20
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:38,631
There is no room for you
on the board

21
00:00:38,654 --> 00:00:40,286
unless someone
willingly vacates,

22
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,655
and I don't see that happening
anytime soon.

23
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,458
I'd like to speak to you about
a matter of grave importance.

24
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:47,293
<i>It's about Daniel.</i>

25
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,680
<i>Power...</i>

26
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:51,766
<i>Born out of nature,</i>

27
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:54,268
<i>coveted by man.</i>

28
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:57,388
<i>Wars rage on,</i>

29
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:58,789
<i>and victors are crowned...</i>

30
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:00,741
Ugh!

31
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:04,729
<i>But true power
can never be lost or won.</i>

32
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,914
<i>True power comes from within.</i>

33
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,544
You're in top shape.

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,298
I have to be.

35
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:16,134
The sun's nearly up.

36
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:18,403
Round two?

37
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:21,478
How about we switch gears?

38
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:35,209
Morning, early riser.

39
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:36,710
Well,
that's an encouraging sign

40
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:38,796
given your hard-won
new title.

41
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:40,514
Being C.E.O.
of a global investment firm

42
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:42,790
isn't exactly
a 9-to-5 commitment.

43
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:45,419
Then I promise,
I'll only take a moment of your time.

44
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,328
I gather this meeting
isn't as impromptu as it feels.

45
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,348
The conglomerate I represent

46
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:00,621
is very particular
about where we invest,

47
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:03,134
in business and in people.

48
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:04,390
I agree.

49
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:06,245
It's important to know
who you're getting into bed with.

50
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,496
Before you delve deeper
into our complex association,

51
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:14,005
let me suggest you dig
a little closer to home.

52
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:16,959
Meaning?

53
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:21,750
You've already uncovered one of
your father's secret assets in Nolcorp.

54
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:25,731
Apply the same principle that led you there,
and you will find that there's

55
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:29,157
far more buried inside Grayson Global
than meets the eye.

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,346
Secrets that will make you
wealthier and more powerful

57
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:35,597
than your father ever dreamed.

58
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:46,238
Morning.

59
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:49,407
Must have slept through
my alarm.

60
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:53,395
I turned it off.

61
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:55,247
You were tossing
and turning all night.

62
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,848
I wanted you to sleep in.

63
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,663
What's going on, Jack?

64
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,982
Is there something
I need to know?

65
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:07,517
Yeah. I've, uh...

66
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,769
I've been keeping
a secret from you.

67
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,829
Our sea glass?

68
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:21,714
I was thinking you could
wear it to our wedding.

69
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:23,750
It's something new
from something old.

70
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:26,062
It's something borrowed
from the sea.

71
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:27,623
And something blue.

72
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:29,512
I love it, and I love you.

73
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:31,205
Mm.

74
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:33,090
I'd tell you two to get a room,

75
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:35,292
but, uh,
look what that led to...

76
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:37,544
your own little stowaway.

77
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:40,677
Hey, Nate.
What you got there?

78
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,098
Uh, supplies.

79
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:44,547
Hey, uh, why don't you put your
hands to better use, J.P., huh?

80
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:46,689
Maybe wipe down the bar
before we open.

81
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:49,319
You got it.

82
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:53,734
Since when do you take orders
from the Ryan brothers?

83
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:56,470
Just trying to keep
the peace, babe.

84
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:59,103
They're our partners now.
At least for the time being.

85
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:01,591
Something's not right
about 'em, Jack.

86
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,759
I can feel it.

87
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:11,885
Are you going to answer that?

88
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:19,726
Need I remind you that Daniel
is having his coffee

89
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,854
in your former office
right now.

90
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,471
Yes, an office
he's vastly unprepared for.

91
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:25,906
Why do you think
the phone keeps ringing?

92
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,791
The investors are probably
in a panic.

93
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:29,543
They're not the only ones.

94
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:31,074
The longer Daniel remains in power,

95
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:32,596
the more likely
the Initiative is to use him

96
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,303
the way they used us
all those years ago.

97
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:36,800
Daniel's shortcomings will soon
readily become apparent,

98
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:38,561
and they will just move on.

99
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,850
How can you be so glib?

100
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:42,553
Because Daniel refuses
to listen to either one of us.

101
00:04:42,587 --> 00:04:45,305
And short of telling him the truth
and sealing his doom,

102
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,325
we've done everything we could
to try and get through to him.

103
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:50,644
Not everything.

104
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,044
I just got off the phone
with Patricia Barnes.

105
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:55,340
She and her husband are going to
be spending the weekend with us.

106
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,430
Patricia and Judge Barnes?

107
00:04:57,778 --> 00:05:00,266
The man's weeks away from
a Supreme Court confirmation.

108
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,127
You'd think our home would be
the last place he'd want to be seen.

109
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:04,382
Oh, but not Patricia.

110
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,719
I just bought us the head table
at her annual Liberty Project benefit.

111
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,978
And why, pray tell,
would you want to do that?

112
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,446
Because her organization
is dedicated

113
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,904
to helping the falsely convicted
appeal their unjust verdicts.

114
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:19,401
And as a man wrongly accused
of a crime yourself,

115
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,304
this benefit
is the perfect venue

116
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:23,389
for you to begin
rehabilitating your image.

117
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,219
Well, if they sold stock
in irony,

118
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:27,662
I would be richer than
the sultan of Brunei.

119
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:30,464
When Daniel inevitably falters
as the head of Grayson Global,

120
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,053
the board is sure to welcome you back
with open arms.

121
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:34,822
Well, the question remains,

122
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,974
how do we convince Daniel
to abdicate?

123
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:38,707
We don't.

124
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:40,668
Emily Thorne does.

125
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:42,640
"Dear Mr. Clarke,

126
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:44,049
"as Dr. King once said,

127
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:46,796
"'Injustice anywhere is a threat
to justice everywhere,'

128
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,931
"and I'm afraid you've
suffered a grave injustice.

129
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:51,689
"My position during your trial

130
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:53,908
"afforded me an inside access
to the system,

131
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:55,826
"a system I truly believed in

132
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,129
"until I witnessed a man
charged with upholding the law

133
00:05:58,163 --> 00:05:59,830
"act outside of it.

134
00:05:59,865 --> 00:06:03,077
Judge Barnes has failed you,
as have I."

135
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,249
It isn't signed.

136
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:06,921
Yeah, but I'm almost certain

137
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:08,584
that James Palmer wrote it.

138
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:09,821
Who's James Palmer?

139
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:12,803
The courtroom clerk
during my father's trial.

140
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:15,897
My father's theory was that
Palmer alerted Judge Barnes

141
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:17,148
to the one member of the jury

142
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:19,377
who still believed
my father was innocent.

143
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,432
- And then Barnes passed that juror's name...
- To the Graysons.

144
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:24,605
Exactly.

145
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,906
<i>I've expressed the court's
heartfelt condolences</i>

146
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,376
<i>to juror number seven and his family,
and have recused him from service.</i>

147
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,764
<i>An alternate juror has been
added to the panel.</i>

148
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:34,850
<i>The trial will proceed
without delay.</i>

149
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:35,718
<i>Thank you.</i>

150
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:39,476
That's Palmer,
right next to Barnes.

151
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:41,346
He was killed
in a subway accident

152
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,198
three days after this
was postmarked.

153
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:45,267
They got to him before you.

154
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:50,845
If I can position myself
in front of Barnes

155
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:54,571
and raise the specter of James,
maybe I can trip him up.

156
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,905
You'd think if there were any
evidence of judicial impropriety,

157
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,484
that the Senate subcommittee
would've found it by now.

158
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:03,068
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not.

159
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,411
Hey.

160
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,276
It's okay.

161
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:14,921
If you need to leave,
you need to use the back door.

162
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:17,891
I can't have Victoria
seeing you here again.

163
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:19,592
Okay.

164
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:23,445
So glad you could
make it, Emily.

165
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,950
What a lovely view
of my beach house.

166
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:28,364
I hardly noticed.

167
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:30,802
You certainly did
the other night.

168
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:32,721
Well, I do apologize for
interrupting the evening

169
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:35,373
without your new paramour.

170
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:41,346
- You said Daniel's in trouble.
- Yes.

171
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,480
I'm afraid he's gotten himself

172
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:44,416
in over his head
with this new job.

173
00:07:44,941 --> 00:07:45,938
How so?

174
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:47,690
Running a company
like Grayson Global

175
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:50,493
requires a ruthless temperament,
and I...

176
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,195
That's not a quality that
comes naturally to Daniel.

177
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:57,550
It seemed to come naturally
when he unseated his own father.

178
00:07:57,584 --> 00:07:59,966
I assume Conrad
didn't go willingly.

179
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,287
No.

180
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:06,281
I'm not sure I understand
your concern.

181
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:08,098
Ever since
your engagement ended,

182
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:10,600
I've witnessed some disturbing
changes in Daniel's behavior.

183
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:13,797
He's become petulant and angry.

184
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:15,972
I'm sorry to hear that.

185
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,141
I knew you would be.

186
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,395
Unfortunately, my son has walled
himself off from me completely,

187
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,999
but I believe that you still have
the power to reach him.

188
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:29,494
And what makes you think that?

189
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:33,473
Because in spite of my interference
and your transgression last winter,

190
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:36,626
I'm of the opinion that my son
is very much in love with you.

191
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,328
And assuming that
you ever loved him, too,

192
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:43,197
I'm asking you to step in
and help stem the tide before it's too late.

193
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,970
Unless of course your feelings for him
were less than genuine all along.

194
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:49,105
Of course not.

195
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,985
I loved him very much.

196
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:54,344
Then remind him of the man
that he aspired to be when he was with you.

197
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:56,780
Persuade him to drop
his interest in Grayson Global,

198
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:59,316
and I will stand behind you
every step of the way,

199
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,984
come what may.

200
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:07,791
You really believe
he still loves me?

201
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:09,910
I would bet my life on it.

202

203
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:42,393
Victoria.

204
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:43,561
Robert.

205
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:47,332
- Patricia.
- Hello.

206
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,700
It's so lovely to see you both.

207
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,668
I'd like to introduce
a very dear family friend

208
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:52,672
and neighbor...
Emily Thorne.

209
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,664
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

210
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:56,825
Judge Barnes,
this must be a thrilling time for you.

211
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:58,739
Indeed.
Pleasure, Ms. Thorne.

212
00:09:58,762 --> 00:10:00,854
Victoria,
we are so grateful to you

213
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:02,356
for offering to host us
while we're in town.

214
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,529
It's a much-welcomed respite
from the hearings.

215
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:07,182
Well, you're about the only thing
that both parties can agree on.

216
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,545
You're a shoo-in.

217
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:10,097
From your mouth to congress' ears.

218
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll leave you two
to get settled.

219
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:14,785
Victoria,
thank you for the lemonade.

220
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:16,453
Ms. Thorne,
I hope to see you again.

221
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:17,904
Oh, you will.

222
00:10:17,922 --> 00:10:19,466
Emily, you are coming
to dinner tonight, aren't you?

223
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,509
Daniel will be there as well.

224
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:24,678
Who can say "no" to Victoria?

225
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:28,953
Don't you think my parents

226
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:30,655
should pay for
Jack and Amanda's wedding,

227
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:33,023
considering Amanda never even
called a lawyer

228
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:36,306
after cartwheeling off
the second-floor balcony?

229
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,000
They'd be stupid not to offer.

230
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:40,791
Earth to Declan.

231
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:43,105
Come in, Declan.

232
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:44,572
Okay.

233
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,042
When Nate and Kenny
come back in here,

234
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:50,911
I need you to help me
do something, okay?

235
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,831
Sure. What?

236
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,086
Okay.

237
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:02,640
Mm. Get this.

238
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:04,770
My mom's latest charity case?

239
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:06,050
Ex-convicts.

240
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:08,316
Which is cool, but...
but I don't know.

241
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,699
They're all so damaged.
Prison seems like hell.

242
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:15,703
What? Did I say something wrong?

243
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:23,277
Don't, little brother.
She doesn't want to hear about that.

244
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:25,413
Where'd you boyfriend go
to get more bourbon, Kentucky?

245
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:26,781
Yeah, you know what?

246
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,381
I'll go check on him.
He probably got lost.

247
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:29,861
Wait.

248
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:32,337
What?
You don't want me to hear?

249
00:11:32,388 --> 00:11:33,788
Oh!

250
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:36,693
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay.

251
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:38,994
Well, back when I was
young and dumb,

252
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:42,599
I used to live with a bunch of guys
who were, uh, what?

253
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:47,251
Purveyors of recreational...
curiosities, shall we say.

254
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:57,873
The D.E.A. busts in.
They raid the place.

255
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,357
Guess who's the only sucker
at home.

256
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,226
You. Oh, my God.

257
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:10,649
I went inside for five years

258
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:12,716
for something
I had nothing to do with.

259
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:14,298
And I'll tell you
something else.

260
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,977
It isn't like hell.

261
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:18,255
It <i>is</i> hell.

262
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:21,754
Seriously,
I never would've guessed.

263
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:24,885
Yeah, well,
I guess I clean up nice.

264
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:29,404
Obviously,
your boyfriend did get lost.

265
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:31,682
I'll be right back.
Wait.

266
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:33,232
I'll go get him.

267
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:36,778
No. I'll tell you what...
you stay here.

268
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:39,197
I'll go get him. Okay?

269
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:58,033
What the hell
is taking you so long?

270
00:12:58,054 --> 00:12:59,310
Nothing.

271
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:02,363
It's just really hard to find stuff
with all your junk in the way.

272
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,647
What is it anyway?

273
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:05,582
Wholesale coffee beans.

274
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,285
It's a side business,
and it's none of yours.

275
00:13:22,754 --> 00:13:24,988
Hey, Grace, if you could hold
all my calls till after lunch.

276
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:26,439
- Yes, Mr. Grayson.
- Thank you.

277
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:31,762
Okay.

278
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:37,948
Hi, Grace. Uh, Daniel have a minute?

279
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:40,299
I'm sorry. Mr. Grayson's gone to lunch.
You just missed him.

280
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:41,355
Ah.

281
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:42,526
Would you like me
to give him a call?

282
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,721
Nah. No, the poor guy deserves
an hour to himself.

283
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:46,644
Uh, let him enjoy
his sushi in peace.

284
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:49,265
Actually, I had him down for
a reservation at the Rider House.

285
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:50,915
Oh, well, even better.
I'll... I'll catch him later.

286
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:52,119
Okay.

287
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,962
He's headed to Rider House
on Fulton.

288
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,606
<i>Then so are we.</i>

289
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:01,166
<i>Hurry down.</i>

290
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:03,485
They're running drugs
through the bar, Jack.

291
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,515
What are we gonna do?

292
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:06,137
We're not gonna do anything.
What if they'd caught you?

293
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:07,322
But they didn't.

294
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:08,806
One of them is always here

295
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:09,908
when they try to move
that stuff, so I...

296
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,593
how else was I supposed
to find out?

297
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:12,794
Not by involving Charlotte,
for starters.

298
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:14,245
I just told her
that I needed to make sure

299
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,790
they weren't
skimming inventory.

300
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,128
Just leave her out of it
from now on.

301
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:18,797
I want us <i>all</i> out of it
from now on.

302
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:20,065
Mr. Duncan is still
in the hospital

303
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,166
after the ass beating
they gave him.

304
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,901
I know, Dec.

305
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:24,035
<i>I know.</i>

306
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,284
- Do you remember Eddie Solomon?
- Yes.

307
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:34,070
The guy used to jump me
when you two were in high school.

308
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:38,291
- He's a cop now.
- Well, that's shocking.

309
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:41,060
I think I might have
a way out of this.

310
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:47,921
Fazio.

311
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:49,822
- Hi.
- Hi.

312
00:14:51,164 --> 00:14:54,710
Hey. I expected you to go
at least a month

313
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,963
before waving the white flag.

314
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:59,749
Oh. Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint.

315
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:01,684
I'm here because
I've heard rumors

316
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:03,486
you stashed away a number
of secret investments

317
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,171
inside the company walls.

318
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:08,345
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

319
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:09,652
Oh. That's how it's gonna be,
is it?

320
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,928
Oh, yeah, Daniel. This is pretty
much exactly how it's gonna be.

321
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:15,548
You stole my company.
If there's anything else you're after,

322
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,284
you're just gonna
have to steal that, too.

323
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:20,537
Ooh.
Speaking of lost assets,

324
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:24,244
looks like Takeda's boy
is following right in your footsteps.

325
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:25,909
That Emily's
a real man-eater.

326
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:27,360
Whatever your problem is
with Daniel,

327
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:28,995
it has nothing to do with me.

328
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:30,463
My problem isn't <i>with</i> Daniel.
It's with this restaurant.

329
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,048
You knew he was gonna be here.

330
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,466
- That's crazy.
- Oh, is it?

331
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,767
Because I'm beginning to think
that the only reason

332
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:35,935
you've been dating me

333
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,220
is so that you can
keep tabs on your ex.

334
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,145
Oh, that is hilarious.
<i>You</i> asked <i>me</i> out.

335
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:40,464
If I'd have known that
you were this insecure,

336
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:41,799
I wouldn't have said "yes"
in the first place.

337
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,000
Well, maybe you shouldn't
have bothered.

338
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:44,630
Believe me, I wish I hadn't.
Good-bye, Aiden.

339
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,420
Don't call me again.

340
00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:50,308
- Are you okay?
- Daniel, I'm sorry.

341
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:51,938
- Emily, wait.
- What's going on?

342
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:54,157
What's it look like?

343
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:56,814
Your ex-fiancée
just broke up with me.

344
00:16:15,295 --> 00:16:17,495
Nolan,
I see you found my office.

345
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,358
Isn't this where I wait to get
my Grayson Global I.D. badge?

346
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:23,918
When I said I wanted to meet,
I figured we'd get one on the books.

347
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,525
Haven't you heard?
Books are obsolete.

348
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:27,763
What's up, boss?

349
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,745
I need to know if you can create
a program to identify rogue files

350
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:32,873
intentionally hidden
inside our computer system.

351
00:16:32,896 --> 00:16:37,301
Oh, listen to you,
trying to sound all... techy.

352
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:39,357
What am I looking for?

353
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:41,309
That wasn't the question.
Can you do it or not?

354
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,162
Mm. Only because I want
to make a good impression

355
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:47,542
my first week on your payroll.

356
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:49,480
Where's the London Fog?

357
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,711
I thought you two
were attached at the hip.

358
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:54,653
Probably off somewhere
licking his wounds.

359
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:57,049
Emily broke up with him today.

360
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:00,476
Really?

361
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:02,331
Hmm.

362
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,225
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>

363
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,104
Hey, toss me that pacifier.

364
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,005
Words I never thought
I'd hear you say.

365
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,109
Going somewhere?

366
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:17,377
Actually, you are.

367
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,559
I'm gonna need you and Carl
to go over to Emily's for a couple of nights.

368
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:24,775
Give us a minute, okay?

369
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,186
Yeah.

370
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:32,877
I grew up around
a lot of crappy families,

371
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:36,515
all different kinds of messed up people.
But the one thing they all had in common?

372
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:39,192
They lied to each other.

373
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:41,317
We're not gonna be
those people.

374
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:49,998
You're right.

375
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:51,299
The Ryan brothers
aren't good guys.

376
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:52,717
They rigged it so they could
buy into the bar

377
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:54,319
and use our slip
to move drugs through here.

378
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:56,325
They're the ones that put your
dad's friend in the hospital.

379
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:58,819
Which is why I need you to take Carl
and get out of here tonight.

380
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,826
Jack, we're a family.

381
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,781
I'm not gonna leave you here
to fend for yourself.

382
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:04,714
I won't be. I reached out
to my buddy on the force.

383
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:05,723
- Oh...
- He's gonna bust 'em.

384
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:07,346
Look, they'll never know I was involved.

385
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,972
I know it's not your style
to run away from a fight.

386
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,624
But I invited these people
into our lives.

387
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,443
I need you to trust me
to take them out.

388
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:16,719
- I do trust you.
- Okay.

389
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:19,769
- I can't tell you how much I hate this.
- I know.

390
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,971
Me, too.

391
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:23,907
I love you.

392
00:18:26,444 --> 00:18:29,195
Prince Oedipus
just granted me access

393
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:33,099
to the Grayson Global intranet
to snoop for him.

394
00:18:33,117 --> 00:18:35,101
It could provide
the access we need

395
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,586
to unearth the Initiative.

396
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,088
Well, that's great news.

397
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:40,740
Well, lemons to lemonade.
Oh.

398
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:44,811
B.T. Dubs, I was so sorry to hear about
your breakup with Remington Steele.

399
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,936
Though there really wasn't
enough room

400
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,707
- in your sidecar for both of us.
- Hello, Nolan.

401
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,706
Hey, buddy. Mm.

402
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:54,475
What? Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.

403
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,394
You two...

404
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:59,030
A fake up?

405
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:01,248
Color me impressed.

406
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,683
If I didn't know better,
I'd say

407
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:04,950
Daniel's already thinking...
Make up.

408
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:06,736
- That's the idea.
- For now.

409
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,732
I still think I can win back
Daniel's confidence.

410
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:10,691
Well, bros before hos
only works

411
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:13,227
if he's not still in love
with the ho, bro.

412
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:16,317
This has nothing to do
with love, Nolan.

413
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:17,831
I have an opportunity
to expose Judge Barnes

414
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:19,600
for his part
in my father's conviction.

415
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:23,406
If I have to play nice with Daniel
for a little while, then...

416
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,251
It's a small price to pay.

417
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:27,758
- I'll call you later.
- Yeah.

418
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:34,206
Hmm. Could get tricky.

419
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,758
If memory serves,
the line between...

420
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,886
Emily and Daniel
and the Initiative

421
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:42,105
has always been
decidedly blurred.

422
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:43,819
Then you do me a favor.

423
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:45,283
Help me stay
one step ahead of the boy.

424
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:47,352
Any information about
the Initiative you uncover,

425
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:50,037
in particular a woman
by the name of Helen Crowley,

426
00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:51,439
you let me know first.

427
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:54,843
Sure.

428
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:57,521
Greg, we're happy to be
a part of your success, right?

429
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:59,831
- And long may it continue.
- Hello, Daniel.

430
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,596
Oh, forgive me
for interrupting.

431
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:03,435
Interrupting is the least of your offenses.

432
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,704
- Greg, I'll call you back.
- It's time we mend fences.

433
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,240
And I've come to offer you
my services.

434
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:08,637
Your services aren't required.

435
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,187
But if I ever need advice
on betrayal,

436
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,925
I'll be sure
to give you a call...

437
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:13,137
After Dad.

438
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:16,109
Well, he does have
his considerable shortcomings.

439
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,425
But he did take this firm

440
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:18,659
from a budding hedge fund
to a pillar of Wall Street,

441
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:20,395
and he didn't do it alone.

442
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,382
Are you really patting yourself
on the back right now?

443
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:24,660
I'm simply giving credit
where credit's due.

444
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,844
Where do you think your father
brokered his biggest deals,

445
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:28,617
in this office

446
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,103
or over cocktails at polo matches
and galas that I hosted?

447
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:33,995
What are you offering to do, Mom,
throw me a party?

448
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:35,439
Well, there is
a dinner tonight.

449
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:38,114
And the next U.S. Supreme Court justice
will be in attendance.

450
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:41,414
And if you're serious about
your long-term success, so will you.

451
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:46,690
Oh. Um...

452
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:48,675
Emily Thorne just became
a major donor

453
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,494
for Patricia Barnes'
pet charity.

454
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,231
She'll be there as well,

455
00:20:54,265 --> 00:20:56,867
if that helps sway
your decision.

456
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:08,651
You trying to hack into
Grayson Global's intranet?

457
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:10,737
Not that it is
<i>any</i> of your business,

458
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,906
but I am following the orders
of my child boss...

459
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,208
your pal Daniel.

460
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:17,226
You really expect me to believe
that Grayson asked you

461
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:19,261
to hack into
his own company's files?

462
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:21,177
I don't really care
what you believe, Marco.

463
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:22,712
I am not the bad guy here.

464
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:25,614
But if you keep siding
with Daniel Grayson,

465
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:28,113
the only bad guy here is you.

466
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,955
Nolan, look, we have to stop
doing this to each other.

467
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:34,724
Let's go get some drinks.

468
00:21:34,747 --> 00:21:36,098
Sorry.

469
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:37,557
You had your chance.

470
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:41,875
Ahh. And I'm in.

471
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:45,709
Good night, Marco.

472
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:56,345
- Thank you.
- Good evening, Ms. Thorne.

473
00:21:56,363 --> 00:21:59,782
Emily, you look terrific
as always.

474
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:01,851
Thank you.

475
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:04,576
I hope this isn't too awkward.

476
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:06,842
Are you okay...

477
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:09,304
After what happened today
at lunch with you and Aiden?

478
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:11,661
Yeah.

479
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:13,408
Yeah. A-Aiden's a good guy.

480
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,231
He's smart. He's... driven.

481
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:18,951
But... I don't know.
Maybe he's just not for me.

482
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,030
Well, at least you found out
before it got too serious.

483
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:24,766
Luckily, the same can be said
for me and Ashley.

484
00:22:24,817 --> 00:22:28,920
Emily. Oh, you're just on time.
Come join us.

485
00:22:29,774 --> 00:22:31,590
Shall we?

486
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:37,662
I actually audited a torts class

487
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,781
when I was considering
law school as an undergrad

488
00:22:39,832 --> 00:22:42,401
back in... 2002.

489
00:22:43,008 --> 00:22:43,875
- Really?
- Mm.

490
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:45,393
I didn't know that.

491
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:47,295
Daniel, it seems
that your tendency

492
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:50,198
to overlook critical detail
is not just exclusive to business.

493
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:53,952
Mm. The occasional oversight is far
less damaging than willful ignorance.

494
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:56,652
Oh, enough, you two.
We have guests.

495
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,719
Oh, a little competition
between men is healthy, Victoria.

496
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:02,475
After all, it's the foundation
of our great nation, huh?

497
00:23:03,644 --> 00:23:05,161
That's what
my professor said.

498
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:07,780
In fact, Judge Barnes,
I believe you knew him.

499
00:23:07,831 --> 00:23:10,982
Um, James Palmer.

500
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,808
Yes.
Yes, of course I knew James.

501
00:23:12,831 --> 00:23:15,205
He was a clerk
in my court for a time.

502
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:19,158
Mm. His accident that winter
shook up the entire campus.

503
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:22,802
Well, he was a good man.

504
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,102
His passion for justice
was unparalleled.

505
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:29,450
Patricia, you knew him, too?

506
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,005
Only in legacy.

507
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:36,814
Which, if I'm not mistaken,

508
00:23:36,837 --> 00:23:39,880
includes the infamous
David Clarke trial.

509
00:23:39,903 --> 00:23:41,946
I own the man's house.

510
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,936
Conspiracy theorists show up
on my doorstep all the time.

511
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,636
To say nothing of
David's own daughter Amanda.

512
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,714
She and Emily have become
quite friendly lately.

513
00:23:49,765 --> 00:23:52,915
Well, no disrespect to your friend,
Ms. Thorne,

514
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:55,239
but when it comes to that
contemptible father of hers,

515
00:23:55,263 --> 00:23:57,522
believe me,
justice was well served.

516
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:02,785
Sounds like your certainty
gives you great comfort.

517
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:04,819
I haven't lost a night
of sleep over the man,

518
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,663
if that's what you're asking.

519
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:08,933
No, that would be my job.

520
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,604
But, Patricia,
surely the Liberty Project

521
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:21,737
has been approached
countless times about an appeal.

522
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:23,070
No.

523
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:24,964
Actually, it hasn't.

524
00:24:24,987 --> 00:24:27,303
None of my husband's verdicts
have ever been second-guessed

525
00:24:27,326 --> 00:24:29,357
by the organization.

526
00:24:31,415 --> 00:24:34,656
His opinions
are above reproach.

527
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,801
Hence
the Supreme Court nomination.

528
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:39,705
Hear, hear.

529
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,396
Victoria,

530
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:43,575
thank you
for the lovely dinner.

531
00:24:43,598 --> 00:24:46,092
But there's much work to be done
before tomorrow's benefit.

532
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:47,559
I'm coming down
with a bit of a headache.

533
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:50,294
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Should I have something sent to you?

534
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:51,738
Thank you.

535
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:54,441
I think I'll join you, darling.

536
00:24:54,464 --> 00:24:55,709
Good night, all.

537
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:58,318
Pleasure, Daniel, Ms. Thorne.

538
00:25:08,347 --> 00:25:10,913
Sorry for
dropping in on you like this.

539
00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:12,781
The Stowaway's been rowdy.

540
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,134
Carl hasn't been sleeping,
so I haven't been sleeping.

541
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:18,570
You can stay
as long as you need.

542
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:23,229
"Broken collar bone,
fractured wrist"?

543
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:25,683
Whose records are these?

544
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:27,429
Patricia Barnes.

545
00:25:27,497 --> 00:25:30,566
She's the wife of the judge
in my father's trial.

546
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:36,610
"Dear Mr. Clarke"...
Did she write this?

547
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:39,525
I'm beginning to wonder.

548
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:42,563
It says here,
she had a criminal record.

549
00:25:42,597 --> 00:25:45,619
Join the club.

550
00:25:45,642 --> 00:25:49,069
Her judgment was expunged,
just like mine.

551
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,972
There must be something here.

552
00:25:53,023 --> 00:25:55,390
Apartheid protest, 1988.

553
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:59,094
- Patricia was a badass.
- Maybe back then.

554
00:26:00,864 --> 00:26:02,064
Wait.

555
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:03,816
I don't believe this.

556
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,534
That's James Palmer
next to her.

557
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:07,019
Who?

558
00:26:07,054 --> 00:26:09,151
Barnes' court clerk.

559
00:26:09,174 --> 00:26:11,372
He and Patricia were friends.

560
00:26:11,407 --> 00:26:12,807
Which means,
if she did write the letter,

561
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:16,289
whoever killed Palmer
believed he wrote it, not her.

562
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:20,575
That would scare
anyone into silence.

563
00:26:20,598 --> 00:26:24,394
Especially if the threat
lives under the same roof.

564
00:26:24,428 --> 00:26:26,296
Well, since you've already
mastered the links, Grayson,

565
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,876
how do you plan to spend
the rest of your retirement?

566
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:31,012
Retirement is a long way off, Robert.

567
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:33,478
This is but a respite from
my stewardship of the company.

568
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:35,141
Well, it's just
one man's opinion,

569
00:26:35,164 --> 00:26:38,425
but I think a man of your acumen,
wealth, and guile belongs in politics.

570
00:26:38,476 --> 00:26:40,493
Oh, don't go putting ideas
in his head, Robert.

571
00:26:40,528 --> 00:26:43,237
It's the last thing
this family needs.

572
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:46,502
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have a speech to work on.

573
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:49,073
As do I.

574
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:52,484
And one without numbers,
spin, or projection.

575
00:26:52,508 --> 00:26:54,985
I could get very used to this.

576
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,436
Oh, God help us all.

577
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:05,511
So what were you able
to find out?

578
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:07,837
Oh... very little.

579
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,510
- Until I stumbled across this gem.
- What?

580
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:16,972
Conrad has his surveillance system
backed up and archived.

581
00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:19,791
This one's from
the investor's lunch.

582
00:27:20,894 --> 00:27:22,496
- Helen.
- Mm.

583
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,040
I enhanced the image...

584
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:29,363
And I figured out
the number she was calling.

585
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:31,782
- Is it still working?
- Well, sort of.

586
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:34,116
It's voice-activated access.

587
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,146
Problem is, Aiden,
I can't read lips.

588
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:38,991
I've tried everything from
"integrity" to "interpol"...

589
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:41,532
<i>Ingredi.</i>
She's saying <i>ingredi.</i>

590
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:43,658
- It's... it's Latin for...
- "Entry."

591
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:44,968
Very good.

592
00:27:53,468 --> 00:27:54,802
<i>Ingredi.</i>

593
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,697
<i>Mr. Mathis,
I presume?</i>

594
00:27:58,731 --> 00:27:59,881
Yes.

595
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,917
<i>I've been expecting your call.</i>

596
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:03,918
I think it's time we meet.

597
00:28:03,936 --> 00:28:05,954
I couldn't agree more.

598
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:12,143
This one is on the house, doll.

599
00:28:12,194 --> 00:28:14,663
Anything else you need,
you know who to come to.

600
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:18,672
Thought we were in this
to make money.

601
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,975
And we will when she brings in
all her good-looking friends, too.

602
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:23,443
Ladies and gentlemen,

603
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,962
we're closing The Stowaway
early this evening

604
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,647
by order of the Montauk P.D.

605
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:30,584
Put your drinks down, people,
and head for the exits.

606
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:32,035
That means you.

607
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:35,848
Drinks down!

608
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,796
You're in the deep end now,
Mr. Mathis.

609
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:49,232
- I hope you know how to swim.
- So it's true.

610
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:51,802
You're with the Initiative.

611
00:28:51,853 --> 00:28:53,520
You destroyed my family.

612
00:28:53,538 --> 00:28:55,288
Nothing personal.

613
00:28:55,306 --> 00:28:57,624
You realize I'm three moves
away from snapping your neck.

614
00:28:57,658 --> 00:28:58,975
Well, if you do that,

615
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,161
how will you ever
reunite with your sister?

616
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:05,987
- Colleen's dead.
- Actually, no.

617
00:29:06,021 --> 00:29:08,689
When you murdered her kidnapper
back in 2006,

618
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:13,294
we realized keeping her alive
might someday prove useful.

619
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:15,613
Seems someday is upon us.

620
00:29:15,647 --> 00:29:20,885
So tell me, where have you been
these last six years? Hmm?

621
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:24,615
Ah. Strong and silent.

622
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:26,983
Good for you.
Bad for Colleen.

623
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:28,151
Where is she, bitch?

624
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:31,505
One more step and it's all over.

625
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,173
Next time we meet,

626
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:36,326
you bring your manners,
and I'll bring an offer.

627
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:39,379
You mention this meeting
to anyone,

628
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,432
and you'll never see
your sister alive again.

629
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:44,885
Good-bye, Mr. Mathis.

630
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:54,751
Well, since it looks like
we're gonna be here a while,

631
00:29:54,774 --> 00:29:56,535
I'd be happy to grind up
some of those

632
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,731
fine columbian coffee beans
for you officers.

633
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,274
No narcotics here, Sergeant.

634
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:01,460
Dogs would've found it.

635
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:02,742
Check the slips.

636
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,993
Nolan, happy Thanksgiving.

637
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:11,912
What is all this?

638
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:16,216
Because of me, we never had
a chance to have this dinner.

639
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:17,851
And I...
I need you to understand...

640
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:21,527
No, Marco. You knew me.

641
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:23,823
Oh, yeah, you knew me
better than anyone else.

642
00:30:23,846 --> 00:30:26,793
Did you <i>really</i> think that I
would aid and abet a terrorist

643
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:30,896
or... or greedily keep
a young girl's inheritance, really?

644
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,033
I want a chance to start over.

645
00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:39,204
And there are
<i>so many</i> reasons why...

646
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:41,070
that's never gonna happen.

647
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:43,134
Not the least of which being,

648
00:30:43,158 --> 00:30:45,329
ha, I've fallen
for someone else.

649
00:30:45,352 --> 00:30:47,337
Then I will wait.

650
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,814
I'll wait as long as it takes.

651
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:58,467
What's this?

652
00:30:58,502 --> 00:31:01,070
This is the most powerful
piece of coding I've ever seen.

653
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:03,522
Wait. Carrion?

654
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:04,673
I found some reference docs

655
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,758
while I was cleaning up
the system files today...

656
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:08,951
No, no, no.
This program is cyber-plutonium.

657
00:31:08,975 --> 00:31:11,217
I abandoned that project
for a reason.

658
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:13,480
Maybe it's time you revisit it.

659
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:16,462
This could be the most important
R&D in the industry,

660
00:31:16,486 --> 00:31:19,562
a useful weapon
against your enemies,

661
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:21,935
or... in this case,
your parent company.

662
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:26,482
Look...

663
00:31:29,082 --> 00:31:31,817
Like I said...

664
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:33,966
I'm in your corner.

665
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:48,148
Well, I'm assuming
that Conrad's speech

666
00:31:48,182 --> 00:31:50,015
will be coming before yours.

667
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,107
Can we also assume

668
00:31:51,141 --> 00:31:52,658
that Patricia will be
introducing him?

669
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:54,911
Oh, I'm afraid my wife's
migraine has not subsided.

670
00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:57,346
She'd prefer to stay out
of the spotlight if she can.

671
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:00,917
Conrad will have the honor of
introducing himself tonight.

672
00:32:00,951 --> 00:32:02,852
Happily.

673
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,430
There you are.

674
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:10,481
Didn't think they'd let you in
after last night's sparring match.

675
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:13,512
Well, you'd be surprised
what people will put up with

676
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:15,881
when you agree to be
a platinum-level donor.

677
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:18,235
Speaking of,

678
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,371
I'm sorry things got
so intense at dinner.

679
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,539
Oh, don't be.

680
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:22,673
It was a nice reminder

681
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:25,126
how passionate
Emily Thorne can be.

682
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:32,192
I'm gonna go apologize.

683
00:32:35,343 --> 00:32:38,011
You love breakfast for dinner.
What's wrong?

684
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:42,065
Nothing. It's just gonna suck
when you burn this boat down.

685
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,984
You need to relax.

686
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:50,307
Freeze!

687
00:32:50,358 --> 00:32:51,775
Montauk police!

688
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:53,544
Declan, what's going on?

689
00:32:53,578 --> 00:32:55,112
Don't move!

690
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,534
Patricia.

691
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,138
I just wanted to apologize
for last night.

692
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:09,322
I didn't mean to...

693
00:33:09,345 --> 00:33:12,145
insult you or your husband.

694
00:33:12,168 --> 00:33:13,542
He seemed quite upset.

695
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:17,112
A man in his position learns to
keep his temper to himself.

696
00:33:17,135 --> 00:33:20,049
Last I checked,
migraines don't cause bruising.

697
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:29,039
Victoria mentioned that I'm close
with David Clarke's daughter Amanda.

698
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:36,950
After...

699
00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:39,402
she lost her father,
Amanda was...

700
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:42,217
forced into
the foster care system.

701
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:46,121
She ended up in a number
of abusive homes.

702
00:33:46,155 --> 00:33:50,325
That letter gave her the hope
she needed to survive.

703
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,810
The thing is,

704
00:33:51,844 --> 00:33:54,479
she thought it was written
by James Palmer.

705
00:33:55,682 --> 00:33:58,143
No, it wasn't.

706
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,997
He wouldn't
have left it unsigned.

707
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:05,034
He was brave.

708
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:11,674
That letter saved
Amanda's life.

709
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:15,522
Tonight you have the opportunity
to save a whole lot more.

710
00:34:17,692 --> 00:34:19,993
Maybe even your own.

711
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:34,791
We found narcotics
and a handgun hidden in the bilge.

712
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,726
Oh, my God.

713
00:34:38,737 --> 00:34:40,664
My brother gives you a pass.
This is how you repay him?

714
00:34:40,698 --> 00:34:43,750
What pass?
Declan, what's he talking about?

715
00:34:43,784 --> 00:34:46,173
The kid broke into my brother's
house a couple of months back.

716
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:48,783
We never said anything 'cause
Kenny figured he learned his lesson.

717
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:50,610
Obviously, he got it wrong.

718
00:34:50,626 --> 00:34:52,026
Declan Porter,
you're under arrest...

719
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,945
No, wait! Wait, wait.
Stop. It's mine.

720
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:55,013
- Jack.
- All of it.

721
00:34:55,064 --> 00:34:56,314
- Jack!
- The boat's in my name.

722
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:58,783
My brother had no idea
there were drugs hidden on it.

723
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:01,352
Then, Jack Porter,
you're under arrest

724
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:03,098
for possession
with intent to distribute

725
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:04,789
and possession of a firearm.

726
00:35:04,823 --> 00:35:06,386
You have the right
to remain silent.

727
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:08,426
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

728
00:35:08,444 --> 00:35:10,612
in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney...

729
00:35:10,663 --> 00:35:14,794
To be falsely accused
is a gut-ripping experience.

730
00:35:14,817 --> 00:35:16,776
And that's why I plan
to redouble my efforts

731
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,512
to help the wrongfully accused
by donating not only my finances

732
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,711
but my time
to the Liberty Project...

733
00:35:23,723 --> 00:35:25,449
With the hope

734
00:35:25,472 --> 00:35:28,032
that someday we may truly
live in a world

735
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:31,057
of liberty and justice for all.

736
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,427
Thank you, Conrad.

737
00:35:38,462 --> 00:35:41,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to introduce my wife...

738
00:35:41,783 --> 00:35:43,583
Patricia Barnes.

739
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:50,806
Thank you.

740
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,011
A man far wiser
and braver than I once said,

741
00:35:57,035 --> 00:36:00,082
"There may times when we are
powerless to prevent injustice,

742
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:03,018
but let there never be a time
when we fail to protest."

743
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:15,237
When I was in law school,
I met a man named James Palmer.

744
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,388
He was young and bright-eyed,

745
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,991
full of hope and integrity.

746
00:36:21,025 --> 00:36:23,444
Robert hired James
to be his court clerk

747
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:25,745
during the trial
of David Clarke.

748
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:30,631
For years after the trial...

749
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:32,632
James had wanted
to come forward

750
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:34,112
with information that,
at the very least,

751
00:36:34,135 --> 00:36:35,915
would've resulted
in a mistrial.

752
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,420
But out of concern for my safety,

753
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:41,837
he kept that dark secret hidden.

754
00:36:41,848 --> 00:36:45,175
Three days before his death...

755
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,757
That secret came out
in a letter

756
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:49,813
written to Mr. Clarke
in federal prison.

757
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,722
"Dear Mr. Clarke,

758
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:53,624
I'm afraid you have suffered
a grave injustice."

759
00:36:53,648 --> 00:36:55,421
Patricia.

760
00:36:55,432 --> 00:36:57,721
Robert.

761
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:08,252
"My position has provided me

762
00:37:08,275 --> 00:37:11,035
"unparalleled access
to the system.

763
00:37:11,058 --> 00:37:15,587
Judge Barnes has failed you,
Mr. Clarke, as have I."

764
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:17,513
You see, what James knew

765
00:37:17,548 --> 00:37:19,382
is what Judge Barnes knew,

766
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:21,150
which is that
the verdict rendered

767
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:24,087
in the David Clarke trial
came from a tainted jury.

768
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:29,532
I believe that this letter
cost James the ultimate price.

769
00:37:29,544 --> 00:37:32,268
But James didn't write it.

770
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,913
I did.

771
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:39,968
And today my husband,
Robert Barnes,

772
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:43,489
stands to inherit
a great deal more power.

773
00:37:44,546 --> 00:37:46,483
And...

774
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:47,994
The greater the power,

775
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:51,214
the greater the potential
for abuse.

776
00:38:16,182 --> 00:38:17,959
My wife and I are shocked

777
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:20,857
to learn the true nature of a man
we all thought we knew,

778
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:25,188
and I pledge to pool my resources
to ensure Judge Barnes' wrongdoings,

779
00:38:25,212 --> 00:38:28,206
both judicial and domestic,
are avenged.

780
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:29,512
Rest assured,

781
00:38:29,546 --> 00:38:31,514
justice will be served.

782
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:33,266
Thank you.

783
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:36,035
Hello.

784
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,632
<i>Hello, Daniel.</i>

785
00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:40,884
<i>I saw you and your family
had another interesting public evening.</i>

786
00:38:40,909 --> 00:38:42,577
Well, except this time,

787
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:45,360
the press may actually work
in my father's favor.

788
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,797
How are you faring in your hunt

789
00:38:46,832 --> 00:38:48,382
for those
elusive Grayson assets?

790
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:49,917
<i>If I didn't know better,</i>

791
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:52,303
I'd say you sent me
on a wild goose chase.

792
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:54,121
You turned to Nolan Ross
for his assistance,

793
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:55,539
<i>am I correct?</i>

794
00:38:56,855 --> 00:38:58,158
Yeah.

795
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:01,634
<i>In doing so, Mr. Ross left a trail
of digital breadcrumbs,</i>

796
00:39:01,657 --> 00:39:03,402
<i>a trail your I.T. department</i>

797
00:39:03,436 --> 00:39:07,890
will be able to follow right back
to Nolcorp and its secrets.

798
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:13,025
<i>One in particular,
I think you'll find very lucrative.</i>

799
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,361
I'm listening.

800
00:39:20,002 --> 00:39:23,456
- Charlotte get home all right?
- Yeah.

801
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:25,765
Yeah, not without a lot
of explanation, though.

802
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,667
She deserves it
after a night like this...

803
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:30,320
Your boat impounded,
your brother arrested.

804
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:33,073
Jack's a good guy, taking the fall.

805
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:35,058
Kenny, you know
that wasn't our stuff.

806
00:39:37,798 --> 00:39:40,259
I'm sorry for what happened.

807
00:39:40,282 --> 00:39:42,367
Truly.

808
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,372
Hey, whoever called the cops today
made a huge mistake.

809
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:51,324
I just hope that they come to their senses,
or things might get worse around here.

810
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:53,567
A lot worse.

811
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,117
Kenny, you coming?

812
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:00,232
Oh, uh, Declan, be a pal, huh?

813
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:02,017
Clean up a little bit.

814
00:40:08,554 --> 00:40:09,904
<i>Hello.</i>

815
00:40:09,938 --> 00:40:13,146
- Amanda. Uh, hey, it's me.
- Jack, you okay? What happened?

816
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:17,161
The police found drugs and a gun
on the <i>Amanda</i>.

817
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:18,296
<i>I'm in jail.</i>

818
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,663
Jack, oh, my God.

819
00:40:19,681 --> 00:40:21,765
<i>Don't... don't worry.
I don't want you to worry.</i>

820
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:23,384
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

821
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,008
- I gotta go.
- Time's up, man.

822
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:34,462
- I love you.
- Come on. Let's go.

823
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:45,635
<i>Power can be hoarded
by the mighty</i>

824
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:49,128
<i>or stolen from the innocent.</i>

825
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:51,113
Ems,
I'm gonna take a shower.

826
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,865
Okay.

827
00:40:57,742 --> 00:41:01,645
<i>Power provides
the ability to choose...</i>

828
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:11,822
<i>But has a proclivity
for corruption.</i>

829
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:15,113
Daniel.

830
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,149
Hey. Do you have a second?

831
00:41:17,862 --> 00:41:19,434
Yeah.

832
00:41:19,485 --> 00:41:22,821
Sorry to stop by unannounced.

833
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:24,556
Is everything okay?

834
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,992
Yeah. I just...
I tried to tell you this earlier,

835
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,727
but of course
my mother interrupted.

836
00:41:28,761 --> 00:41:31,897
It's what she does.

837
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:33,165
I wanted you to know,

838
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,050
the reason I fought so hard
to become C.E.O.

839
00:41:35,084 --> 00:41:37,669
was to set things right.

840
00:41:38,407 --> 00:41:40,258
You see, the only thing larger

841
00:41:40,293 --> 00:41:42,679
than our company's
image problem

842
00:41:42,694 --> 00:41:45,362
is our charitable foundation.

843
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:48,365
Emily, you're the most
philanthropic person I know,

844
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:50,067
and I could really use
your help

845
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:52,853
steering our resources
in that direction.

846
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:56,093
- Well, I'm flattered, but...
- You don't have to answer now.

847
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:58,733
Just tell me
you'll think about it.

848
00:42:07,315 --> 00:42:08,465
Daniel.

849
00:42:10,316 --> 00:42:14,026
I don't need to think about it.

850
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:17,191
My answer's "yes."

851
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:27,735
<i>The use of power is not
to be taken lightly...</i>

852
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:34,992
<i>For it is never
without consequence.</i>
