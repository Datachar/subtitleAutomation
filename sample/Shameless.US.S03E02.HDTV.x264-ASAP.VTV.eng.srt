Nice to switch back.

00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,186
Thought you had
four more months.

362
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,157
Yeah, let me out
for overcrowding or some shit.

What, they don't
have booze over there?

383
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,737

More than this.

390

There's gonna be at least
200 people there, babe.

the booze from them?

For well drinks,
you'd probably get away with 3.

Would he let me set up
an account and invoice me later?

00:53:06,335 --> 00:53:07,935
you should hold onto it, right?

1236
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:10,905
[Scoffs] I was trying
to better our situation, Lip.

1237
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:12,607
Oh, congratulations.

1238
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:15,209
You risked everything,
and you didn't even break even.

1239
00:53:15,243 --> 00:53:17,878
It was my first time
doing this.

1240
00:53:17,913 --> 00:53:19,580
That's not the point.

1241
00:53:19,615 --> 00:53:21,916
You made a decision without
consulting the rest of us.

1242
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,051
- I'm in charge of this family.
- Really?

1243
00:53:24,086 --> 00:53:26,587
No, I'm sorry, that's--
that's news to me.

1244
00:53:26,622 --> 00:53:30,558
You see, Fiona, if we're gonna
be every man for himself,

1245
00:53:30,592 --> 00:53:32,893
this family
is going under fast.

1246
00:53:32,928 --> 00:53:35,429
Here,
just take the money, okay?

1247
00:53:35,464 --> 00:53:38,265
Pay the property tax. I'll get
the rest tomorrow somehow.

1248
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,668
No, I don't need it.

1249
00:53:40,702 --> 00:53:42,103
What?

1250
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:44,238
I took care
of the situation myself.

1251
00:53:44,272 --> 00:53:47,141
How?

1252
00:53:47,175 --> 00:53:49,310
Told a bunch of North Side kids

1253
00:53:49,344 --> 00:53:50,745
that Wilco was playing
at your party.

1254
00:53:50,779 --> 00:53:52,747
It's like I said.

1255
00:53:52,781 --> 00:53:55,950
The only way to make money
when you're poor

1256
00:53:55,984 --> 00:53:58,119
is to steal it or scam it.

1257
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:00,921
But hey, um, let me know if
the rules are changing, right,

1258
00:54:00,956 --> 00:54:03,157
and you're gonna pull
this shit again?

1259
00:54:03,191 --> 00:54:07,862
Maybe I'll have to take
over the family money, huh?

1260
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:24,779
[Rock music]

1261
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:27,615
?

1262
00:54:32,688 --> 00:54:34,955
Are we sure about this?

1263
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:38,959
He raised six great kids.

1264
00:54:38,994 --> 00:54:40,728
Look at him.

1265
00:54:40,762 --> 00:54:43,030
He's like the baby whisperer.

1266
00:54:43,065 --> 00:54:49,181
?

1267
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,971
