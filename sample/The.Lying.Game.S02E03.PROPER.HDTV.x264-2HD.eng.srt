00:00:01,843 --> 00:00:03,244
<i>EMMA: A few months ago, I
discovered I had a twin sister.</i>

2
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:05,146
<i>And then she she asked
me to take her place,</i>

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,381
<i>keep the secret, find our real mother</i>

4
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:09,417
<i>and try to stay alive.</i>

5
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,119
<i>Put yourself in my shoes.</i>

6
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:14,922
<i>How long could you keep up the lying game?</i>

7
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:16,323
JESSICA: All I had to
do was get a tire iron

8
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:18,125
and drop it into Mr. Rybak's bag.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,960
Frame himself for murder?

10
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:21,061
Why would he do that?

11
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:22,096
To throw us off.

12
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,664
I knew Dad was innocent.

13
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:24,698
And you never listened

14
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,966
because he's not your real father.

15
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,735
What will it take to make this right?

16
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:29,603
And if you were to promise me right now

17
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:30,805
that you have told me everything.

18
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,741
I swear you know everything.

19
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:34,775
I want you to work things out with Kristin.

20
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,610
And I'd like to be there for you.

21
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,345
<i>MADS: I hooked up with Jordan.</i>

22
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,247
Now, it turns out he's my new stepbrother.

23
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:41,415
You should really think about going solo.

24
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,284
It looks really good on you.

25
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:44,585
<i>EMMA: Thayer has always been there for me.</i>

26
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:47,488
You and Sutton are perfect for each other.

27
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:49,156
So, it's cool if Ethan and I give in

28
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:51,025
to the chemistry between us? Yeah.

29
00:00:54,296 --> 00:00:55,329
What took you so long?

30
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,543
* You could say

31
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:12,847
* All love breaks you

32
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:17,685
* Every kiss who you are

33
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:24,325
* If I could tell you

34
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,562
* What I've been thinking

35
00:01:28,597 --> 00:01:29,530
* Baby...

36
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:37,972
Aw, crap.

37
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:41,141
Morning, sleepyhead.

38
00:01:41,176 --> 00:01:44,078
(groans) God, what did I do?

39
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:45,846
Me.

40
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:47,014
Several times, actually.

41
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:49,783
Don't you remember?

42
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,987
I was really drunk.

43
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:54,755
Ow, I wasn't thinking.

44
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,958
Um, we've both know we've been thinking

45
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,660
about doing that for a while now.

46
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:00,895
It was only a matter of time.

47
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:02,796
I never should've come here.

48
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,832
What are you doing? I thought
we'd spend the day together.

49
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:06,834
I've got school.

50
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:10,304
Well, you had a good time
last night though, didn't you?

51
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,473
That's not the point, okay?

52
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,408
It was a mistake, Sutton.

53
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:18,412
Can I have my shirt back?

54
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,287
This is because of Emma, isn't it?

55
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:28,923
I'm... I'm just really sorry
about the whole thing, okay?

56
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:30,991
Well, you didn't seem to
be too sorry last night.

57
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,294
I... I know... y... you're right.

58
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:36,897
You're right and that
just was not fair to you.

59
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:39,066
I realize that and, um...

60
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,801
I promise it won't happen again.

61
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,754
* Uh, uh-uh

62
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:03,023
* Uh, uh-uh-uh, uh

63
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,693
* Watch out for this girl

64
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,795
* She's got a gun for a tongue. *

66
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:11,799
You really shouldn't have
left the party so early.

67
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,901
You still had guests to entertain.

68
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:15,035
Like Laurel Mercer?

69
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,972
Admit it: she's just a way for
you to get closer to her dad.

70
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:20,674
Maybe, but I'd play along if I were you.

71
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:21,909
'Cause it be a real shame

72
00:03:21,943 --> 00:03:24,078
if some of your past mistakes
were to come to light.

73
00:03:24,112 --> 00:03:25,713
Wouldn't it?

74
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,617
You know what?

75
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,751
We can talk about this later.

76
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:31,919
'Cause you're late for school.

77
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:34,021
I hate it when you get parental on me.

78
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,761
Sutton?

79
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:42,763
How many times do I have to tell you?

80
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:44,865
I'm sorry, but this is an emergency.

81
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:47,735
I slept with Ethan.

82
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,737
That's not an emergency.

83
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,938
Unless, of course,

84
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:52,806
you didn't use protection?

85
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,775
No, I did.

86
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:58,746
He... he freaked out this morning.

87
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,781
And told me that he
wished it didn't happen.

88
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:02,683
I'm so sorry, Sutton.

89
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:03,817
Boys can be so cruel.

90
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,753
This is her fault.

91
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,822
If I could just get rid of Emma,
Ethan will forget about her.

92
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:10,591
She's your sister.

93
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,759
Someday we're going to be a family again.

94
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,661
And you need to get along with her.

95
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:15,729
He's holding out hope for her.

96
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:17,765
Just like your father.

97
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,001
Holding out hope for Kristin.

98
00:04:21,036 --> 00:04:25,739
Amazing how you can make
my problems all about you.

99
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:27,775
The truth is, you could
learn by my example.

100
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,077
Ted and I kind of had a moment last night.

101
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:32,613
Yay for you.

102
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:36,617
Yay for you too.

103
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,086
If you follow my lead.

104
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,024
I don't give up so easily,
and neither should you.

105
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:57,838
All right, thanks for the ride, man.

106
00:04:57,872 --> 00:04:59,773
Where the hell you been all night?

107
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:01,942
(sighs) Screwing up like usual.

108
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:03,610
You know?

109
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:05,746
I had to hitch a ride.

110
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,648
You're damn right you screwed up.

111
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,682
Your teacher called.

112
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:10,651
Mr. Beattie?

113
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,720
You plagiarize a paper?

114
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:15,756
Sounds like you already
know the answer to that.

115
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,790
Yeah, he ran it through some software.

116
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:18,025
Found out it was bought online.

117
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,993
Dan, I know I shouldn't
have done that, okay?

118
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,662
Save it, Ethan.

119
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,564
I can't let you go back to juvie.

120
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:25,566
So I got Beattie to
give you a second chance.

121
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,768
You're going to take an
exam on all the coursework.

122
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:31,472
It's real simple: you pass
the test, you pass the course.

123
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:34,241
Okay, thanks.

124
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,375
When is the test?

125
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,477
Tomorrow morning.

126
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:38,278
It's tomorrow morning?

127
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:40,214
How am I going to pass
a test tomorrow morning?

128
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,381
I don't know, but you better figure it out

129
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,896
because your whole life depends on it.

130
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:49,923
What happened to your eye?

131
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,959
I'm just making friends.

132
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,928
Everybody in jail loves the D.A.

133
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:55,863
Let me get this straight.

134
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,633
Dan, our Dan,

135
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:02,770
came up with this crazy theory
that I'm trying to frame myself?

136
00:06:02,804 --> 00:06:04,838
You know it makes more
sense than your own theory.

137
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:06,440
After all, it was a man

138
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:07,808
who called the waitress to set you up.

139
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:09,376
Rebecca could've done that.

140
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,444
She could've hired someone.

141
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,580
Or... you made the call yourself.

142
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:16,150
I thought you were trying
to represent me here.

143
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:17,317
The objective was to get me out of jail.

144
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:19,086
Whose side are you on?

145
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,021
When you hired me, you told me

146
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:23,123
that if you could convince
me of your innocence,

147
00:06:23,158 --> 00:06:25,025
you could convince a jury too. Well...

148
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:28,262
I'm not as convinced as I used to be.

149
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:32,766
Pull the waitress's phone records.

150
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,636
That'll prove I didn't make the call.

151
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,805
Dan's already on it.

152
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,606
Should have them this afternoon.

153
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:42,609
You know, Theresa, you really ought

154
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:43,811
to keep your eye on the ball.

155
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:48,415
Rebecca's pulling the strings on this one.

156
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,652
Not me.

157
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:53,320
I heard the strange ringtone

158
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:56,456
and I found this hidden in the garage.

159
00:06:56,491 --> 00:06:58,992
- A cell phone?
- Yeah.

160
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,195
I thought the police already
searched your whole house.

161
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,189
Well, I know, it's weird
that they didn't find it,

162
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:05,899
but it's got to be my dad's,
so I have to turn it in.

163
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:08,168
No, hold on, we need to check
it and see who he called.

164
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:09,269
I already did.

165
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,938
All incoming calls were blocked.

166
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,973
And if he made any calls
out, he cleared the log.

167
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:15,742
Can't you hack into it
and see what he deleted?

168
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:18,078
But that might be considered
tampering with evidence.

169
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:19,980
Thayer, this is going to be our only way

170
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:21,982
we're gonna know what he's
been up to all this time.

171
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:22,950
Please?

172
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,685
Can you just try?

173
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:27,421
Okay.

174
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:28,856
Thank you.

175
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,358
You're welcome.

176
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:34,528
(sighs)

177
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:35,796
Aren't they adorable?

178
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,365
I can't believe they finally got together.

179
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:40,534
She's coming.

180
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:41,602
Uh, act natural.

181
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,341
Oh, hi.

182
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,343
- Hey, how's everything?
- Hey.

183
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:52,312
Everything is fine.

184
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,447
Were you spying on me?

185
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:55,249
Us?

186
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:57,317
No.

187
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,219
Just came in here to brush my hair.

188
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:00,888
With my brush?

189
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:02,856
Okay, we were totally spying.

190
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:03,891
Oh, my God.

191
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:06,727
You and Thayer... this is awesome.

192
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:09,730
Way to hold firm, Laurel.

193
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:12,032
Mads, you should've come
out and talked to him.

194
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:13,734
Especially after what happened last night.

195
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,637
Well, his lips seemed pretty busy just now.

196
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:18,538
So, I figured I'd do it later.

197
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:19,873
Okay, listen, not to
make this all about me,

198
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:22,442
but I need to ask you guys a question.

199
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:26,580
What do you think about
me asking Jordan out?

200
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:32,419
Okay...

201
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:33,387
terrible idea.

202
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:35,455
No...

203
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,324
How well do you know him?

204
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:39,059
What? You think he's out of my league?

205
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:41,161
No, of course not.

206
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:42,095
I just think that...

207
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,363
I think you guys'd be great together.

208
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,198
You should totally go
for it. No reason not to.

209
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,968
(woman shrieks)

210
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:50,203
KRISTIN: This is disgusting!

211
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,972
What is this?

212
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:53,674
God!

213
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,808
- What's going on?
- Are you okay?

214
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:56,777
Well, the sink is clogged.

215
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:59,746
Ew, well, maybe Dad could fix it.

216
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:01,882
No, I don't want to have
to rely on him right now.

217
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,583
I can take care of this myself.

218
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:04,918
But I thought therapy went well.

219
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:07,554
That doesn't mean we are
getting back together.

220
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,656
Have you tried the disposal?

221
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:10,824
Maybe that'll clear it?

222
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:12,559
That is a very good idea.

223
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,627
You see, girls?

224
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:14,821
We can handle this ourselves.

225
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:17,698
(Kristin screams)

226
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:20,267
(girls laughing) (disposal grinding)

227
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:21,201
Oh, my God.

228
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:25,305
(disposal stops)

229
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,374
Um, I'll call a plumber.

230
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,247
(school bell rings)

231
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,217
Dude.

232
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:40,253
You and Sutton Mercer
back together again, huh?

233
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,289
Look, I might've seen her when
I dropped you at the cabin.

234
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:43,483
I mean, that girl moves fast.

235
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:44,992
Nothing happened, okay?

236
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,126
No, like literally fast.

237
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,260
Like The Flash.

238
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,996
You know, she was at the party one minute,

239
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,130
then the cabin the next.

240
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:52,366
She must've taken a shortcut.

241
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,936
So, she races down there
for a secret rendezvous,

242
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,337
and you guys don't even hook up?

243
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,339
Come on, you don't really expect
me to believe that, do you?

244
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:01,141
Jordan, you need to keep your mouth shut.

245
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:02,976
All right?

246
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:04,077
You didn't see anything.

247
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:05,078
Got it?

248
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:07,080
Got it.

249
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:10,851
She wasn't there.

250
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:13,787
And she's definitely
not down the hall either.

251
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:22,996
Ladies.

252
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,502
He was totally checking you out.

253
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:29,903
Ew, he's my stepbrother.

254
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,538
Regardless, you have to tell Laurel

255
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:32,606
that you hooked up with him.

256
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,740
You heard her this morning.

257
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:35,509
She was talking about asking him out.

258
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:37,411
It was a meaningless one-time thing,

259
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:39,479
and we've agreed never
to speak about it again.

260
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,547
It's like it didn't even happen.

261
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:42,349
But it did happen.

262
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:44,551
I'm late for Bio.

263
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:51,191
Cleaning out?

264
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:53,193
Dropping out, actually.

265
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:56,196
Beattie found out I plagiarized
that World Civ paper.

266
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,032
So, now I'm history.

267
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,868
Not that it's any your business.

268
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:03,036
Well, won't you go back to juvie.

269
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:04,838
Well, maybe that's where I belong.

270
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,908
No, Ethan, there has to
be something you can do.

271
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:09,509
ETHAN: Yeah, there's a test I'd have

272
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,546
to pass tomorrow on
all the course material,

273
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,648
but I can't do that
because I'm too far behind,

274
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:16,322
which is why I cheated in the first place.

275
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:18,852
Wait.

276
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,554
What?

277
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:22,756
I'll tutor you.

278
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,759
Why do you even care?

279
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:28,228
After everything I did.

280
00:11:28,262 --> 00:11:29,463
Aren't you with Thayer now?

281
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:31,565
Oh, come on. This has
nothing to do with him.

282
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,366
This is about your future.

283
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,534
You can't just give up.

284
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,304
Please, just let me help you.

285
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:52,969
Whoa, oops.

286
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:56,973
Excuse me.

287
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,308
Let me help.

288
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,377
Oh, my gosh, I'm such a klutz.

289
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:02,879
Maybe they should put warning
labels on these things.

290
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:04,281
(laughs) You're hilarious.

291
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:05,949
Um, hey, look,

292
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:08,885
I know this is really short notice, um,

293
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,721
but DJ Beat Baron is
spinning tonight at Hangar 19.

294
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:13,957
And I was thinking of going.

295
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:15,725
Would you want to come?

296
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,827
I didn't even know that
Beat Baron was in town.

297
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,596
His mixes are so sick.

298
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,930
So, you in?

299
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:22,799
Yeah, for sure.

300
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,801
Um, pick up around 7:00?

301
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:25,902
It's a date.

302
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:27,637
I mean, a date in the calendar

303
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:29,673
sense of the word. Right.

304
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,674
All right, I'll see you then.

305
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,641
Okay.

306
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:35,512
Woo.

307
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:39,683
Mads, I thought you said
you wanted to apologize.

308
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,718
I am apologizing.

309
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:44,287
For last night, but not
for thinking Dad's innocent.

310
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:45,288
I told you, he said...

311
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:46,523
I don't care what he said.

312
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,059
He's playing you just
like he plays everyone.

313
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:51,394
REBECCA: Guys?

314
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,129
Everything okay?

315
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:54,297
Yeah, fine.

316
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:55,932
No, it's not fine.

317
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:58,001
Rebecca, tell him about the fingerprint

318
00:12:58,035 --> 00:12:59,169
they found on the golf bag.

319
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:00,837
They can prove that Dad's been set up,

320
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:02,138
just like he's been saying all along.

321
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:04,708
Well, I didn't want to
get anybody's hopes up,

322
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,744
but things are looking a lot better now.

323
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:09,879
Well, I wouldn't pop
that champagne just yet.

324
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,681
Excuse me, guys. I have work to do.

325
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:13,416
Wait. We weren't finished talking.

326
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:14,551
Thayer, stay.

327
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,752
Why don't we all go to dinner together?

328
00:13:15,786 --> 00:13:17,354
My treat.

329
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:18,488
Sutton and I are playing tennis tonight.

330
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:21,257
She has regionals coming up. Sorry.

331
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:24,594
He just won't listen.

332
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:26,229
Oh, he'll come around.

333
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,331
Mads, it's you

334
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,266
that I'm actually worried about.

335
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,268
Between all of this,
your dad being in jail,

336
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:35,138
living at the Mercers while
they're going through divorce.

337
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:37,273
Well, Ted and Kristin are
actually in therapy now.

338
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:38,908
So, things seem better.

339
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,076
Really?

340
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,811
Yeah.

341
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:43,947
That's so good to hear.

342
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,652
KRISTIN: Oh, good, you made it.

343
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:50,987
I didn't think you would get here so...

344
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:52,789
Wait a second.

345
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:55,859
I told the girls
specifically not to call you.

346
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:57,761
Really? 'Cause Laurel made it sound

347
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,596
like you were practically
begging me to come over.

348
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,631
Did they clog the drain too?

349
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:03,400
Wouldn't put it past them... our girls.

350
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:04,667
Pretty crafty.

351
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:06,469
Aww, what is this?

352
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:08,505
Lamb chops, some kind of fish, chicken.

353
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:09,506
What are you thinking, piccata?

354
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,474
Parmigiana.

355
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:13,443
Mmm.

356
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,012
Kill for a home-cooked meal,
not that I'm hinting at anything.

357
00:14:16,046 --> 00:14:17,280
Don't you think it's a
little early for that?

358
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,182
Right.

359
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:21,050
Speaking of which, I spoke
to Dr. Sandy's office.

360
00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:23,920
She said she has a time
for us Monday at 10:00?

361
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:26,189
I actually have another
appointment at that time.

362
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:28,024
And I'm not...

363
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:29,893
I'm not sure that I
want to cancel it, so...

364
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:31,027
No pressure, that's fine.

365
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,996
Just let me know.

366
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,843
I have to rent a rooter for this,

367
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:36,533
- so can you wait till tomorrow?
- Sure.

368
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:41,604
The call to Jessica Whitman
was made from a burner cell,

369
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,540
so chances are it's been destroyed by now.

370
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:46,743
In other words, anyone could've
called her, including Alec.

371
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:48,278
Which is why I called his secretary

372
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:50,280
to check his schedule that day.

373
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:52,449
And from that look, I'm
guessing you found something.

374
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:54,417
He took off early.

375
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:57,487
Was gone all afternoon. Didn't say where.

376
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,222
Huh, suspicious.

377
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:01,157
Yeah, huh.

378
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:03,119
<i>EMMA: I'm so sorry. I have to</i>

379
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:04,921
bail on you for tennis. Something came up.

380
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:06,256
Well, whatever it is, it should wait

381
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,059
because I found out who my dad
called with that cell phone.

382
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:13,163
Apparently, he made one
call to a Jessica Whitman.

383
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:15,765
Number's been disconnected, but
I figured we could work together

384
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,933
and try and find her.

385
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,803
I can't tonight.

386
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,705
But...

387
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:22,906
but you can do it without me.

388
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,542
I'll call you later, okay?

389
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,379
ETHAN: Wait, they're getting along now?

390
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:30,714
I thought they hated each other.

391
00:15:30,748 --> 00:15:33,616
That was during the Seven Years' War.

392
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:36,619
After World War I, France
and England were allies.

393
00:15:36,654 --> 00:15:38,421
Well, how am I supposed
to keep this stuff straight

394
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:40,390
if even they can't decide who likes who?

395
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:42,392
This is worse than high school.

396
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:46,096
Maybe if you just focus
and put the ball down.

397
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:49,199
I am focused.

398
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:50,834
I really am.

399
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,736
But I am focusing on how this is going

400
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,738
to be a huge waste of my time.

401
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:56,840
You're right.

402
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,708
I can't teach you if
you don't want to learn.

403
00:15:58,743 --> 00:16:00,844
So have fun in juvie.

404
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:04,547
All right, wait, wait.
Hang on a second, okay?

405
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:07,884
I just feel like I don't deserve this.

406
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:09,619
What?

407
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:11,788
Your help.

408
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:15,291
(sighs)

409
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:17,260
Okay.

410
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:19,195
You made a mistake, Ethan.

411
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,234
And now you have a chance to make it right.

412
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:28,304
Ethan, I believe in you.

413
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,075
(sighs)

414
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:34,844
Emma, I have to tell you something.

415
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,148
I...

416
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:49,459
Well, hope I'm not interrupting anything.

417
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:50,760
Sutton, are you crazy?

418
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:52,395
Oh, would you relax?

419
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,563
I checked to make sure
Dan was still at work.

420
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:58,234
I was stopping by to see if Ethan
wanted to join me for dinner,

421
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:02,305
but, apparently, he has plans.

422
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,406
It's not what you think, all right?

423
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:05,108
I've... I've got a test tomorrow.

424
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:06,509
We're... we're studying. She's helping me.

425
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:09,245
Oh, well, that's really sweet.

426
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,980
I approve.

427
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:12,348
Seriously?

428
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:13,917
Yes, seriously, we don't want lover boy

429
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,252
to end up back in juvie now, do we?

430
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,854
EMMA: Lover boy?

431
00:17:17,888 --> 00:17:19,155
Oh, come on. It's a figure of speech.

432
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,857
We really have a lot
of work to do right now.

433
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:24,727
Okay, well, then I will leave you these.

434
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:25,895
Just for a little snack.

435
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,597
For later.

436
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:28,832
It's from that favorite
barbeque place you like.

437
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:32,435
Good luck tomorrow.

438
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,770
He doesn't need luck.

439
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,407
He has me.

440
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,680
You should have seen her.

441
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:45,827
Playing all innocent.

442
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:48,664
I'm telling you that if
I would have stayed there,

443
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:50,618
Alec wouldn't be the only
one in jail for murder.

444
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:51,566
You're going to be a lot happier

445
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:52,768
after you hear what I have to say.

446
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,770
What could you possibly say
that would make me feel better?

447
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:58,340
I want you...

448
00:17:58,374 --> 00:18:00,542
to take your life back from Emma.

449
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:03,545
Since when is switching back
ever been part of the plan?

450
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:05,414
It's just there's only so much I can do

451
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:07,115
to keep Ted and Kristin apart.

452
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,119
So, you want me to work from
the inside to split them up?

453
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:13,221
Well, think about it this way:

454
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:15,190
Emma will be here in isolation,

455
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,259
while you're out and about,

456
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:20,028
which means you'll have
Ethan all to yourself.

457
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:22,798
You know she's not going
to do this willingly

458
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:25,667
Mmm, you're going to have to
find a way to persuade her.

459
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:27,703
Don't let me down, pumpkin.

460
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:33,542
(doorbell rings)

461
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:34,843
Mads.

462
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:36,511
Hi.

463
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:38,347
Am I at the right house?

464
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:40,349
Yeah, I'm just staying
here for a little bit.

465
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:41,450
Come on in.

466
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:43,652
Laurel, uh, should be ready in a minute.

467
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:47,189
Sorry, I didn't realize you'd be here.

468
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:48,323
Guess this is kind of awkward.

469
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,325
Why would it be awkward?

470
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,095
Gotcha.

471
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:55,364
All set. Thanks for entertaining him.

472
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:57,199
Yeah, not a problem. You two have fun.

473
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,334
Hey, do you want to come?

474
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:00,335
Uh, I can't.

475
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,037
I don't want to impose.

476
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:03,939
Are you kidding? We're just hanging out.

477
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:05,907
Mm-hmm.

478
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:06,942
But I thought...

479
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:08,744
No, you should come.

480
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:10,946
It's not like it's a date or anything.

481
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:16,651
Jordan, can you give us a sec?

482
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:17,919
Okay, now you have to come with us.

483
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:19,988
No, I'm so not in the mood.

484
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:21,656
You were the one who
told me to ask him out,

485
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:23,625
and now I'm totally confused.

486
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:25,560
If you come along, you
can help me figure out

487
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:26,895
whether or not he's really into me or not.

488
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:28,797
(sighs)

489
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:29,831
Please?

490
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:33,769
Fine.

491
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:35,604
- For the record...
- Let's roll.

492
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:41,410
Not a word.

493
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:47,416
You left work early the day

494
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,251
that call to Jessica Whitman was made.

495
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:51,186
The only thing I'm guilty of is

496
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,221
leaving work early to play some golf.

497
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:55,090
And before you say anything,

498
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:57,125
you're not allowed to have cell
phones on the golf course, okay?

499
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,193
We should get out next week.

500
00:19:58,227 --> 00:19:59,394
What do you say? You free?

501
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:02,197
She is. You aren't.

502
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:04,966
Oh, think again, Danny Boy.

503
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,935
I've got a witness that'll back me up.

504
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:12,007
You two just gave me a
get-out-of-jail-free card.

505
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:23,652
(door opens)

506
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:24,559
Hey, sis.

507
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:25,894
You were out late.

508
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:28,530
Oh, you scared the crap out of me, Sutton.

509
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:29,631
Hey, you know, you should really get

510
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:30,632
these re-strung every now and then.

511
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,633
What do you think you're doing?

512
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,402
You can't go play tennis.

513
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:35,203
You're supposed to be staying out of sight.

514
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:36,571
And you're supposed to be
practicing for regionals,

515
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:38,473
but that doesn't seem to stop you

516
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:41,043
from going over to
Ethan's and tutoring him.

517
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:43,345
I knew you were upset about that.

518
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:45,047
Oh, I'm not upset.

519
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:46,281
I'm thrilled that you're helping him.

520
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:47,949
Mm-hmm.

521
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:49,751
I just don't want to lose regionals either.

522
00:20:49,786 --> 00:20:50,719
You know, a lot is riding on it:

523
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:51,987
a chance to play D-1 tennis,

524
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:53,789
and scholarship.

525
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:55,090
Since when has any of that mattered to you?

526
00:20:55,124 --> 00:20:56,958
Since I had a lot of time
to think up at that cabin.

527
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:58,760
And the fact of the matter
is, you and I are both going

528
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:00,629
to have to go to college someday.

529
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:03,565
Well, don't worry. I'm
ready for the tournament.

530
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,467
And I'm gonna win the scholarship.

531
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:09,438
Yeah, but a little bit
of practice wouldn't hurt.

532
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:12,607
So, I was thinking, I can
just give you some pointers.

533
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:13,708
We go out tomorrow.

534
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:15,277
Just for fun.

535
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:16,445
Someone will see us, Sutton.

536
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,546
Then, we'll do it across town.

537
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,114
No one will recognize us.

538
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:21,149
What is the big deal?

539
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:22,484
Why is this so important to you?

540
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:25,320
Geez, just thought I'd spend

541
00:21:25,354 --> 00:21:26,421
some quality time with my sister,

542
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:28,256
but if you're not interested.

543
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,324
No.

544
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:32,994
Actually, I would love to.

545
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,698
You're on, sis.

546
00:21:36,732 --> 00:21:37,999
DAN: Thanks for coming down.

547
00:21:38,034 --> 00:21:39,901
Actually, I was already
planning on talking to you.

548
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:41,603
About what?

549
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:42,971
Well, you first. You said it was important.

550
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:44,806
Well, we need you to make a statement.

551
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:46,575
Some new evidence has come to light.

552
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:47,809
Someone called a waitress at the club

553
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:49,644
and paid her to plant the tire iron

554
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,745
in your father's golf bag.

555
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,481
- Wait. Somebody called?
- Yeah.

556
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:54,716
What was the waitress's name?

557
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,652
Jessica Whitman.

558
00:21:57,687 --> 00:22:00,655
Whoever called her set
your father up, Thayer.

559
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,592
Oh, my God. Dan, he wasn't set up.

560
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:06,595
He's the one who called.

561
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:09,231
Hello, T.

562
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:10,532
- What the hell?
- THERESA: It's okay, Thayer.

563
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:12,334
We just need to ask you some questions.

564
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:16,037
THAYER: Well, I've got some questions of my own.

565
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:17,172
Like...

566
00:22:20,276 --> 00:22:22,144
how do you explain this, for example?

567
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:27,983
Dad?

568
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:36,850
How can you say you've
never seen that phone before?

569
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:40,274
- I found it in our house.
- If it was there the whole time,

570
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:42,309
why didn't the police find it
when the searched the house?

571
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:44,211
They must have missed it.

572
00:22:44,245 --> 00:22:46,313
Come on. Look, whoever
planted the phone there,

573
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:49,149
planted it there after the search.

574
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:50,951
And then they called it

575
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:52,720
to be sure you'd find it.

576
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:54,054
Or maybe you just screwed up.

577
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:56,790
And you didn't hide it as
well as you think you did.

578
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:58,659
I'm no fool, son.

579
00:22:58,693 --> 00:22:59,693
- But you're a murderer.
- THERESA: Okay,

580
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:00,861
that's enough.

581
00:23:00,895 --> 00:23:01,929
This isn't getting us anywhere.

582
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,530
DAN: I got the lab results.

583
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:04,605
Our techs confirmed that...

584
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,434
it is indeed the cell phone used

585
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,736
to call Jessica Whitman.

586
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,571
THAYER: Ouch.

587
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:11,672
Case closed.

588
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:13,340
DAN: They also determined

589
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,408
that the call to Jessica...

590
00:23:14,442 --> 00:23:17,211
was made from Flagstaff, Arizona.

591
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:20,080
Weren't we playing golf the exact time

592
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:22,282
that phone call was made?

593
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,084
Yeah, it was a Friday, right?

594
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,319
I remember it 'cause you beat me

595
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:27,254
by one... you birdied 18.

596
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:29,023
- I know. I remember.
- So how could I be

597
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,824
playing golf with you in Scottsdale,

598
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:31,859
and also be in Flagstaff,

599
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:32,993
150 miles away?

600
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:34,795
I don't know. Maybe you hired someone.

601
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:37,631
Or maybe there's two of me.

602
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,934
Well, it backfired.

603
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:42,903
'Cause we got enough to go to the judge

604
00:23:42,937 --> 00:23:44,672
and get the charges against you dropped.

605
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:46,707
Oh, my God. No, no, no, please, please,

606
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:48,776
- you can't let him out.
- T, face it...

607
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,344
You were wrong about everything,

608
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:51,459
and the only mistake I made

609
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,513
was taking your bastard ass in

610
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:55,416
when nobody else gave a crap about you.

611
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,550
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Okay, okay...

612
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,218
DAN: Let's go. Let's go.

613
00:23:58,253 --> 00:23:59,520
Let's go.

614
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:04,558
Damn it. This can't be happening right now.

615
00:24:04,592 --> 00:24:06,527
You dad's getting out
whether you like it or not.

616
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:09,163
You need to find a way to deal with that.

617
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,365
Now go home and cool off.

618
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,971
WOMAN: Hi, this is
Lindsey Ridgeway's office

619
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:19,239
reminding you of your
appointment for Monday

620
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:21,942
at 10:00 a.m. Please
call us back to confirm.

621
00:24:21,976 --> 00:24:23,243
(beep)

622
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:26,426
You're still going to meet
with your divorce attorney?

623
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:28,395
I don't know.

624
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:30,330
Maybe.

625
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:32,299
It turns out we have a therapy session

626
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:36,203
the exact same time, so I do
have to cancel one of them.

627
00:24:36,237 --> 00:24:38,305
Do I get a vote on which one?

628
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:40,207
Oh, I already know your
vote, thank you very much,

629
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:42,242
and don't think I don't know
what you girls were up to

630
00:24:42,277 --> 00:24:43,917
with the whole plumbing thing. You are not

631
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:45,813
as clever as you think you are.

632
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:47,948
The point is, we would do anything

633
00:24:47,982 --> 00:24:49,650
to keep this family intact.

634
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:51,652
And canceling on the divorce attorney

635
00:24:51,686 --> 00:24:53,587
is hardly going to extremes.

636
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,758
(dance music playing)

637
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:08,702
JORDAN: I like this place.

638
00:25:08,736 --> 00:25:10,571
What do you think, Mads?

639
00:25:10,605 --> 00:25:13,574
I think there's too many people

640
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:15,342
trying too hard to be cool,

641
00:25:15,376 --> 00:25:17,377
but I'm not surprised you like it.

642
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:19,313
Excuse me?

643
00:25:19,347 --> 00:25:20,614
She's just kidding.

644
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:22,282
You were just kidding, right?

645
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:23,584
Yes, and you would know, Laurel,

646
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:26,286
because you have an amazing sense of humor,

647
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:27,354
an infectious laugh,

648
00:25:27,388 --> 00:25:29,256
great personality...

649
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,392
- Stop.
- Some might say that she is the total package.

650
00:25:32,427 --> 00:25:34,194
Well, don't sell yourself short.

651
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:36,997
Ugh. Well, thank you, stepbrother.

652
00:25:37,031 --> 00:25:38,098
I'm gonna go to the bar.

653
00:25:38,132 --> 00:25:39,199
Anyone want a drink?

654
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:41,101
Sure. You want any help?

655
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:44,004
No. You stay here with
Laurel. I'll get the drinks.

656
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:46,673
- Well, at least let me buy.
- I really don't want your money.

657
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,609
Hey, I'm sorry.

658
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:49,877
Did I do something wrong?

659
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:51,044
Ha! There she goes again.

660
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,880
Hey, I'll just take a water.

661
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:55,515
If that's cool.

662
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,650
What're you gonna drink, Mads?

663
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:57,885
A Cosmo? Sex on the beach?

664
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,387
You know what? I'm gonna go home.

665
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:02,489
He's all yours. You two enjoy your evening.

666
00:26:04,726 --> 00:26:06,460
Um, I'm really sorry.

667
00:26:06,494 --> 00:26:09,296
I have no idea what just happened.

668
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,631
Forget about it.

669
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,499
It's fine.

670
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,234
Let's dance.

671
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:25,312
Hey.

672
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:27,014
- Hi.
- You playing today?

673
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:29,182
No, I was just warming up.

674
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:34,054
I'm actually headed across town
to have a match with Sutton.

675
00:26:34,088 --> 00:26:36,189
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm. It was her idea.

676
00:26:36,224 --> 00:26:39,026
I'm sure she has some
sort of ulterior motive.

677
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,596
You guys are gonna just be alone together?

678
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,531
Yes, we're gonna be alone together.

679
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:46,800
I can't wait to hear
what she has on her mind.

680
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:49,469
Hey...

681
00:26:49,504 --> 00:26:51,772
how did your test go?

682
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:53,807
Uh, 73.

683
00:26:53,841 --> 00:26:55,475
I passed.

684
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,479
- That's awesome.
- Yeah, well, I had a pretty good tutor.

685
00:26:59,514 --> 00:27:01,248
You think you might

686
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:03,116
want to keep helping me with that stuff?

687
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:04,484
So I can stay a free man.

688
00:27:07,088 --> 00:27:09,256
Yeah, I can do that. Yeah.

689
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,125
All right. Thanks.

690
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,961
Come here.

691
00:27:13,995 --> 00:27:15,996
I'm so happy for you.

692
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,998
Hey...

693
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:20,834
what's going on here?

694
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:23,737
Um, I was just thanking her for helping me.

695
00:27:23,771 --> 00:27:25,739
Uh, she tutored me.

696
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,007
Tutoring you?

697
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,775
Yeah. I thought you knew.

698
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,644
Uh, no, actually.

699
00:27:30,678 --> 00:27:32,579
Wait, hold on. So last night...

700
00:27:32,613 --> 00:27:33,814
that's where you had to go?

701
00:27:33,848 --> 00:27:36,583
The test was today.

702
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:38,585
Wow.

703
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:42,255
You know what? It doesn't matter.

704
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,423
Thayer...

705
00:27:49,362 --> 00:27:50,380
Alec is getting out?

706
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,508
The judge is signing off on it now.

707
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:54,600
It's obvious that he was framed.

708
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:56,902
Of course. By whom?

709
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:59,905
Well, the call to the waitress
came from Flagstaff, Arizona.

710
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:02,441
Does that mean anything to you?

711
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:04,543
Flagstaff, uh, no.

712
00:28:04,577 --> 00:28:06,512
Not at all.

713
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:09,281
Anyway, he should be out by this evening.

714
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:10,582
You two should celebrate.

715
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:13,385
Yes, I thought this day would never come.

716
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,121
Thank you so much, Theresa.

717
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,394
Hey, Ted, I just got

718
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:25,064
- the most amazing news.
- Really? What?

719
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:26,999
Alec's being released.

720
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:28,133
- Really?
- Yeah.

721
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:29,835
Wow. That...

722
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:31,136
I didn't expect that.

723
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:33,972
Neither was I.

724
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:36,608
Actually.

725
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:40,813
Well why are you so upset?

726
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:46,385
I'm scared, Ted.

727
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:48,654
It's just whenever I've gone to see

728
00:28:48,688 --> 00:28:51,590
Alec in jail, I've gotten the feeling

729
00:28:51,624 --> 00:28:54,660
that he might blame me for his arrest.

730
00:28:54,694 --> 00:28:56,228
Well, that's ridiculous.

731
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:57,463
You've been more supportive than anyone.

732
00:28:57,497 --> 00:28:59,198
Yeah, well...

733
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:01,133
you know how he gets.

734
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:03,035
His temper.

735
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:05,204
Well, if you are that afraid,

736
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:07,139
why don't you leave town?

737
00:29:07,173 --> 00:29:09,108
Go back to L.A.?

738
00:29:09,142 --> 00:29:11,910
You don't really mean that?

739
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:15,080
I thought that...

740
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:16,882
You thought wrong.

741
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:19,818
I see.

742
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:22,755
Well, I can't...

743
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:24,757
run away, not again.

744
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:26,458
I mean, everything I love is here.

745
00:29:26,493 --> 00:29:27,760
My roots are here.

746
00:29:27,794 --> 00:29:30,596
My family is here.

747
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,499
You mean Jordan?

748
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:35,434
Who else would I mean?

749
00:29:35,468 --> 00:29:37,603
Well, I'm, I'm sorry.

750
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:40,339
I shouldn't have fallen
apart on you like this.

751
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:42,441
And I thank you for being there for me.

752
00:29:51,951 --> 00:29:53,952
(sighs)

753
00:29:53,987 --> 00:29:57,089
Thayer, hi. It's Emma again.

754
00:29:57,123 --> 00:29:58,957
Are you okay?

755
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:00,726
Please call me back.

756
00:30:02,762 --> 00:30:04,062
Trouble in paradise?

757
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:05,964
Are you sure nobody's
gonna recognize us here?

758
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:07,120
Please, anyone worth knowing

759
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,767
wouldn't be caught dead here.

760
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:09,868
All right.

761
00:30:09,903 --> 00:30:12,671
You serve.

762
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:14,840
I'm sure you haven't played in a while.

763
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:17,876
Always so considerate, Emma.

764
00:30:17,911 --> 00:30:20,712
Well, care to make things interesting?

765
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:22,447
Well, what did you have in mind?

766
00:30:22,482 --> 00:30:23,515
Well, whoever wins

767
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,250
is obviously the best player,

768
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:27,686
so she should be the one
that plays at regionals.

769
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,255
So that's what this is about.

770
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,590
You want to switch back.

771
00:30:31,624 --> 00:30:33,525
For a few days. Just for regionals.

772
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,260
Unless, of course,
you're too scared, then...

773
00:30:35,295 --> 00:30:37,095
you don't have to.

774
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,231
Oh, I'm not scared. You should be scared,

775
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:42,000
'cause I will wipe these courts with you.

776
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:44,369
Feisty, Emma.

777
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:47,105
Fine. We have a deal?

778
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,975
No, actually, I have some of my own terms.

779
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:51,009
Whoever loses...

780
00:30:51,044 --> 00:30:53,078
has to stay in the cabin.

781
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,947
For real this time.

782
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:57,049
Can't step foot out of it. Understand?

783
00:31:00,553 --> 00:31:03,488
Good luck.

784
00:31:03,523 --> 00:31:04,790
May the best sister win.

785
00:31:04,824 --> 00:31:06,692
Oh, I will.

786
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:08,560
Oh, hey.

787
00:31:08,595 --> 00:31:11,597
I wanted to apologize
for last night. I, um,

788
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:13,599
- I guess I kind of screwed things up.
- Oh, no.

789
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:15,701
Leaving was the best
thing you could've done.

790
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:17,502
I never should've asked you to come along.

791
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:20,405
Oh, so things worked
out with you and Jordan?

792
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,441
We danced for a while and
talked for, like, hours

793
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:25,177
about music and bands and life.

794
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:27,980
He's so sweet and cute.

795
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:30,182
I think we're gonna go out again next week.

796
00:31:30,216 --> 00:31:33,118
Awesome. Well, I'm really happy for you.

797
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:34,219
Me, too.

798
00:31:34,254 --> 00:31:35,888
You're the best.

799
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:39,791
(phone rings)

800
00:31:39,826 --> 00:31:42,794
Hey, Thayer. What's up?

801
00:31:45,665 --> 00:31:47,633
What?

802
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:58,477
That's me on the first set. 6-2.

803
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:00,379
You're on fire.

804
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:01,480
Well,

805
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:02,748
we can quit if you want.

806
00:32:02,782 --> 00:32:06,418
No, no. I'm just a little off.

807
00:32:06,452 --> 00:32:08,587
Haven't really been getting
much sleep this week.

808
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:10,322
That's 'cause you're running around town

809
00:32:10,356 --> 00:32:12,224
when you should be up at
that cabin just relaxing.

810
00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:13,492
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard to relax

811
00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:15,494
when Ethan just drops by
in the middle of the night.

812
00:32:15,528 --> 00:32:17,362
Excuse me.

813
00:32:17,397 --> 00:32:20,232
Oh...

814
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:23,268
after Jordan's party, he stopped by,

815
00:32:23,303 --> 00:32:26,038
and you said it was
fine, so I slept with him.

816
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,000
You're cool with that, right?

817
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:31,810
Yeah, whatever. He can...

818
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:33,946
he can do what he wants.

819
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,848
Good, 'cause I totally thought
you'd be, like, really upset.

820
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:38,884
I'm not.

821
00:32:38,918 --> 00:32:41,486
Obviously.

822
00:32:41,521 --> 00:32:43,355
My serve.

823
00:32:58,371 --> 00:32:59,604
Hey.

824
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:03,175
The, um, the cam, um...

825
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:04,242
(snaps fingers)

826
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:05,277
Chain tensioner.

827
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:06,278
Yeah, that's the one.

828
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,281
Do you mind taking a look at it?

829
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:11,116
All right.

830
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,220
Sutton's not here, is she?

831
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:18,123
Why would she be?

832
00:33:18,157 --> 00:33:19,858
Just asking.

833
00:33:19,892 --> 00:33:22,928
Never seem to know where
she's gonna pop up next.

834
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:24,830
It didn't sound like
your tensioner, but, um,

835
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:26,765
we're probably gonna check
your plugs out, all right?

836
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,634
What's the deal with you guys anyways?

837
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:34,940
Look, it's, uh... it's complicated.

838
00:33:34,974 --> 00:33:37,843
Okay, she used to be one person and...

839
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:40,545
now she's someone else.

840
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,781
And you don't know which one you like more.

841
00:33:42,815 --> 00:33:45,717
- Something like that, yeah.
- Chicks.

842
00:33:45,752 --> 00:33:48,387
Even when you know they're
completely wrong for you,

843
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:50,522
you still can't stop thinking about them.

844
00:33:50,556 --> 00:33:53,125
Sounds to me like you're
the one with the problem.

845
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:54,426
Yeah, tell me about it.

846
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,428
But hey, I did see Sutton at the cabin.

847
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:57,996
She's into you, man.

848
00:33:58,031 --> 00:33:59,064
Like, hardcore into you.

849
00:33:59,098 --> 00:34:00,232
If I were you,

850
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:01,900
I wouldn't overthink it.

851
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:04,036
If I were you,

852
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,971
I wouldn't either.

853
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:40,572
MADS: Emma!

854
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:42,641
Mads?

855
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:43,708
Time-out.

856
00:34:43,743 --> 00:34:44,824
MADS: Thank God I found you.

857
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:46,611
- Hey.
- Hey.

858
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:47,712
What's the matter?

859
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:49,781
Thayer just called to say good-bye.

860
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:51,383
He's moving back to L.A.

861
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:52,317
I guess things got pretty ugly

862
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:53,585
between him and my dad.

863
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:56,621
Oh, I knew something was wrong with him.

864
00:34:56,656 --> 00:34:59,458
Uh-oh. Drama.

865
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:00,492
I really wanted to make peace between them,

866
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:01,493
but he won't listen to me,

867
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:03,061
and Emma, I think you might be

868
00:35:03,096 --> 00:35:04,362
the only person who can keep him here.

869
00:35:04,397 --> 00:35:05,430
And you've got to hurry

870
00:35:05,465 --> 00:35:06,965
'cause he's packing right now.

871
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:09,334
Tick-tock.

872
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:12,938
Congratulations, Sutton.

873
00:35:12,972 --> 00:35:14,739
You win. I forfeit.

874
00:35:35,894 --> 00:35:37,027
Thayer.

875
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:39,863
You shouldn't have come, Emma.

876
00:35:39,898 --> 00:35:41,799
I don't understand.

877
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:42,933
What happened with Alec?

878
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:44,968
He won, like he always does.

879
00:35:45,003 --> 00:35:46,904
He's getting out of jail,
so I can't stay here anymore.

880
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:48,739
What, he's getting out?

881
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:49,773
How?

882
00:35:49,808 --> 00:35:51,742
That phone I found exonerated him.

883
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:52,843
Can you believe that?

884
00:35:52,877 --> 00:35:54,778
Okay...

885
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:56,480
well, you don't have to leave.

886
00:35:56,514 --> 00:35:57,881
I mean, you could stay someplace else.

887
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:59,817
Emma, I don't really live here.

888
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:01,618
I only came back to help you and Sutton,

889
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:03,420
but every single time I do, it always leads

890
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:06,390
back to my father, and I
can't, I can't beat him.

891
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:12,596
It's killing me.

892
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,299
I'm sorry.

893
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,414
You know what, the truth is,

894
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:19,136
there is nothing left for me here anymore.

895
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,108
What about me?

896
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:27,911
I'm... I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about Ethan, but...

897
00:36:27,946 --> 00:36:29,012
It's not about that.

898
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:34,952
I want you to come with me.

899
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,793
Uh... uh... Thayer, I can't do that.

900
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:45,629
The Mercers are the only
family I've ever known.

901
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:47,798
I can't leave them right now.

902
00:36:49,634 --> 00:36:51,401
Well, I can't...

903
00:36:51,436 --> 00:36:53,303
I can't stay either.

904
00:36:54,472 --> 00:36:57,341
So then that's it?

905
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,145
Maybe it's for the best.

906
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:04,882
No, I... I...

907
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,766
Take care of yourself.

908
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:32,576
(engine starts)

909
00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:45,155
See? Good as new.

910
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,391
Guess I'll just get out of your way.

911
00:37:49,093 --> 00:37:51,862
Ted, about that counseling
session on Monday.

912
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:53,897
I'll be there.

913
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:55,265
What about your other appointment?

914
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:59,002
I canceled it.

915
00:38:00,872 --> 00:38:02,139
That's good to hear,

916
00:38:02,173 --> 00:38:03,933
but I hope you brought
your checkbook, ma'am,

917
00:38:03,942 --> 00:38:06,743
'cause you've rung up
quite a hefty plumbing bill.

918
00:38:09,547 --> 00:38:11,481
Chicken parmigiana?

919
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:12,549
Leftovers.

920
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:14,418
LAUREL: Looks like everything is getting

921
00:38:14,452 --> 00:38:17,421
back to normal around here.

922
00:38:17,455 --> 00:38:19,723
Yes, your father fixed the drain.

923
00:38:19,757 --> 00:38:23,427
I wasn't talking about the plumbing.

924
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,374
Do you want me to get Laurel?

925
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:39,088
You know, honestly, I can't figure you out.

926
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,911
One minute, you're hot; the
next minute, you're cold.

927
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,012
Do you even know what you want?

928
00:38:42,046 --> 00:38:45,148
What about you? You're
practically stalking me.

929
00:38:45,183 --> 00:38:46,850
I am not interested, okay?

930
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:48,018
Oh, is that right?

931
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:49,019
Yeah.

932
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:14,711
(sighs)

933
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:26,356
Well, I love the smell
of freedom in the evening.

934
00:39:26,391 --> 00:39:27,357
The press is at the other entrance,

935
00:39:27,392 --> 00:39:28,425
just like you requested.

936
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:30,260
Perfect.

937
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:32,129
There'll be plenty of time
for grandstanding later.

938
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:33,997
Do you need a lift home?

939
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:36,033
No.

940
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:38,335
I've got a stop to make.

941
00:39:40,204 --> 00:39:43,106
(distant thunder rumbles)

942
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:45,842
Tell my wife I'm coming for her.

943
00:39:50,915 --> 00:39:53,016
You were in Flagstaff?

944
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:55,018
You were supposed to make
that call from the golf course

945
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:57,554
so no one would question it.

946
00:39:57,588 --> 00:39:59,489
No, I don't want you to do anything.

947
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:01,758
Alec will be here any minute.

948
00:40:01,793 --> 00:40:02,826
(chuckles)

949
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,729
I know exactly how to handle him.

950
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:08,332
(thunder rumbles)

951
00:40:09,434 --> 00:40:11,301
(sighs)

952
00:40:15,506 --> 00:40:18,408
(thunder crashes)

953
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:26,950
Hey, baby, I'm home.

954
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:31,121
Darling, I've missed you so much.

955
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,963
I'll bet.

956
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,497
(sighs)

957
00:41:13,531 --> 00:41:16,133
God, you scare easily.

958
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:18,168
Well, what do you expect?
There's a murderer out there.

959
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:22,039
Hey, so, I'm really sorry
about the Thayer thing.

960
00:41:22,073 --> 00:41:24,074
Tough break, but a deal's a deal.

961
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:27,411
And if you remember, not one
foot outside of the cabin.

962
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:29,246
Your terms, I recall.

963
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,914
And what if I refuse?

964
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,949
You wouldn't dare.

965
00:41:32,984 --> 00:41:34,184
Try me.

966
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:37,854
Shoot. I was afraid this would happen.

967
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:40,957
See, I'm not going to go either, so...

968
00:41:40,992 --> 00:41:44,928
I think we're gonna just have to
tell the family our big secret,

969
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:46,863
which is going to be really
tough because Kristin,

970
00:41:46,898 --> 00:41:48,131
I don't really know how
she's going to react.

971
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:51,201
She's very fragile right now.

972
00:41:51,235 --> 00:41:53,136
You're bluffing.

973
00:41:53,171 --> 00:41:55,105
Try me.

974
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:01,111
Fine.

975
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:02,946
I'm leaving,

976
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,881
but Ted and Kristin are
making really good progress,

977
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:06,283
so just promise me that
you'll keep pushing them

978
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:08,118
in the right direction.

979
00:42:08,152 --> 00:42:11,221
Yes! Of course! They're my parents.

980
00:42:11,255 --> 00:42:13,090
You think I don't want them together?

981
00:42:13,124 --> 00:42:15,092
All right, I'll see you in a couple days.

982
00:42:15,126 --> 00:42:17,027
I left some clean towels
for you at the cabin.

983
00:42:18,096 --> 00:42:19,262
You may need them.

984
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:22,132
See,

985
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,867
I can be considerate too, Emma.

986
00:42:25,303 --> 00:42:27,037
Good luck at regionals.

987
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:28,872
I don't need luck.
