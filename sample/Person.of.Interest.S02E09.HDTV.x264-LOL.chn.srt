鉴于出租车司机被害的机率

曾是最被看好的棒球投手

后来在07年小联盟二A级赛中韧带撕裂

68
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,470
可惜了他的手臂

从统计数据看  他的曲线球很棒

然后被命运的曲线球砸中了

00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,710
从被看好的联盟球星变成无人问津的出租车司机

看看我们还能发现什么

77
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,600
别急嘛  里瑟先生

是啊  得小心乘客啊

每天都有很多陌生人坐上你的车
Must be tough dealing with complete strangers

84
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,320
肯定不太好应付
getting in your car every day.

85
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,160
有时候吧
Sometimes.

86
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,810
每次我从后视镜里看到乘客

87
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,060
从来都不知道自己载的
I never know if I'm driving around

88
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,800
是好人还是坏人  你明白吧
a good guy or a bad guy, you know?

89
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,200
我无从想像
I can only imagine.

90
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,510
那肯定挺能锻炼你的识人能力
Must make you a good judge of character, though.

91
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,300
你怎么看我呢
What do you make of me?

只是略点缀方巾
Except for the pocket square.

95
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,590
不过你彬彬有礼  谈吐优雅  颇有思想

96
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,110
你的背心

我不知道  也许是教授或者

105
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,050
威胁可能来自
The threat could come

106
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,840
全城八百万人中的任何一位
from any one of 8 million people in this city.

107
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
我跟住他了
I'm right on him.

108
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,910
我用奥多涅斯的手机黑入了
I'm using Ordonez's cell to piggyback

109
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,860
进入他车内的所有手机

我记得这里曾是农田

我以前在那边打过兔子  就在六米外

看起来没一个神智清醒的

117
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,550

你敢再这样  咱们就有麻烦了
One more time, we're gonna have a real problem.

126

127
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,180
我不能确定奥多涅斯是否纠结于
I can't tell if Ordonez has more of an issue

128
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,810
酗酒问题  收音机问题  或棒球问题

手臂受伤后
After what happened to his arm,

130
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,920
他可能只想尽量忘记
he probably just wants to tune it out.

131
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,610
就他车上的这些乘客看来
Looking into every passenger that gets into his cab--

132
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,890
不太可能
it's impossible.

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,890
没有前科

134
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,630
没有车辆委员会投诉纪录

没有

140

不过如果你想要的话

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,680
我可以黑进他们的网络
I could hack into their network

142
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,010
添加批准申请的纪录
and make it look like I did.

143
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,300
只要几分钟时间就行
It would only take me a few minutes.

144
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,390
当我没说
Never mind.

145

我会跟每天的犯罪记录比对

149
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,580
听起来似乎进展不错
Sounded like it really went well.

150
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,570

反正他们大多数不是死了就是进监狱了
Most of them are either dead or in jail anyway.

156
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,100
这种时刻
At this point,

157
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,040
更叫人疑惑脱身的是谁
you got to wonder who's even left.

158

联调局的调查结束了

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,080
局里的眼线说唐纳利一直在狂叫打倒HR
My fed contact says Donnelly's been crowing about burying HR.

160
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,770
然而  我们还在
And yet, here we are.

161
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,420
不过  我们还有个大麻烦
Still, we have a larger problem.

162
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,360
没人能把我们交待出去
No one's gonna open their mouth about us.

163
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,860
我安排妥了
I made sure of that.

164
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,110
必须万无一失  我的朋友
Make no mistake, my friend.

165
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,700
我们只是生意人
We are just businessmen,

166
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,410
而生意要靠金钱  收益
And businesses run on money, revenue.

167
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,170
这需要点时间
That's gonna take some time.

168
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,160
我们得招募新的人才
We need to read in some new talent.

169
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,230
重建
Rebuild.

170
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,030
我们当初背叛以利亚实在不明智
We made a tactical error turning our back on Elias.

171
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,810
即使身在监狱  他仍是这个城市真正的老大
Even from jail, he is the de facto boss of the city.

172
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,920
想东山再起  我们需要他的支持
We need his backing in order to operate.

173
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,140
这可有难度
That might be problematic.

174
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,350
安排下会面
Set a meeting.

175
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
是时候双方求和
Time we make peace, get us walking

176
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,030
共同谋求彼此的共同利益了
on the same path again for our mutual benefit.

177
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,240
提个建议
And a suggestion.

178
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,230
万一这会面不如预期
Should this meeting take a less than cordial turn--

179
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,300
不用担心  我会带支援的
Don't worry. I'll bring some backup.

180
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,690
弗斯科警探  今天是你的幸运日
Detective Fusco, it's your lucky day.

181
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,780
有事找你
I'm calling in a chip.

182
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,490
我们要安排一场会面  跟以利亚的人谈谈
We're gonna set up a meet, talk to Elias' guys.

183
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,160
费尔曼进了一家维修站  芬奇
Fermin's taking a pit stop, Finch.

184
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,120
-阿齐兹  -费尔曼
- Aziz. - Fermin.

185
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,130
老兄  你拿到没
Hey, man. Do you have it?

186
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,780
我说过了  我找到买家了
Yeah, I told you I'd find a buyer for it.

187
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,990
太好了  我正需要  我马上要过去
Good, I need it. I'm on my way over there now.

188
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,370
好的
All right.

189
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,090
手提电脑八百块
800 for the laptop.

190
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,680
你不相信我啊
You don't trust me?

191
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,140
一点儿也不信
Not at all.

192
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,750
好吧
Okay.

193
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,380
谢谢

194
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,660
-太谢谢你了  兄弟  -祝你好运  我的朋友
- Thank you so much, man. - Good luck, my friend.

195
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,580
芬奇  我想我知道这位司机的存款怎么了
Finch, I think I know what happened to our cabbie's savings.

196
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,500
他现在全部随身带着
He's carrying it all around with him right now.

197
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,900
我们肯定忽视了什么
We must have overlooked something.

198
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,070
他有赌债吗
Does he have gambling debts?

199
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,630
他在贩毒吗
Is he dealing drugs?

200
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,550
不管什么  反正马上要进行了
Whatever it is, it's about to go down.

201
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,000
看来他要买什么东西
Looks like he's about to buy something,

202
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,400
或者买个平安
or buy his way out of a big hole.

203
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,660
门多萨先生
Senor Mendoza.

204
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,990
费尔曼
Fermin.

205
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,600
坐

206
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,540
这是说好的玛丽亚和豪尔赫的四万块

207
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,040
他们  能安全过来吗
Do they, uh... have a safe way to get here?

208
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,830
这是我老婆孩子最近的照片
This is the last photo I have of my wife and son.

209
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,730
有点小问题  费尔曼
We have a slight problem, Fermin.

210
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,140
价格提高了
The price has gone up.

211
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,130
什么意思
What do you mean?

212
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,710
你的钱只够玛丽亚或者豪尔赫一个人过来
I mean, you only have enough money for Maria or Jorge,

213
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,470
两个人不够
but not both.

214
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,510
不
No.

215
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,060
门多萨先生  别这样
Senor Mendoza, don't do this.

216
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,990
你知道他们现在待在古巴已经不安全了
You know it is not safe for them in Cuba anymore.

217
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,210
玛丽亚说邻居开始起疑了
Maria says that the neighbors are getting curious.

218
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,740
他们觉察到她和豪尔赫要离开了
They sense that she and Jorge are leaving soon.

219
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,890
如果被政府发现
If an official finds out,

220
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,780
他们会因涉嫌逃走而被捕
they will arrest her on suspicion.

221
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,120
费尔曼  我们认识多久了
Fermin, we've known each other for how long?

222
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,030
别人都不管你时我依然在帮你
I helped you when everybody stopped caring.

223
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,920
你手术后  职业生涯完蛋了
Put you back on your feet after the surgery

224
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,870
是我帮你站起来的
when your career was over.

225
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,740
价钱不是我能控制的
These are prices I do not control.

226
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,990
可我哪儿能再拿四万块出来呢
But how am I supposed to come up with another $40,000?

227
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,900
这是一片充满机遇的土地  我的朋友
It's the land of opportunity, my friend.

228
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,400
会有办法的
You'll find a way.

229
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,450
奥多涅斯走投无路了  芬奇
Ordonez is a desperate man, Finch.

230
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,380
辛辛苦苦地开了五年出租车
Pushing around his cab for the past five years,

231
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,040
才攒够钱带他的老婆孩子过来
saving up to bring his wife and his kid here.

232
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,780
结果功亏一篑啊
Sounds like he just came up short.

233
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,950
谁知道他为了一家团聚
Who knows what he'd be willing to do

234
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,550
甘愿做出什么事呢
to get his family back?

235
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,760
我黑进了古巴的政府数据库
I hacked the Cuban government database.

236
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,530
系统复杂得出乎意料呢
Surprisingly sophisticated software.

237
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,860
毫无疑问  是俄罗斯人提供的
No doubt, courtesy of the Russians.

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,680
别告诉我菲德尔・卡斯特罗真死了
Don't tell me Fidel Castro's really dead.

239
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,970
事实上  是的
Actually, yes.

240
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,130
而且他的替身得了癌症
And his body double has cancer.

241
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,080
古巴把所有叛逃的人都列入在案
The Cubans keep a file on every defector.

242
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,380
显然  奥多涅斯是古巴国家队
Apparently, Ordonez pitched for the Cuban national team

243
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,740
00到05年间的投手
from 2000 to 2005,

244
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,600
然后他逃到了美国
when he defected to the US

245
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,290
想让自己的妻儿得到更好的生活
wanted a better life for his wife and child.

246
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,380
古巴早在监控摄像头和网络出来之前
Cuba was a surveillance state long before the advent

247
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,430
就开始全面监控了
of security cameras and digital networking.

248
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,270
如果他们发现他的家人想要叛逃
If they catch his family trying to defect,

249
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,690
他的妻子就会进监狱
his wife can go to prison.

250
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,810
所以奥多涅斯才这么不顾一切地
Explains why Ordonez is so desperate

251
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,660
想让他的家人离开
to get his family out of there.

252
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,560
不顾一切  就会不择手段
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

253
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,860
跟紧了  里瑟先生
Stay close, Mr. Reese.

254
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,350
奥多涅斯关了车上的出租信号
Ordonez turned off his sign.

255
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,100
他不是在等客人
He's not looking for a fare.

256
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
那他在等谁
So who's he waiting for?

257
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,430
阿斯科塔  阿斯科塔  这边  老兄
Acosta! Acosta! Over here, man!

258
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,590
看这边  阿斯科塔  美满一家

259
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,470
拉裴尔・阿斯科塔

260
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,860
是纽约队的二垒手
Plays second base for New York.

261
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,250
拉裴尔・阿斯科塔  当然了
Rafael Acosta? Of course.

262
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,270
05年他们一起出逃的
They defected together in '05.

263
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,370
在一次国际棒球锦标赛中
Escaped from a hotel room in the Netherlands

264
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,630
从荷兰的一家酒店逃离
during an international baseball tournament.

265
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,740
阿斯科塔  他今年混的很不错
Acosta--he's having a pretty good year.

266
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,210
事业风生水起  里瑟先生
Career year, Mr. Reese.

267
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,420
近三场来他在内场选手中名列前十
He's top ten in OPs among infielders for the last three.

268
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,610
你简直是棒球百科机器  芬奇
You're a baseball reference machine, Finch.

269
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,580
你应该多出出门
You should get out more,

270
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,330
偶尔打打比赛
take in a game once in a while.

271
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,870
谁说我没有的
Who says I don't?

272
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,800
拉裴
Hey, Raffi.

273
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,910
费尔曼

274
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,280
怎么了伙计

275
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,450
没什么

276
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,450
抱歉  我刚没认出你来  好久没见了

277
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,100
确实不太联系了

278

还好
It's okay.

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,080
我  我真不想开口
Look, man, I-I hate to ask,

281
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,480
但是  我
but, you see, I, uh

282
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,950
我家人那边需要点帮助
I just need a little help with mi familia, you know?

283

是啊  是啊
Oh, yeah, yeah.

284
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,240
没问题
Of course, uh...

285
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,160
他们怎么样
How are they?

286
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,970
我不太清楚  拉裴
I don't really know, Raffi.

287
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,350

我已经很久没看到他们了

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,390
宝贝  我们走吧

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,060
阿斯科塔得到了奥多涅斯梦寐以求的生活
Acosta ended up with the life Ordonez could have had.

296
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,750
现在他只想让家人团聚

你手下的肮脏事可不少
You got one too many skeletons in the closet

302
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,880
戴维森

303
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,170
足够用了
to be calling the shots here.

304
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,200
失踪
戴维森

305

更不用说  还有些埋在地下的

以利亚很会利用人

312
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,790
叫你过来是因为  如果事情出了岔子
You're here because if this thing goes sideways,

313
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,860
他们可以找你出气

以利亚支持重建HR

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,180
是我  我正在和他们会面

329
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,880
交易是这样的
So here's the deal.

330
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,850
老大接受了你的提议
The boss accepts your offer...

331
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,740

我们没兴趣跑去抓他

不过  既然尸体出现在纽约

375
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,190
如果找到谁载他过来的

376
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,390
也许就能找到凶手
We could find the shooter.

377
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,860

你们排查整个区域  我们去调阅监控摄像

GPS显示那位司机昨晚在晨间公园

逗留了至少25分钟
for a window of 25 minutes last night,

385
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,110
正是某位俄罗斯人
right around the time

386
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,640
中枪身亡的时段
some Russian guy succumbs to acute lead poisoning.

387

你觉得那位出租车司机
And you think our cab driver

388
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,660
和这起谋杀案有关
is connected to this homicide?

389
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,920
我还以为你能告诉我
Figured you could tell me.

390
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,390
还有  为什么特勤局要掺和
Along with, why are the secret service crawling

391
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,820
这起调查
all over this investigation?

00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,930
我不知道
I have no idea.

393
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,890
要是你能调查出的话就太好了
But whatever you can find out would be much appreciated.

394
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,000
不太可能
Unlikely,

395
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,120
鉴于他们跟你们一样
considering they're about as forthcoming

396
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,520
不太爱分享信息
with information as you are.

397
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,050
我尽力而为吧
I'll see what I can find out.

瓦蒂姆・普什科夫
Vadim Pushkov.

400
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,860
如果牵涉到了特勤局
If the secret service is involved,

401
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,890
那他有可能是国际罪犯
he's likely some kind of international criminal.

402
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,470
看来这位司机昨晚载错了人
Seems like our cabbie gave the wrong guy a ride last night.

403
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,620
从59街大桥走  去皇后区

我似乎没法黑进这个女人的手机
I can't seem to access this woman's phone.

408
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,930
她不是没有手机

409
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,460

一直往下开

这里右转

在单行道的岔口转弯了
One-way street that bottlenecks down the way.

417
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,250
就停在这吧
This is good right here.

418
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,790
他们停在路当中了
They're stopped in the middle of the block.

419
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,400
她在引他到无人烟处  芬奇
She's isolated him, Finch.

420
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,200
11.5美元

421
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,270

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,820
我每天都要见很多人
I see a lot of people... every day.

426
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,660
他叫普什科夫  你载过他

427
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,360
他有落下什么东西吗
Did he leave anything behind?

428
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,600
别对我说谎
Do not lie to me.

429
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,980
女士
Look, lady,

430

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,170
我找不到的
I didn't find it.

433
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,270
清理掉

435

事情是这样的
Here's the thing.

436
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,440
你还是载我一程吧
You're gonna want to give me a lift anyway.

437
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,420
我今天倒霉透了  知道不

438

你还是  下车好吧

439
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,520
恐怕你会碰到更倒霉的  费尔曼
I'm afraid it's gonna get a whole lot worse, Fermin.

440
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,280
我不想惹麻烦
I don't want any trouble.

441
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,100
不幸的是  这点上你我都没有发言权

442
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,110
现在听好了
Now listen up.

443
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,980
我们被围堵了  大概有两辆车
We're about ready to be boxed in by two cars.

444
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,310
四到六个枪手
Four to six shooters.

445
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,660
我需要你瞄准他们车的后围侧板
I want you to aim for the rear quarter panel of their car,

446
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,200
不要熄火  明白了吗
and don't let off the gas, you got that?

447
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,370
就是现在  费尔曼
Now's a good time, Fermin.

448
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,590
-等等  什么  -快  费尔曼

里瑟先生  你没事吧
Mr. Reese, are you okay?

450
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,380
我没事  芬奇
I'm fine, Finch.

451
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,810
但是真正的威胁找上门了
But I think the real threat just found us.

452
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,370
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

453
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,750
他们是什么人
Who are those people?

454
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,360
里瑟先生  那个把他引入陷阱的金发女人
Mr. Reese, the blonde who led him into the trap

455
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,350
一下车就打了个电话
made a call just after leaving the cab.

456
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,500
我没法完整辨别
I can't quite make it out.

457
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,900
但我确信她讲的是爱沙尼亚语
But I believe it's Estonian.

458
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,140
爱沙尼亚黑帮
Estonian mob.

459
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,840
我认出他们的手法了
I recognize their methods.

460
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,540
围杀
It was a kill box.

461
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,530
在俄罗斯有过类似经历
Had a similar experience in Russia.

462
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,590
对他们来说效果不佳
Didn't work out too well for them.

463
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,770
关掉GPS
Disabled the GPS.

464
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,450
不能冒险让他们追踪到你
Can't risk them accessing it to track you down.

465
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,630
你是谁
Who are you?

466
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,500
搭车人
Just a guy who needed a ride.

467
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,220
那个女人问了你昨天载的一个乘客
That woman asked about a passenger in your cab last night.

468
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,990
他叫普什科夫  他怎么了
His name is Pushkov. What happened to him?

469
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,450
我不认识这个普什科夫
I don't know this Pushkov!

470
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,660
我只是个出租车司机
I'm just a cab driver!

471
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,090
怎么  你还要像对那个女人一样对我撒谎吗
What, you're gonna lie to me like you lied to that woman?

472
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,030
我们可大不相同  费尔曼
There's a big difference here, Fermin.

473
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,300
我是唯一能够帮你的人  明白吗
I'm the only one who can help you, you understand?

474
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,450
那你是为什么要帮我
So why are you helping me?

475
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,030
也许是因为你是个正常的人
Maybe you're an honest guy

476
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,060
只是犯了点小错误
who just made a mistake.

477
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,310
但你得想清楚  你生命的价值是否
But you need to decide whether your life's worth more

478
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,100
比那人落在出租车里的东西高
than whatever that guy left in your cab.

479
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,610
好吧
Okay.

480
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,840
我在机场载上这个人
I picked this guy up near the airport, huh?

481
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,480
我们开了好一会儿  他看起来很紧张
We drove around for a while. He seemed nervous.

482
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,950
他用俄语打电话
He spoke in Russian on his cell phone.

483
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,850
-你懂俄语吗  -一点点
- You understand Russian? - A little.

484
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,170
我小时候在古巴  我祖父说俄语
My grandfather spoke it when I was a kid in Cuba.

485
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,380
听起来他是想要卖掉什么东西
It sounded like he was trying to sell something.

486
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,620
他说  "H说"
He called it, uh, "H-said,"

487
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,830
还说什么  "旅客"
Or--or--or "Travelers".

488
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,710
我不知道他在讲什么
I didn't know what he was talking about.

489
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,380
那个金发女人说他落了东西在你车上
That blonde lady said he left something in your cab.

490
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,360
是什么
What was it?

491
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,410
我不是警察  费尔曼
I'm not a cop here, Fermin,

492
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,010
但如果你想要我帮你  你得告诉我
But if you want my help, you need to tell me

493
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,190
他落了什么在你车里
what he left in your cab.

494
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,010
一台手提电脑
He left a laptop.

495
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,630
他落在座位下面了
He left it underneath the seat.

496
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,590
肯定是忘了拿
He must have forgot.

497
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,330
你怎么处理的
What'd you do with it?

498
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,880
卖了
I sold it...

499
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,490
卖给一个朋友换钱了
to a friend for money.

500
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,840
我本来不是这种人  但是
Look, I never do that, but--

501
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,400
我载着他开了一天
I drive him around all day

502
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,070
然后他居然没付钱
and then he stiffed me on the tab.

503
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,970
-芬奇  你在吗  -永远都在  里瑟先生
- Finch, are you there? - Always, Mr. Reese.

504
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,860
看来普什科夫做了笔交易
Sounds like this Pushkov had some kind of a deal

505
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,600
把手提电脑卖给了爱沙尼亚帮
to sell the laptop to the Estonians.

506
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,240
但他却落在了出租车上
But then he leaves it in the cab?

507
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,650
他知道会有危险
He knew it would be dangerous.

508
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,510
他是想谈个更高的价钱
He wanted to negotiate a higher price.

509
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,710
显然  爱沙尼亚帮可没心情议价
Clearly, the Estonians were in no mood to negotiate.

510
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,790
那台手提电脑上会有什么东西
What in the world could be on that laptop?

511
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,490
-你在跟谁说话  -我的合伙人
- Who are you talking to? - My business partner.

512
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,460
爱沙尼亚帮不在乎手提电脑是不是在他手上
Estonians don't care if he doesn't have the laptop.

513
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,070
他们杀他是因为他知情
They'll kill him just because he knew about it.

514
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,430
就为了一台手提电脑
Just because of a laptop?

515
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,530
是为了手提电脑里的东西  把它找回
Because of what was on it, and getting it back

516
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,610
可能是保你小命的唯一筹码
may be the only leverage we have to keep you alive.

517
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,150
先从你负责出售的朋友开始
Let's start with the friend you sold it to.

Finch, looks like the Estonians have been here already.

529
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,550
阿齐兹
Aziz?

530
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,630
很遗憾  费尔曼
Sorry, Fermin.

531
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,560
是我把手提电脑卖给他的
I sold him the laptop.

532
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,610
是我害他被杀的
I got him killed.

533
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,190
-手提电脑还在吗  -应该不在了
- Is the laptop still here? - I don't think so.

534
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,110
他告诉我他今早找到了一个买家
He told me he found a buyer this morning.

535
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,200
他把钱分我了
He paid me my share.

536
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,230
曼索尔先生在被爱沙尼亚帮
Mr. Mansoor sold the laptop

537
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,410
杀害之前就卖掉了手提电脑
before his demise at the hands of the Estonians.

538
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,540
他们为了找电脑把这里翻了个底朝天
They trashed this place looking for it.

539
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,160
他们怎么找到这里的
How'd they know to come here?

540
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,050
普什科夫可能在电脑上装了
Pushkov may have installed a beacon

541
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,930
开机启动的指示器
that turns on when you power it up.

542
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,570
任何人只要有访问代码
Anyone with an access code

543
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,370
就能追踪它的位置
could follow it geographically.

544
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,680
而只要有人接触到那台电脑
And they're willing to kill anyone

545
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,210
他们就会杀了他
who comes in contact with it.

546
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,260
我黑进了阿齐兹的电子邮箱
I've gotten into Aziz's email account.

547
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,260
这里显示他把手提电脑卖给了
It appears that he sold the laptop

548
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,410
一个名叫D3MN8的线上买家
to an online buyer named "D3MN8."

549
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,870
有什么方法能找到他吗
Any way we can track him?

550
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,470
如果D3MN8发现了电脑上的东西
If D3MN8 discovers what's on the laptop,

551
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,760
他会尝试浏览文件
he may try to flip it.

552
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,030
在这种情况下  他可能会去地下网络
In which case, he'd probably go to the darknet,

553
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,130
在"丝绸之路"或者
try to sell it on Silk Road

554
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,920
其他黑市论坛卖掉它
or one of those black market forums.

555
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,860
我会试着追踪他
I'll try to track him down,

556
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,420
看能否安排一次会面
see if I can negotiate a meeting.

557
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
阿齐兹怎么办
What about Aziz?

558
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,350
纽约警方会很快到这里
The NYPD will be here shortly...

559
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,400
查出杀害你朋友的凶手
find out who did this to your friend.

560
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,410
我们还是走吧
We better get moving.

561
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,070
因为你就是他们下一个目标
'cause you're gonna be next.

562
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,850
让我猜猜
Let me guess,

563
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,740
那位司机招认了
your driver confessed

564
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,290
是他在公园里杀了那俄罗斯人
to killing the Russian in the park.

565
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,400
不尽然
Not exactly.

566
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,040
你想听好消息还是坏消息
You want the good news or the bad news?

567
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,160
先说好消息吧
Start with the good.

568
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,510
普什科夫是被爱沙尼亚黑帮杀的
Pushkov was killed by the Estonian mob.

569
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,560
他们在找他落在出租车上的手提电脑
They're chasing a laptop he left in our driver's cab.

570
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,070
所以特勤局的人才会蜂拥而至
Which explains the secret service swarming the body.

571
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,800
他们为什么迫切想得到那台手提电脑
Why do they want this laptop so bad?

572
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,090
还不清楚  可他们不惜
Don't know yet, but they're willing

573
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,480
杀死所有接触过的人
to kill anyone who comes in contact with it.

574
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,040
留意一个金发女人
Keep an eye out for a blonde.

575
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,710
她是负责人
She runs point for them.

576
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,170
我会调出爱沙尼亚帮的分析资料
I'll pull our analytical brief on the Estonians.

577
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,130
现在告诉我坏消息吧
Now, what's the bad news?

578
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,780
他们刚扔下另一具尸体
They just dropped another body.

579
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,170
我会短信发你地址
I'll text you the address.

580
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,140
我真不该拿走那台手提电脑
I never should have taken that laptop.

581
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,050
我就知道这整件事都是个错误
I knew this whole thing was a mistake!

582
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,560
不管我做什么  到头来都不对
No matter what I do, nothing seems to turn out right.

583
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,320
你是指  你是怎么决定
You mean, how you chose to get involved

584
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,970
和门多萨这样的走私贩扯上关系的
with a smuggler like Mendoza?

585
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,190
什么   门多萨是我们的联系人
Wh--Mendoza was our contact.

586
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,460
我们逃出来后
When we defected,

587
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,430
他就为我们这些棒球手安排好一切
he arranged everything for us ballplayers.

588
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,160
他把我们一路带到纽约
He brought us all the way to New York.

589
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,960
作为回报  你们挣的钱要分给他
In exchange, he takes a cut of your contract when you get paid?

590
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,600
门多萨说这是规矩
Mendoza said that's the way it worked.

591
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,700
他承诺得天花乱坠
He promises the moon.

592
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,770
我以为棒球  这个国家
I thought baseball, this country,

593
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,410
能让我赚到钱
was gonna make me rich,

594
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,400
可这个局
but this game...

595
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,720
你知道  取决于自己
you know, it lies to you.

596
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,590
你一受伤  就完了
And once you got injured, it was over.

597
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,820
打不了球  就赚不了钱
You can't play, you can't make money.

598
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,290
就变得无人问津
You become a nobody.

599
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
所以门多萨找到了另一条途径
So Mendoza figured he'd find another way

600
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,290
从你们身上吸金
to get his money out of you.

601
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,620
-你的家人  -对  他说他会帮我
- Your family. - Yeah, he said he'd help.

602
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,310
可现在他一味压榨我  毫不在乎
But now he's sticking it to me. He doesn't care.

603
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
有时我希望我从没离开古巴
Sometimes I wish that I'd never left Cuba.

604
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,850
你的所作所为很勇敢
You did a brave thing.

605
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,200
背井离乡  为家人谋求更好的生活
Leaving to find a better life for your family.

606
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,050
美国梦  不是吗
American dream, right?

607
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,800
找份好工作  买栋大房子
You get a good job, you buy a house.

608
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,220
我宁可全都不要  只要能再见家人一面
I'd trade all that in just to see my family one more time.

609
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,460
看着儿子长大  你知道吗
To see my son grow up, you know?

610
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,550
他几乎都不认识我了
He doesn't even know who I am anyway.

611
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,930
我可以帮你挽回  费尔曼
I can help you make things right, Fermin.

612
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,160
但你得信我
But you've got to trust me.

613
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,160
我还有选择吗
Do I have a choice?

614
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,830
你那个线人
This CI of yours...

615
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,700
他怎么知道爱沙尼亚帮杀了普什科夫
How does he know the Estonians killed Pushkov?

616
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,870
他们在找他带的一台手提电脑
They're hunting a laptop he had on him.

617
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,750
你知道里面有什么吗
You know what's on that thing?

618
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,710
-你知道吗  警探  -还不知道
- Do you, Detective? - Not yet.

619
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,460
可我有很强的预感
But I'm getting a strong premonition

620
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,090
里面的东西会让政府颇为尴尬
that whatever it is, it can embarrass the government.

621
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,140
我说得对吗
Am I right?

622
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,700
我只想帮忙
Look, I'm only trying to help.

623
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:01,210
瓦蒂姆・普什科夫是名独来独往的黑客高手
Vadim Pushkov was a lone wolf hacker extraordinaire.

624
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,080
机密

625
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,440
五年前我们第一次注意到他
We first noticed him five years ago.

626
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,240
他偷了了十万个信用卡账号
He stole over 100,000 credit card numbers.

627
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,460
他第二次出现时
The next time he turned up,

628
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,440
侵入了内华达的无人机引航站
he hacked into a drone pilot station in Nevada

629
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,910
把飞行控制加密协议在线出售给了
and sold the flight control encryption protocol online

630
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,470
一个巴基斯坦的买家
to a buyer in Pakistan.

631
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,150
这么说他再次出现了
So, he showed up on your radar again,

632
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,690
你们希望在他出售所窃资料前抓住他
and you guys hoped to catch him before he sold whatever he stole.

633
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,220
问题是  我们不知道
Problem is, we have no idea

634
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,910
普什科夫这次黑到什么了
what Pushkov was up to this time.

635
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,560
要是那台手提电脑
Afraid to even think about what would happen

636
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,780
未知号码信息
HTSC电脑店
第九东大街 3424号

637
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,800
误入敌手  后果不堪设想
if the contents of that laptop slipped into the wrong hands.

638
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,810
你跟我来吧
You might want to come with me.

639
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,260
去哪里
Where are we going?

640
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,310
在东村的一家电脑店发现一具尸体
Body dropped at a computer store in the East Village.

641
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,520
最后卖出那台手提电脑的人
Last guy to sell the laptop.

642
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,450
里瑟先生  我还在继续搜寻D3MN8
Mr. Reese, my search for D3MN8 continues.

643
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,970
不过我想我已经发现了
But I think I may have discovered

644
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,990
普什科夫手提电脑上的东西
what was on Pushkov's laptop.

645
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,190
是什么  芬奇
What is it, Finch?

646
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,130
卡特警探说
Detective Carter said

647
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,040
他们发现普什科夫在肯尼迪机场
they found a $275 receipt on Pushkov

648
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,950
短期停车的面值275块钱的收据
for short-term parking at JFK.

649
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,780
275块
$275?

650
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,420
没看出来是短期
Nothing short-term about that.

651
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,160
对  他没有飞往任何地方
No, and he wasn't flying anywhere.

652
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,680
所以如果奥多涅斯听到他说"H说"
So if Ordonez heard him say "H-said",

653
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,150
可能他是在说
It's possible that he's speaking about

654
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,140
国土安全局自动身份识别数据库
the Homeland Security automated identification database.

655
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,310
应该是他偷了
My best guess is he stole information

656
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,590
大量乘客的信息  其中包括
on a huge number of travelers:

657
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,810
地址  联调局清关数据  生物识别数据
Addresses, FBI clearances, biometric data.

658
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,230
就是说他们可以随意
Means they could sneak whoever they wanted

659
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,730
盗用任何人的信息入境
directly into the country using stolen credentials.

660
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,020
恐怖分子会想拿到这些数据
Terrorists could get their hands on this.

661
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,190
无人了解的情况下  漏洞才有价值
A breach like that only has value if no one knows about it.

662
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,790
因此他们要杀死
Which is why they're killing everybody

663
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,750
所有接触过手提电脑的人
that comes in contact with the laptop.

664
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,700
我的怀疑得到了证实
My suspicions are confirmed.

665
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,940
我在D3MN8常用的黑暗网络
I found the laptop listed

666
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,380
聊天频道发现了所列笔记本
on a darknet IRC channel frequented by D3MN8.

667
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,520
他要价五万美金
He's trying to sell it for $50,000.

668
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,670
他发现了他手里的东西
He's discovered what he's got in his hands

669
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,590
以及其中的价值
and what it's worth.

670
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,650
如果他能活下去的话
If he lives that long.

671
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,840
我会前去交易  安排会面
I'll try to make a buy, set up a meet.

672
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,710
里瑟先生  我设法和黑市上的D3MN8
Mr. Reese, I've managed to connect with D3MN8

673
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,930
取得了联系
on the black market.

674
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,890
我们已经商定好了笔记本的价格
We've agreed on a price for the laptop.

675
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,190
我正给你发送
Sending you the address now

676
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,720
我约他见面的交易地址
to meet up with him for the buy.

677
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,160
这是什么地方
What is this place?

678
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,230
芬奇  这里没人
Finch, there's no one here.

679
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,050
这里是空的
This place is empty.

680
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,410
什么意思  空的
What do you mean, empty?

681
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,650
屋里只有我们两个人
We may be the only ones in this room...

682
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,190
但并非只有我们
But we're not alone.

683
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,520
有人在监视我们
We're being watched.

684
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,070
我是弗斯科
Fusco.

685
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,290
鲍曼会过去接你
Bowman will swing by and pick you up.

686
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,650
你们俩拿上包裹  按计划送达
You two will get the package, deliver it as planned.

687
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,960
听着  我想过了
Hey, listen, I've been thinking about this.

688
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,920
我做不到
I can't do it.

689
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,720
我得自保
I got to keep my nose clean...

690
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,850
我被抓了对你也没什么好处
because I'm no good to you locked up.

691
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,440
我肯定我们会为你
I'm sure we'd find something for you

692
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,620
找到事做  莱奈尔
to do with yourself, Lionel.

693
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,290
另外  这样你对我也没什么好处
Besides, you're not that much good to me as it is.

694
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,790
不行  抱歉  我做不到
No, I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

695
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,050
不行  好吧  莱奈尔
No? Okay, Lionel.

696
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,470
你自寻死路
You've sealed your fate.

697
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,560
未知发件人
多数事故不需要用到工具

698
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,660
失踪

699
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,890
格里福尼  今晚

700
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,850
里瑟先生  我刚收到D3MN8发来的信息
Mr. Reese, I've just had a message from D3MN8.

701
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,090
他取消了买卖
He's called off the sale.

702
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,530
显然  他不喜欢你的样子
Apparently, he doesn't like the way you look.

703
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,200
我的样子有什么问题
What the hell's wrong with the way I look?

704
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,850
他说你样子像联调局的
He says you look like a Fed.

705
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,460
他叫停了交易
He's voided the transaction.

706
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,390
那台手提电脑也许是我们
That laptop may be our only hope

707
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,250
拯救奥多涅斯的唯一希望
of getting Ordonez's life back.

708
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,190
D3MN8没他自以为的那么聪明
D3MN8 isn't as smart as he thinks he is.

709
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,820
现在他也危在旦夕
Now he's in grave danger too.

710
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,580
我通过摄像机反查了他的信号
I piggybacked on the signal from his camera

711
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,260
追踪到了他现在的方位
and traced it back to where he is right now.

712
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,130
他在杨松桌球房
I have an address at Yeongson Pool Hall.

713
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,880
我想爱沙尼亚帮的朋友们
I guess our Estonian friends

714
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,780
也在找D3MN8  芬奇
are looking for D3MN8 too, Finch.

715
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,280
我们要耽搁会儿了
We're gonna be delayed.

716
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,990
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

717
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,660
我可能得自己去见D3MN8了
I might have to meet D3MN8 on my own.

718
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,610
想出去兜兜风吗  走吧
Want to go for a ride? Come on.

719
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,270
喂  莱奈尔
Yes, Lionel?

720
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,060
在忙吗
This a bad time?

721
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,980
有点
Kinda.

722
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,890
我稍后回你电话
I'll call you back.

723
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,570
格里福尼  今晚

724
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,410
喂
Yeah?

725
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,640
行  好吧
Okay, fine.

726
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,980
你想什么时候办
What time you want to do this?

727
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,700
这是我们在电脑店
This is the security camera footage

728
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,210
拍到的监控录像
we took from the computer store.

729
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,030
阿齐兹・曼索尔带着手提电脑离开
We have Aziz Mansoor leaving with the laptop.

730
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,720
约45分钟后  他空手而归
About 45 minutes later, he returns without it.

731
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,330
没有笔记本  一定是给卖了
No laptop. He must have sold it.

732
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,300
可你看这里
But look at this.

733
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,100
-20分钟后  -档案里有她
- 20 minutes later... - She's in the file.

734
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,660
爱沙尼亚帮的头目  名叫伊莉娜・卡普
Estonian operator named Irina Kapp.

735
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,320
国际刑警六个月前发布了红色通缉令
Interpol issued a red notice on her six months ago.

736
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,960
她走出门  十分钟后
She walks out, ten minutes later,

737
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,230
曼索尔先生被乱枪打死
Mr. Mansoor dies in a hail of bullets.

738
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,790
我们的死亡天使
Our little angel of death.

739
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,070
干吗
Yeah?

740
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,160
我来见个人
I'm here to meet someone.

741
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,480
你是谁
Who are you?

742
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,920
来干吗
And what do you want?

743
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,860
我带了钱
I brought the money.

744
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,700
但你不是他
But you're not him.

745
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,460
-你不是D3MN8  -你怎么知道
- You're not D3MN8. - What do you know?

746
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,440
我知道他就坐在那边
I know that he's sitting right over there.

747
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,750
想要用手机来远程操控
And if he's gonna remotely monitor a wireless camera

748
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,620
摄像头
with his phone,

749
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,740
最好把IP地址加密工作做好
he should take better care to encrypt its IP address.

750
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,800
你最好不要轻举妄动
You don't want to do that.

751
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,780
谢谢
Thank you.

752
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,850
坐下
Platz.

753
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,490
-钱拿来看看  -我没做这过种事
- Let's see the money. - I'm new at this sort of thing.

754
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,830
不过我想应该让我先看看手提电脑
But I'm guessing I'm supposed to see the laptop first.

755
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,850
你不是爱沙尼亚帮的
You're not with the Estonians.

756
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,990
没错  我不是
No, I'm not.

757
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,620
你早前想买这台手提电脑
You tried to buy the laptop earlier.

758
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,040
不过我不喜欢你搭档的样子
But I didn't like the way your partner looked.

759
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,300
所以你就跟爱沙尼亚帮做个交易
So you arranged to make a deal with the Estonians,

760
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,730
以为他们出价会更高
thinking they would pay more.

761
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,110
你错了
You'd be wrong.

762
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,350
十万  小额票
100,000. Small bills.

763
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,770
你要价的两倍
Double your asking price.

764
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,360
条件呢
What's the catch?

765
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,660
条件  阿尔伯特
The catch... Albert,

766
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,530
就是你要马上离开

767
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,490
消失  至少一年内不再出现
disappear, and don't show your face for at least a year.

768
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,800
尤其是别回到你母亲住的皇后区
Especially not at your mom's house in Queens,

769
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,230
也就是你目前居住的地方
where you presently reside.

770
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,410
拿上钱  走得远远的
Take your money and go far, far away.

771
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:35,080
有帮穷凶恶极的人想要这台手提电脑
Some very bad people want that laptop.

772
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,820
一旦他们知道你见过那台
And if they know you've even seen it,

773
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,640
他们会杀了你
they will kill you.

774
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,420
这就是条件  阿尔伯特
So that's the catch, Albert.

775
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,350
那你为什么想要
Then why would you want it?

776
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,120
这就不劳你费心了
Let me worry about that.

777
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,160
拿上你的钱
Take your money.

778
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,070
马上走
Go. Now.

779
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,930
抱歉  芬奇  刚有点事要处理
Sorry, Finch. Got distracted.

780
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,460
桌球房在哪  你拿到手提电脑了吗
Where's the Pool Hall? Did you get the laptop?

783
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,430
不过恐怕你得赶紧过来
But I'm afraid you'd better come rather quickly.

784
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,340
你好像拿了我的东西
I think you have something that belongs to me.

785
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,120
打开看过了吗
Did you open it?

786
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,370
没必要  我知道里面有什么 
I don't have to. I know what's on it.

787
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,340
我不会让你拿走它的
And I know I'll never let you take it.

788
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,820
无论如何都不行
At any price.

789
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,680
我喜欢男人戴眼镜
I do like men with glasses.

790
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,320
真遗憾
Too bad.

791
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,770
打死那只狗
Shoot the dog.

792
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,730
要我就不会那么做  各位
I wouldn't do that, fellas.

793
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,310
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese!

794

扔得高了
Little high...

796
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,830
偏了  不过好歹打到了

797
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,410
坐下  乖宝贝  乖宝贝

在哪
Where is it?

870
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,460
或许他能拿给我们
Maybe he can get it to us,

871
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,230
只要我们帮他解决一点事情
if we can help him out with something.

872

875

感觉肯定不错
It sure feels good.

880
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,380
确实
Yeah.

881
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,260
我自有妙招
I got my own bag of tricks.

882

883

不过我得问问你
But I have to ask you...

884
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,840
莱奈尔最近是怎么了
what's going on with Lionel?

没什么

你说呢
You tell me.

891

他们知道我们冲他去的

892
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,360
我们被出卖了
We got double-crossed.

893
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,270

895
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,440

因为他们想让我给HR带个口信
