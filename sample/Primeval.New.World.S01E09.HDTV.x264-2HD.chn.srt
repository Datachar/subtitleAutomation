《远古入侵：新世界》第一季 第九集
Primeval:New World S01E09

10
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,250
老兄  你还好吧
Spider, are you okay?

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,700
看看这个
Check this.

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,750
什么鬼玩意儿
What the hell!

13
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,470
我一定要找到它  太神奇了
I got go find it. Damn it!

14
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,110
就这样  我去找  你拿着视频
Okay, I'll go find it., you got the vidoe out there.

15
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,190
让大家看到你望着天空发呆
I'm not sure it's good for company morale

16
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,270
对公司的士气没好处吧
for people to see you staring into space.

17
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,300
更别说你自己了
Not to mention your morale.

18
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,860
我没事
I'm doing okay.

19
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,010
那公司呢
And the company?

20
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,320
我想如果未来三个月  我能全力
Well, I think I can stave off bankruptcy

21
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,350
研发新产品  扩展销售渠道
if I devote myself full-time for the next three months

22
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,230
公司还是可以避免破产的
to updated product and aggressive sales calls.

23
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,140
你的热情还真挺鼓舞人心的
Well, your enthusiasm is inspiring.

24
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,440
谢谢
Thanks.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
事实我其实对鼓舞士气一点不在行
Truth is, I'm not much of a cheerleader.

26
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,580
那是安吉的长处
That was always Ange.

27
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,270
没她在身边帮忙感觉真怪
Doing this without her just feels weird.

28
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,210
你和她谈过了吗
Have you talked to her at all?

29
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,640
她不会回来的  如果你想问的话
She's not coming back, if that's your question.

30
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,830
你想找人代替她吗
Do you have a plan to replace her?

31
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,260
你知道我的意思
You know what I mean.

32
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,140
她的工作
The job.

33
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,260
明白  我收到了一些简历
Yeah, I'm getting resumes.

34
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,050
可任何一个有头脑能接手她工作的人
But anyone smart enough to do that job

35
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,390
都会聪明到能发现
will be smart enough to find out that

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,890
旧的化学燃料库已经成了
that old chem bunker has been converted

37
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,000
我的恐龙狩猎队总部了
into the headquarters of my dinosaur-hunting team.

38
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,410
这样只会让我们更具吸引力
Well, that just makes us sound glamorous.

39
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,930
你跟迈可联系过吗
Have you called Mac?

40
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,680
没有
No.

41
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,230
过段时间再说吧
I'm giving it some time.

42
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,610
多久
How much?

43
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,690
我不知道
I don't know.

44
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,090
我是说  我又能做什么
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

45
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,070
给他打电话吗
Give him a call?

46
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,800
给他留言解释
Leave him a voice mail

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,160
我们之所以会成为朋友的真正原因
explaining that the real reason we're friends

48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,160
是在某个平行的时空
is that because in some alternate reality,

49
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,390
他穿越回去救了我的命吗
he went back in time and saved my life?

50
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,300
我想他被冻在地下室的身体
I think his frozen body in the basement

51
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,930
才是最难解释的部分吧
is actually the harder part to explain.

52
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,100
你会看成本报表吗
Do you know anything about cost reports?

53
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,270
完全看不懂
Not a damn thing.

54
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,980
伙计们
Hey, guys?

55
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,820
我们有麻烦了
We got a problem.

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,800
恐龙出现了
A dinosaur problem?

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,730
三角龙算吗
A triceratops?

58
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,750
出现在西温哥华呢
In west van?

59
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,010
成本报表的事看来得推迟了
Looks like the cost reports will have to wait.

60
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,180
等等  你怎么知道是哪种恐龙
Wait, how do you know what kind of dinosaur?

61
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,350
转给他人  分享此链接

62
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,440
看到点击量了吗
Did you notice the hit count?

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,210
我刚上来的时候还不到九千
When I first came upstairs, it was under 9,000.

64
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,020
现在超过三万五千次了
Now it's over 35,000.

65
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,790
不少人在关注啊
That's a lot of eyeballs.

66
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,350
会不会是恶搞呢
No chance it's a hoax?

67
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,460
不  我很清楚原创动画社区
No, I'm pretty plugged in to the homebrew animation community.

68
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,320
这个不是假的
This isn't a fake.

69
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,220
视频名称"骇人真恐龙"
This is a "Freaking' real dino."

70
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,380
是今天拍的吗
And it was taken today?

71
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,290
几个小时之前
A couple of hours ago.

72
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,180
我装了个数据包嗅探器
I've got a sniffer

73
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,260
监控所有和恐龙有关的信息
running on all dino stuff.

74
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,010
早些时候发现了它
I caught it early.

75
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,370
数以千计的人点击了这个恐龙视频
So a few thousand people click on a dinosaur video,

76
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,600
点击量介于"弹钢琴的猫"
in between piano-playing cat

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,950
和"本周美颜植物"之间
and faceplant-of-the-week.

78
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,980
没人会当真的
No one'll take it seriously.

79
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,960
我不担心新加坡的网友
I'm not worried about some guy in Singapore

80
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,160
把视频推给自己的朋友
tweeting it to his friends.

81
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,820
我担心的是有本地人认出这个滑板场
I'm worried about locals recognizing that skate park

82
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,480
然后跑去一看究竟
and going out there to check it out.

83
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,140
你能删掉这个视频吗
Can you take this down?

84
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,660
不费功夫  我在删了
Yeah, with a little effort. I mean, I'm on it.

85
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,460
我去拿装备
I'll grab the gear.

86
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,220
我们过去看看
Let's get out there.

87
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,350
异常点探测器怎么样了
What's the status on the anomaly detector?

88
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,050
大概还要修半天的时间才能运作
Oh, we're still 12 hours away from operational.

89
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,330
有什么我可以帮忙的吗
Any way I can help?

90
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,670
没有

91
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,430
我们能搞定
We'll be okay.

92
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,490
我们一到那附近之后
Once we're in the general vicinity,

93
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,060
这个便携探测器会带我们找到具体方位
the handheld can get us the rest of the way.

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,910
迈可呢  要打电话给他吗
What about Mac? Are we going to call him?

95
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,840
不用
No.

96
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,940
让他静一静吧
Let's leave him alone.

97
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,340
好吧
Okay.

98
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,520
不知道这些能不能对付一只成年三角龙
Not sure how much these'll do against a full-grown triceratops.

99
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,880
它比我们之前所见的史前生物都巨大
This is bigger than anything we've been up against before.

100
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,460
这话安慰人
That's comforting.

101
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,070
它是被捕食的动物
It's a prey animal.

102
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,310
食草生物
A herbivore.

103
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,560
较好的情况是  如果它能找到安全的地方
There's a good case that it'll just den down,

104
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,120
它就会藏起来
if it can find a safe spot.

105
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,320
一个有水有食物的地方
Somewhere with edible plants and water.

106
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,500
只要它不向我吐有致幻蘑菇成分的口水
Just so long as it doesn't spew magic mushrooms all over me,

107
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,570
就行了
I'm good.

108
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,730
就是那儿
There.

109
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,610
就在棒球场那边
Just past the baseball diamond.

110
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,350
它当时就在那儿
That's where it was.

111
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,750
或许我们可以追踪到它的踪迹
Maybe we can pick up its trail.

112
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,840
知道是谁拍的视频了
I think we know who shot the footage.

113
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,510
你还好吗
You all right?

114
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,390
挺好
I'm good, man.

115
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,850
你就是那个拍"骇人真恐龙"的人吧
You're the freakin' real dino guys, right?

116
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,230
是啊  很酷吧
Yeah, cool, huh?

117
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,950
要我在你衣服上签名吗
Want me to sign your shirt?

118
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,550
你们知道它朝哪个方向去了吗
You guys know which way it went?

119
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,950
我想去追它  但它跑了
I tried going after it, but it was gone.

120
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,480
埃文
Evan...

121
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,230

事情越来越麻烦了
This thing's getting out of hand.

124
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,230
越来越麻烦是什么意思
What do you mean "Getting"?

125
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,370
这段视频已经被数家网站转载
The video is mirrored on over a dozen different websites.

126
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,580
"骇人真恐龙"在推特上疯传
"Freaking real dino" is trending on twitter.

127
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,690
我总不能把整个网络和当地新闻都封锁吧
I can't shut down the whole internet and the local news.

128
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,820
好吧

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,410
磁力计在这个方向上有波动
I'm getting a reading from this direction.

158
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,190
这下可好  那边人群涌动我们都还不知所措
Great. We've left the crowd behind,

159
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,430
现在又要擅闯私人领地了
and now we're trespassing.

160
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,060
为什么有人会觉得需要
Why is it that some people feel they need

161
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,260
一千平米大的私人地盘呢
10,000 square feet of personal space?

162
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,990
首先这附近住着不少高科技人才
Well, a lot of tech guys live in this area.

163
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,610
而且我们原本也不乐于交际
We're not the most sociable bunch to begin with.

164
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,460
围栏是从里面被推倒的
This is pushed outward.

165
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,410
这里看来
It looks like there are tracks here

166
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,520
有来回走动过的痕迹
going back and forth.

167
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,740
也许主人去度假了
Well, maybe they're on vacation.

168
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,530
我们几时这么走运了
When do we ever get that lucky?

169
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,040
异常点应该就在拱门那边
The anomaly should be just past that arch somewhere.

170
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,150
这是哪门子的地址啊
What kind of address is that?

171
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,680
"阿尔法"
"Alpha."

172
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,700
希腊语的第一个字母
The first letter of the Greek alphabet.

173
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,000
这可不算是地址  除非这里的主人
That's not an address, unless the guy who lives here

174
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,950
是想郑重声明他在同类中
is trying to make a serious statement

175
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,120
至高无上的地位
about his position in the pack,

176
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,380
如此说来  他每天早上
in which case, peeing on the door

177
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,740
在门口尿一泡岂非更省事
every morning might be quicker.

178
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,630
阿尔法是一切表示光谱精细结构常数的标志
It's the symbol for the fine structure constant of the universe,

179
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,700
可出现在这里就不是好事了
and that right there is bad news.

180
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,770
为什么
Why?

181
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,220
这房子是霍华德・凯纳恩的
This place belongs to Howard Kanan.

182
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,900
那家伙是个传奇人物
Guy's a legend.

183
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,770
在移动通信和医学成像
Key patents in mobile communications,

184
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,820
以及油田遥感技术领域
medical imaging,

185
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,300
拥有核心专利
remote oil-field sensing--

186
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,530
他涉足的每一个领域
Every arena he worked in,

187
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,450
都硕果累累
he was brilliant.

188
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,990
公认的天才
Certifiable genius.

189
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,970
天才
Genius?

190
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,590
比如他能明白异常点探测器工作原理吗
Like he could understand how that thing works?

191
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,870
我们得尽快找到那只恐龙
We've got to find that creature

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,890
在被凯纳恩发现以前把它弄走
and get it out of here before Kanan sees it.

193
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,260
假如他知道了  他一定想参与
If he knew, he'd want in.

194
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,810
你知道只要妨碍他的公司
Do you know that he buried

195
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,720
都被他一一击溃了吗
every single company that got in his way?

196
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,680
你很了解他
You know a lot about him.

197
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,560
是啊  我们打过交道
Yeah, we've crossed paths.

198
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,720
我能保住公司算是佛祖庇佑了
I'm lucky I still have my company.

199
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,800
埃文・克劳斯
Evan Cross!

200
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,960
你个鬼鬼祟祟的贼
You thieving prick.

201
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,500
原来你们认识
So, you two know each other.

202
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,460
打官司认识的
Mostly from court.

203
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,330
他想告我专利侵权
He tried to sue me for patent infringement,

204
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,090
但他无凭无据
but he didn't have a case.

205
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,150
我输了  不代表我错了
I lost. Doesn't mean I'm not right.

206
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,360
你是哪位
And, uh, you are...?

207
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,630
狄伦・威尔
Dylan Weir.

208
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,270
我什么专利都没有
I don't hold any patents.

209
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,590
你们怎么跑到我家来了
Why are you on my property?

210
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,560
观察鸟类
Bird watching.

211
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,750
我听说这一带有个稀有的品种
I heard there was a rare specimen out here.

212
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,190
喜欢在水边栖息
Likes to roost near water.

213
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,910
那是黑蛎鹬
Would that be the black oyster-catcher

214
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,840
还是长喙麻鹬呢
or the long-billed curlew?

215
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,220
是隐居鸫
Hermit thrush.

216
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,740
专业  我喜欢
You, I like. Conditionally.

217
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,030
你呢  克劳斯
How about you, Cross?

218
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,400
你是来看鸟  还是来偷鸟
You here to watch the birds or just steal them?

219
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,530
我觉得是时候
You know what, I think it's about time

220
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,610
把我们之间的误会弄个水落石出了
you and I straightened out this whole misunderstanding.

221
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,580
光电电路不是你首创的
You did not pioneer photonic circuitry.

222
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,690
是我
I did.

223
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,460
我哪里误会了
So which part am I misunderstanding?

224
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,450
是我发明的  被他剽窃了
I invented it, and he stole it.

225
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,290
如果你感兴趣  我可以向你证明
If you'd like, I can prove it.

226
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,430
他证明不了
He can't prove that.

227
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,620
不  我可以
Yes, I can.

228
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,510
进来吧
Come on in.

229
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,180
等等  如果你觉得你有证据
Hang on, if you think you have proof,

230
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,800
应该让我看个清楚
I should be the one that you show.

231
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,740
有事给我打电话
Call me if you need anything.

232
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,910
你也是
Back at you.

233
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,890
他怎么可能没空
How can he be busy?

234
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,180
除非有飞碟降落在市中心了
Unless a flying saucer has landed downtown,

235
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,160
我们才是磁石项目唯一的任务
we're the only thing that Project Magnet does!

236
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,430
好  很好  太好了
Yeah, great, awesome.

237
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,990
你何不再给他转达一下
Why don't you give him another message?

238
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,640
迈可
Mac!

239
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,680
你好  托比
Hey, Tobes.

240
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,590
我们还真是不来电啊  是吧
Wow, affection really doesn't work for us, does it?

241
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,560
我心里是爱你的
I love you on the inside.

242
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,500
埃文呢
Where's Evan?

243
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,520
我得跟他好好谈谈
We need to have a serious chat.

244
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,700
他又出去抓恐龙了
He's on another dino-hunt,

245
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,170
而且这回温哥华所有爱围观的都出动了
along with every other lookie-loo in Vancouver.

246
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,960
这么说恐龙的秘密终究纸包不住火了
So the dinosaurs are finally out of the bag?

247
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,660
是啊  我还得想办法
Yeah, and I have to figure out a way

248
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,590
把这件事遮掩过去
to put them back in the bag,

249
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,130
可我已经黔驴技穷了
But I don't have a bag.

250
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,910
利兹上尉不见人影  安吉辞职
Leeds is AWOL, Ange quit,

251
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,810
埃文和狄伦在外头刺激有趣
Evan and Dylan are doing the fun stuff,

252
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,380
我要是想不到办法解决这事
and if I don't figure out a way to stop this,

253
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,360
就要面对一大群人
then we're going to have a lot of people

254
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,660
问得我们哑口无言
asking a lot of questions that we don't want to answer.

255
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,690
比如"为什么我的身体在冷冻室"吗
Like, "Why my body is in a freezer?"

256
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,310
原谅我对你的
Forgive me if I'm having trouble

257
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,720
公关难题无动于衷
getting worked up about public relations,

258
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,580
我都不确定自己到底是死是活
but I'm not sure if I'm alive or dead.

259
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,120
你这是干什么
What was that?

260
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,980
你还活着
You're alive.

261
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,400
那楼下怎么还冷冻着一个我
So how can I be downstairs on ice?

262
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,920
拜托  你现在真的想听我讲
Oh, come on, do you really want a discourse

263
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,480
关于时间平移相对论的长篇大论吗
in comparative theory of time displacement?

264
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,350
你能概括一下吗
Can you summarize?

265
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,770
冷冻室的那个人不是你  迈可
That's not you in the cryo chamber, Mac.

266
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,310
你就是你
You are you.

267
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,420
我不是  我是埃文创造的我
No, I'm not. I'm Evan's me,

268
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,690
是那个被他带离了
The version he created

269
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,920
自己的那个人生  带到这里
when he pulled me out of that life

270
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,840
而创造出的我
and brought me here.

271
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,790
跟我来
Well, come on.

272
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,790
什么
What?

273
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,320
去哪儿
Where?

274
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,180
别瞎看
Keep your eyes to yourself.

275
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,600
霍华德
Howard?

276
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,030
你这样生活多久了
How long have you been living like this?

277
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,810
怎样生活
Like what?

278
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,260
靠垃圾食品过活
Like a... junk food survivalist?

279
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,420
尽量减少消遣
Minimizing my distraction

280
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,690
我才能专注于新发明
so I can focus on my next innovation.

281
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,040
谐频方面的
In harmonics?

282
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,370
我带你来不是为了让你剽窃更多的专利
I didn't bring you in here so you could steal more patents.

283
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,590
我也没想剽窃
All right, that makes two of us.

284
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,980
你所谓的证据在哪里
So what's your so-called proof?

285
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,280
看到没
See?

286
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,750
可行的  光电
Operational... photonics.

287
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,920
当初我已经在决定生产规格了
I was working on the manufacturing specs

288
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,300
你却突然冒了出来
when you came out of nowhere.

289
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:58,990
三个月内快速上马
Geared up in three months,

290
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,910
在所有人反应过来之前
cornered the worldwide market

291
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,880
就已经垄断了全球市场
before anyone knew what happened.

292
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,460
生意如战场
It's just business.

293
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,690
很多人都在做同类的研究
A lot of people were doing parallel research.

294
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,550
是啊
Yeah.

295
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,100
没错  有这个可能
Sure, maybe.

296
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,110
而你恰好就取得了突破性进展
And you just happened to have the breakthrough.

297
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,030
是的  确实
Yeah. I did.

298
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,170
那超导体不稳定的问题呢
And the fact that you couldn't use a uniform superconductor?

299
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,420
这一点你是怎么解决的
How did you solve that one?

300
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,950
用纳米导线如何
The nanowire?

301
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,130
然后在外表镀上一层金
Coated that with gold.

302
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,650
这个办法的确巧妙
That's a cute trick.

303
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,070
我的团队对每一种可能都做了生产检测
But I had teams running manufacturing tests on every option.

304
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,930
历经了20个月的试验
After 20 months of trials,

305
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,460
我们终于把范围缩小到一种解决方案上
we were finally narrowing in on a solution,

306
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,300
结果一声霹雳
And boom!

307
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,140
埃文・克劳斯凭空出现
Evan Cross comes in out of nowhere,

308
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,770
不经任何实验就直接投入生产
and you go into production without one single trial?

309
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,020
这你怎么解释
How do you explain that?

310
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,110
我没必要解释
I don't have to explain it.

311
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,230
-去查我的专利文件  -我查了
- Check my patents... - I did!

312
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,490
它恰好说明你了解准确的方法
And what it shows is that you knew the right answer.

313
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,430
从一开始就知道
Right from the beginning,

314
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,570
完全没有人力投入
no sweat equity at all.

315
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,940
难不成  是你梦到的吗
So... It come to you in a dream?

316
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,580
不是不可能
It happens.

317
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,220
对  不是不可能  本来无可厚非
Yes, it does. Most definitely.

318
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,960
问题是
But here's the thing.

319
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,030
如果你真那么聪明
If you're that brilliant,

320
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,760
是个了不起的天才
if you're that much of a genius,

321
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,140
这种巧合会接二连三
it would happen again and again.

322
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,650
但那之后
And since then...

323
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,010
却再无成就
nothing.

324
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,910
我没法理解
I don't understand.

325
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,410
要么你就是剽窃
Either you're a patent thief...

326
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,020
要么过去五年你所做的事情
or whatever you've been working on for the last five years

327
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,550
重要到
is so big you're keeping it...

328
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,370
得秘而不宣
what, under wraps?

329
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,720
也许只是天不遂人愿
Or maybe things just didn't go as expected.

330
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,160
是不是只有一线之差
There's a bright line, isn't there?

331
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,740
然后物是人非
Between then and now.

332
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,600
本来满怀希望
Between everything's so full of promise...

333
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,460
转眼一切都黯淡无光
and everything's whole dark.

334
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,750
霍华德
Howard?

335
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,190
你是怎么了
What happened to you?

336
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,390
你有这么大的宅子
You've got this huge house,

337
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,420
自己却窝在这里
and you're holed up in here,

338
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,910
心有不甘
obsessing over what went wrong.

339
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,110
也许只是
Maybe things...

340
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,890
天不遂人愿
just didn't go as I expected.

341
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,360
埃文
Evan.

342
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,840
我在外边的游泳池旁
I'm out by the pool.

343
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,340
你得过来看看这个
You've got to see this.

344
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,820
失陪
Excuse me.

345
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,910
我得去看看我朋友
I have to check on my friend.

346
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,640
观察鸟的那位
The birdwatcher?

347
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,280
我以为你会告诉我
I've thought you're gonna tell me

348
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,690
她究竟是在找什么
what she's actually looking for?

349
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,210
你不会明白的
You wouldn't understand.

350
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,030
如果他不在这儿
If this wasn't here,

351
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,880
即使埃文告诉你  你会相信他吗
would you have believed Evan even if he did tell you?

352
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,290
你是说他为了我才保守秘密
You're saying he kept it for me?

353
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,650
我不知道
I don't know.

354
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,610
不过如果他打算永远保守这个秘密
But, I mean, if he planned on keeping this a secret forever,

355
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,100
收藏着你的尸体可是很愚蠢的
then storing your body was a pretty stupid move,

356
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,380
埃文・克劳斯可不蠢
and Evan Cross isn't stupid.

357
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,560
他偷走了我的人生
He stole my life.

358
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,420
他救了你的命
He saved your life,

359
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,570
他还准备好要以死相救
and he was ready to die to do it.

360
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,980
仔细想一想
Think about it.

361
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,580
他改变你未来的那一刻
The moment he changed your future,

362
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,930
他一定知道未来的你没办法
He must have known that your future self wouldn't be there

363
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,130
阻止恐龙杀了他
to stop him from getting killed by a dinosaur.

364
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,660
如果当初不是我救他  他怎么还活着
So if I wasn't there to save him, why isn't he dead?

365
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,950
我不知道
I don't know.

366
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,620
而且我也不在乎
And you know what, I don't care,

367
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,730
因为你俩都活着
because you're both alive,

368
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,140
如果他这么做才有的这个结果
and if what he did is responsible for that,

369
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,820
那我很高兴他那么做了
then I'm glad that he did it.

370
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,550
因为众多选择里
Because of the choices available,

371
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,430
这个显然是最好的
this one's a hell of a lot more fun.

372
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,680
那你认为那个我是从何而来
So where do you suppose "I" came from?

373
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,800
明显是从某个异常点里来的
Out of an anomaly, apparently.

374
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,840
那一定是我以前的工作
So that must have been my job then.

375
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,210
拯救生命
Saving people?

376
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,600
我是说我穿着制服呢
I mean, I'm wearing a uniform.

377
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,680
迈可  那些实在是无从得知了
That's not really that much to go on, Mac.

378
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,320
这里的每个人似乎都认为你很聪明
Everyone around here seems to think you're pretty clever.

379
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,350
我打赌只要你花点心思就能搞清楚
I'll bet you could figure out what that arc symbol means

380
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,460
那个圆弧标志的意思了
if you put your mind to it.

381
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,550
我也许会考虑帮你
I might consider helping you.

382
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,440
只要你帮我过了三角龙那一关
But only if you help me put the triceratops back in the bottle.

383
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,880
我也许有办法
Well, I might have an idea about that.

384
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,650
看看我发现了什么
Look at what I found.

385
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,680
很好
Great.

386
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,050
我们只要弄清楚它要去哪就行了
Now we just need to find out where it goes.

387
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,950
交给我了
I've got this.

388
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,340
你去找异常点吧
You get that.

389
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,240
那个疯子呢
Where's crazy eyes?

390
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,240
在屋里
Inside...

391
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,490
抱着悔恨  颓废不堪
with his powerbars and regret.

392
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,220
它是不是美得难以置信
Isn't it magnificent?

393
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,010
真没想能有机会好好地观察恐龙
I've never had a chance to just sit and watch one.

394
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,390
埃文  别这样
Evan, come on.

395
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,170
不是所有恐龙都杀人不眨眼
They're not all vicious killers.

396
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,260
这一只没有危害
This one doesn't mean any harm.

397
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,270
它只是
He's just...

398
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,570
来错了地方  仅此而已
out of place, is all.

399
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,640
怎么说它都挺危险
It's still dangerous.

400
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,550
看看它
Look at it.

401
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,960
体形比大象还大
The thing's bigger than an elephant,

402
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,270
还有那些角  像矛一样
and those horns, they're like spears.

403
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,050
更别提如果有人看到它
Not to mention the little problem we'd have

404
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,660
我们要怎么解释了
trying to explain it if someone else sees it.

405
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,410
别开枪
Wait.

406
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,620
我们不想会搬着它走的
We don't want to have to carry it.

407
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,120
快跑
Move!

408
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,900
这还真是一只硕大无比的隐居鸫啊
That's one hell of a hermit thrush.

409
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,030
就是这个  对吧
That's it, right?

410
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,460
就是这个了
I mean, this is it!

411
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,220
这就是过去五年来你一直
This is the big secret that you've been working on

412
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,570
在隐藏的秘密  对吗
for the last five years, right?

413
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,470
我猜对了吧
Am I right?

414
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,270
伟大的埃文・克劳斯的重大突破
The great breakthrough by the great Evan Cross!

415
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,280
不完全是
Not exactly.

416
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,340
这太令人震惊了
This is huge!

417
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,280
你又不是遗传工程学家  我的朋友
I mean, you're no genetic engineer, my friend,

418
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,990
也就是说那东西是来自于
which means that thing came...

419
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,130
遥远的过去
from a distant past.

420
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,770
我就知道你们有所隐瞒  对吧
I mean, I knew you guys were hiding something, right?

421
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,300
对吧  但是三角龙
Right, but triceratops?

422
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,590
太意外了
That wasn't even on the list!

423
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,330
我喜欢惊喜
And I love surprises!

424
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,350
它要是不危险  刚刚是怎么回事
What happened to that thing not meaning any harm?

425
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,730
我们一定是吓到它了
We must've frightened it.

426
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,620
或者它以为游泳池是它的家
Or else it thinks the pool is its home,

427
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,230
它不过是在守卫自己的领地
and it was just defending its territory.

428
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,470
我会找到它
I'll find it.

429
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,080
你去找异常点
You find the anomaly.

430
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,680
找异常点
Find the anomaly...

431
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,000
坏了吗
Is it dead?

432
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,490
是啊  可能需要抢救一下
Yeah, it might need a little CPR.

433
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,820
需要帮忙吗
Need help?

434
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
我回来了
I'm back.

435
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,300
这东西你从哪里弄到的
Where did you get it?

436
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,700
我做的
I built it.

437
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,470
不可能  它太精密了
No, it's way too sophisticated.

438
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,790
这是我的得意之作
It's a pet project.

439
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,260
你想让我相信
You want me to believe

440
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,380
你发现了穿越时空之门
that you found doorways through time,

441
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,810
但你这个惊人的秘密成果
and yet your breakthrough secret project

442
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,840
不是你从未来世界带来的吗
isn't something from the future?

443
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:13,950
没准是偷来的
Maybe stolen?

444
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,300
没准是从未来的我手里偷的
Maybe from my future?

445
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,310
没准是我自己手里呢
Or mine?

446
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,670
你直到这意味着什么吗
Do you realize the implications of that?

447
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,840
这验证了费恩曼关于
Confirmation of Feynman's postulate

448
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,840
美国著名物理学家

449
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,020
时间线分支的假说
of branching timelines.

450
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,580
这验证不了任何事
Look, nothing's been confirmed.

451
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,140
也不能作为你上法庭的证据
And this isn't going to help your case in court.

452
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,530
别提上庭了
Oh, forget court!

453
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,840
这个能拿诺贝尔奖
This is Nobel territory!

454
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,090
甚至超越了诺贝尔奖
Beyond Nobel territory!

455
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,060
霍华德  不行
Howard, no.

456
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,570
这个消息不能走漏
None of it can leave this room.

457
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,530
你开玩...
Are you k--

458
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,690
绝对不行
None of it.

459
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,800
好  你想要我三缄其口吗
Okay, you want my silence?

460
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,870
把真相告诉我
Tell me the truth.

461
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,260
别装了
Come on!

462
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,730
你保守这秘密一定很辛苦
This has got to be killing you!

463
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,360
你一定迫切想找个能理解你的人
You have to be desperate for someone to talk to

464
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,900
一吐为快
who can actually understand.

465
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,840
不  没有
No. Not really.

466
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,410
埃文
Evan...

467
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,800
知道这种事不能给予你力量
Knowledge like this isn't power.

468
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,350
而是孤立无援
It's isolation.

469
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,220
好的  南斯小姐
Yes, Miss Nance,

470
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,140
我保证向他传达你说的话
I'll be sure he gets the message.

471
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,930
请问是"三角龙"吗
Now, was that "Triceratops" with one "r?"

472
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,490
喂
Hello?

473
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,030
出来

474
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,860
迈可  你不是说会帮我的吗
Mac, I thought you were going to help me.

475
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,590
言出必行
And so I have.

476
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,570
这是什么东西
What the hell?

477
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,000
它叫尖尖
His name's Spikey.

478
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,340
你在这儿啊
There you are.

479
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,960
这次慢慢来
Slowly this time.

480
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,710
看见没
Yeah, see?

481
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,300
没什么好担心的
There's nothing to worry about.

482
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,670
你这是怎么了
What is going on with you?

483
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,590
你不能觉得这全都是你的地盘吧
You can't think all of this is your territory.

484
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
是因为红色
It's the red.

485
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,750
你以为我是敌人
You think I'm a rival.

486
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,210
我们再试一次
Let's try this again.

487
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,610
你只是被吓到了
You're just scared.

488
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,390
也难怪
Why wouldn't you be?

489
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:27,800
我只是要确保
I'm just going to make sure

490
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,510
你不会再惹上麻烦
you don't get into any more trouble.

491
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,570
这东西废了
This is fried.

492
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:37,750
要是我就会安个限幅器防止超负荷
I'd have put in a limiter to stop it from overloading.

493
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,800
是吗
Oh, really?

494
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,320
谢谢你的建议
Well, thanks for the advice.

495
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,100
你有这个吗
Do you have anything?

496
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:44,930
有
Yeah.

497
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,830
我可以给你替换的零件
Yeah, I've got something you could kludge in there.

498
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,850
让磁力计重新工作
Get it up and running.

499
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,870
但我有个条件
For a price.

500
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,070
这不是在开玩笑  霍华德
This isn't a joke, howard.

501
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,240
没开玩笑  这我明白
No, I get that.

502
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,260
事关时空的连续性
This is the space-time continuum.

503
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,460
有毁灭世界的可能
It has world-ending potential,

504
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,980
而你不想成为
and you don't want to be

505
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,990
下一个奥本海默
the next Oppenheimer.

506
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,990
原子弹之父

507
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,150
没错
Exactly.

508
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,020
那你为什么要掺和这事呢
So why are you messing with it?

509
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,500
我别无选择
I don't have a choice.

510
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,970
也许这些异常点很危险
As dangerous as these anomalies may be,

511
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,050
但还是把这些生物送回去的唯一途径
it's the only thing we have to put these creatures back.

512
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,600
你穿越过异常点吗
Have you ever been through one?

513
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,080
到另一个时空吗
To the other side?

514
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,320
是的
Yeah.

515
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,330
有过一两次
Once or twice.

516
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,190
那
And...

517
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,340
是不是很不可思议
was it amazing?

518
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,670
还很可怕
And frightening.

519
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,610
听着  我只是想把一切
Look, the only thing I'm trying to do

520
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,620
都送回原本属于的地方
is keep every single thing where it belongs.

521
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,230
你怎么管起这事了
How did that get to be your job?

522
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,470
记得你说的那句一线之差
You know that bright line you talked about

523
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,600
物是人非吗
between then and now?

524
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,010
我妻子被恐龙杀害的时候
That happened for me

525
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,840
也是一线之差
when a dinosaur killed my wife.

526
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,140
我能理解
I get that.

527
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,620
我妻子去世后
When my wife died...

528
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,090
如果我也能像你一样扛着步枪
if I could have gone after ovarian cancer

529
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,060
就能消灭卵巢癌
with your rifles...

530
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,140
我也会的
I would have.

531
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,790
埃文
Evan.

532
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,930
狄伦  你还好吧
Dylan. You all right?

533
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:36,920
不仅是还好
Better than all right.

534
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,730
还抓了只恐龙
I got me a dinosaur.

535
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,470
在哪儿
Where?

536
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,430
网球场
Tennis court.

537
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,970
我把它围在栅栏里了
The creature's fenced in,

538
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,360
当然它要是想逃跑栅栏也阻止不了
not that that'll matter if it decides to take off.

539
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,630
但我会去给它找些水和吃的
But I'm going to find it some food and water,

540
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,880
让它平静下来
get it to hunker down.

541
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,910
异常点探测器还有多久能弄好
How long till we've got an anomaly detector?

542
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,830
我们还在努力修
We're working on it.

543
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,220
动作快点
Work faster.

544
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,670
我得找到能塞满一校车的食物才够
I've gotta find enough food to fill a school bus.

545
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,400
收到
Roger that.

546
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,210
我得赶紧把这东西修好
I have to get this thing finished.

547
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,240
我们得在异常点关闭之前
We have to put that triceratops back through that anomaly

548
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,980
把三角龙送回去
before it closes.

549
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,830
还有多少时间
How long do you have?

550
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,400
不知道
No idea.

551
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,770
你不知道
You don't know?

552
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,570
我没有计时器
I don't have a timer.

553
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,510
我一直试着做一个  但是
I've been working on one, but--

554
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,780
埃文  我可以帮你
Evan, I can help.

555
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,180
要是你我联手
You and I working together,

556
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,310
没有什么解决不了的
there's very little we can't solve.

557
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,940
我想加入
I want in.

558
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,910
很好
Perfect.

559
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,280
我想我知道你喜欢吃什么
And I think I know what you like to eat.

560
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,370
它大约二十英尺高
It was, like, 20 feet tall,

561
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,620
有着巨大结实的角
with these big, massive horns,

562
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,030
还有...它在那儿
and-- there it is!

563
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,290
恐龙在那儿
There's the dinosaur!

564
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,400
不是吧
Oh no.

565
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,670
住手
Hey! Stop!

566
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,600
你们在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

567
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,090
狄伦  我不知道你已经在这里了
Dylan, I hadn't realized you were already on the scene.

568
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,050
我们在呢
Well, we are,

569
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,420
而且我已控制住了局势
and I have everything under control

570
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,260
让这些人走开好吗
if you'll just get these people to back off.

571
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,050
好吧  放下武器
Uh, yeah, uh, lower your weapons.

572
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,380
退后
And, um, pull back.

573
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,300
我是来帮忙的
I'm here to help.

574
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,920
但你是在帮倒忙  知道吗
Yeah, well, you're not helping, okay?

575
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,070
你要是在这里将它麻醉
If you tranq that thing here,

576
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,220
我们就得把它拉到异常点去
we're going to have to drag it all the way to the anomaly,

577
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,740
告诉你吧  我有经验
which, let me tell you from experience,

578
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,050
那比你想象的要难很多
is harder than you think.

579
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,280
我有一辆卡车
Yeah, I have a truck.

580
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,980
那不是重点
That's not the point.

581
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,340
这是一只温驯的动物
This is a docile animal,

582
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,110
它完全可以自己走回去
and it can move under its own power.

583
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,700
了解
Understood.

584
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,820
我以为托比让你
I thought that Toby sent you

585
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,750
去了滑板公园
to the skate park.

586
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,470
实况卫星图像显示了
Yeah, real-time satellite imagery revealed

587
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,410
这一带有巨大的流动热能
a remarkably large mobile heat signature on this property.

588
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:22,740
我是来
I'm here to offer

589
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,110
全力支持你的野外行动
full operational coordination with your field efforts.

590
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,540
我们目标一致
We are on the same team.

591
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,130
那我有个适合你的任务
Then I have just the job for you.

592
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,110
那道门
The portals,

593
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,520
你称之为异常点  是吧
you call them anomalies, right?

594
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,150
是的
Yeah.

595
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,020
你喜欢吗
You like that?

596
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,620
当然
Sure.

597
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,720
你认为这是它们的工作原理
Then this is your theory on how they work.

598
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,010
对  出现  磁场波动
Yeah, they appear, they fluctuate,

599
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,010
然后消失
they disappear.

600
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,440
有一定的规律
There's a pattern to it,

601
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,010
但每次都不一样
but it's different every single time.

602
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,630
我还没有算出
I haven't been able to figure out

603
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,350
它的傅里叶级数[一种特殊的三角级数]
the fourier series for it yet.

604
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,950
那是因为你的方向错了
That's because you're going about it wrong.

605
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,160
你想找到消失在混乱中的常量
You're trying to find a value lost in chaos.

606
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
但那是无法预测的
That can't be predicted.

607
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,710
说明白点
Elaborate on that.

608
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,170
如果它与重叠的正弦波无关呢
What if it's not about overlapping sine waves?

609
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,100
如果...
What...

610
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,100
让我解释清楚
Let me explain.

611
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,890
异常点  它们带有磁性  对吧
The anomalies, they're magnetic, right?

612
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,490
因此每次出现时
So every time they appear,

613
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,190
都会产生独一无二的磁特性
there's going to be a unique signature

614
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,100
因为它们会和地球磁场
caused by an interference

615
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,850
相互干扰
with the earth's magnetic field.

616
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,350
那就对了
Done.

617
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,000
所以你要预测的不是一个规律
So it's not a pattern you're trying to predict.

618
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,590
没错  是一条磁特性谐波
Of course. It's a harmonic signature.

619
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,310
对
Right.

620
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,120
我该测量的
It's not the standing field

621
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,890
不是固定磁场
I should be trying to measure.

622
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,490
而是初始磁力
It's the initial event.

623
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:31,280
就像一枚逐渐减弱的音符
It's like a musical note that fades.

624
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,720
对  当它减弱到临界点时
Yes, and when it decays past the critical threshold...

625
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,810
异常点就会关闭
The anomaly collapses.

626
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,440
完全正确
Exactly.

627
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,260
可以预测
Predictably.

628
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,130
那么我们需要做的
So all we need to do

629
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,250
就是将一个晶体悬空于基液之中
is suspend a crystal in a fluid matrix.

630
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,170
我们没有那么多时间
We don't have time for that.

631
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,750
我必须找到这个异常点
I have to find the anomaly.

632
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,310
但谢谢你  霍华德
But thank you, Howard.

633
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,020
谢谢
Thank you.

634
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,260
放那里
Just there.

635
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,660
等等
Excuse me.

636
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,790
等等
Excuse me!

637
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,060
你们这些人是在干什么
What the hell do you people think you're doing?

638
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,340
对不起  女士
I'm sorry, ma'am.

639
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,800
我有官方授权
I have official authorization

640
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,260
征用这些花朵
to commandeer these flowers

641
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,230
出于国家安全的原因
for reasons of national security.

642
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,940
但这些花我获过奖
But they're my prize-winning flowers!

643
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,100
是的  它们的确很美
Yes, I understand that they're beautiful--

644
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,960
各位  那些...
Gentlemen, that's--

645
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,090
那些够用了  谢谢  好极了
That's plenty. Thanks, great.

646
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:18,940
是的  就是...
Yup. Just...

647
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,090
女士  在这个混乱的年代
In these uncertain times, ma'am,

648
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,230
为了自由  我们都要有所牺牲
we all have to make sacrifices for freedom.

649
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,730
您今天漂亮极了
You look lovely today.

650
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,840
我的天啊
Oh, my goodness...

651
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,070
走
Go.

652
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,050
你觉得这样行吗
You think this will work?

653
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,940
比食物更有诱惑力的就只有性了
The only better lure than food is sex.

654
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,280
所言甚是
Yeah, truer words.

655
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,300
埃文一告诉我们异常点所在地
When Evan tells us where to go,

656
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,460
我们就很慢很温柔地  引它回去
we'll just walk it back, nice and slow.

657
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,230
没必要搞得那么刺激
There's no need for all that excitement.

658
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,960
这次终于不需要了
For once.

659
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,520
我的天啊
My god...

660
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,230
我的天啊
My god...

661
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:37,950
看哪
Look at--

662
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,860
霍华德  别太靠近
Howard, don't get too close.

663
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,140
看看碎片层
Look at the shard layer.

664
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,250
那是时空的边缘
It's the edge of space and time

665
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,110
被炸得四分五裂
just blown apart.

666
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,250
我想是因为
I think it's from the impact

667
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,920
四维表面的相互碰撞
of colliding four-dimensional surfaces.

668
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,310
它可能只是
I think it might just be

669
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,210
被人类肉眼看到的样子  但...
the way the human eye perceives it, but...

670
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,620
真美
it is beautiful.

671
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,690
是啊
Yeah...

672
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,550
这就是过去和现在的
It's the bright line

673
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,910
一线之差
between then and now.

674
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,730
可以让我来吗
May I?

675
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,480
好的
It's okay.

676
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,160
你的计时器  先生
Your timer, sir.

677
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,340
你怎么这么快就做好了
How did you make that so quickly?

678
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,780
我只是在我花了一年多时间
I just tweaked a resonator

679
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,340
研究的共振仪上稍做改动
I've been working on for over a year.

680
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,600
简直像是宿命一般
It's almost like it was destiny.

681
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,730
成功了
And it works.

682
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,580
我们只剩不到两分钟了
And we have less than two minutes.

683
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,660
两分钟  你确定吗
Two minutes? You're sure?

684
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,900
一分五十秒
A minute and 50 seconds.

685
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,380
假如这东西精确的话
Assuming this thing is accurate.

686
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,930
计算误差大约在十万分之六上下
The calculated margin for error is .006%, give or take.

687
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,670
你在哪里
Where are you?

688
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,260
保龄球场往东两百米
Uh, 200 metres east of the Bowling Green.

689
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,980
我九十秒后到达
Be there in 90 seconds.

690
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,800
你干什么  你要去哪里
What are you doing? Where are you going?

691
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,320
去异常点  没时间解释了
Anomaly. No time to explain.

692
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,550
我能帮你什么吗
How can I assist?

693
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,430
快闪开  小龙要回家了
Get out of the way. This baby's going home!

694
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,300
这是在模仿斗牛士的斗篷吗
Is this analogous to a bullfighter's cape?

695
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,720
其实公牛是色盲
Because bulls are colour-blind.

696
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,580
他们更容易被...
They're more attracted to--

697
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,820
闭嘴
Shut...up.

698
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,410
埃文
Evan!

699
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,470
只剩十五秒了
It's 15 seconds.

700
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,380
她赶不过来的
She's not gonna make it.

701
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,080
她会赶上的
She will.

702
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,210
小心
Look out!

703
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,990
小心
Look out!

704
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,200
-还有几秒钟时间  -你还好吗
- And with seconds to spare. - You okay?

705
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,890
霍华德
Howard--

706
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,070
再见了
Goodbye.

707
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,980
那人是谁
Who was that?

708
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,150
他来多久了
How long has he been here?

709
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,500
友善点
Be nice.

710
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,860
他为给大家伙找吃的出了不少力
He was very helpful getting fodder for the big guy.

711
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,070
刚刚那个男人  他去哪儿了
There was a man here. Where did he go?

712
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,380
他是霍华德・凯纳恩  你知道他去了哪
It was Howard Kanan. And you know where he went.

713
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,140
这情况有意思
Interesting development.

714
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,240
他为什么那么做
Why would he do that?

715
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,850
不知道
I don't know.

716
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,920
出于好奇  自负  或愚蠢至极
Curiosity? Arrogance? Complete stupidity?

717
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,920
还是三者皆有
Or all of the above.

718
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,630
他在那边会没命的
He's going to die in there.

719
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,550
也许更糟
Or worse.

720
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,750
多谢了  迈可
Thanks, Mac.

721
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,580
你帮了我大忙
You really saved my ass.

722
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,150
帮了大家的大忙
All of our asses, really.

723
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,570
我是看在你的面子上[双关:翘臀]才帮忙的
Well, it was your ass that I did it for.

724
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,410
不想换个说法吗
You might want to rephrase that.

725
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,390
不了
Um... no.

726
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,950
这事别告诉埃文
Don't tell Evan about this.

727
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:52,630
为什么
Why?

728
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,340
我要先弄清楚一些事
I need to get some answers first.

729
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,440
少不了要你帮忙
With your help.

730
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,150
好吧  就按我们说好的
Okay, a deal's a deal.

731
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,290
不过我要说
But I will say that it's...

732
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,680
这里少了你感觉怪怪的
it's not the same here without you.

733
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,700
而且
And...

734
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,840
老天  没想到我要说这种话
Oh, my god, I can't believe I'm saying this.

735
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,360
我想你
I miss you.

736
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,890
那就帮个忙  常来看看我
Then do me a favor and visit me from time to time.

737
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,590
"我"在冷冻室里肯定很孤单
I must get lonely down there in the freezer.

738
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,780
想着你会常去看看  我就放心了
I'd like to think you were checking up on me.

739
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,280
就这么定了
Deal.

740
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,350
托比  这是什么玩意
Toby, what the hell's this?

741
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,920
这是...
Oh, it's, uh...

742
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,190
只是...
It's just that...

743
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,100
不要紧
Never mind.

744
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,480
网上的消息你封锁了吗
You get the internet shut down?

745
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,960
其实我想到了更好的办法
Actually, I did better than that.

746
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,020
让人为之一笑的是
...and on the lighter side,

747
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,910
一场精心策划的恐龙骗局今天风靡网络
an elaborate dinosaur hoax swept the internet today

748
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:55,810
当前播放: 骇人真恐龙实为恶作剧

749
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,920
此事始于本地滑板公园的一个恶作剧
following a prank at a local skate park.

750
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,780
在那儿  恐龙在那儿
There it is! There's the dinosaur!

751
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,860
请谨记  如果有人给了你一段
So remember, if somebody shows you footage

752
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,760
"骇人真恐龙"的视频
of a freaking real dinosaur,

753
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,780
要三思而后信
think twice before you believe it.

754
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,310
交给你了  山姆
Over to you, Sam.

755
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,000
干得好
Nice.

756
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,770
是啊  我觉得这不会是最后一次
Yeah, well, I figured it's not the last time

757
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:07,370
有人抓拍到恐龙  对吧
someone's gonna get a video of a dinosaur, right?

758
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,150
所以不如就让人们认为那全都是恶作剧
So might as well make them all seem fake.

759
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,550
你叫了迈可来帮忙
You called Mac in.

760
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,590
算是吧
Um... Sort of.

761
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,890
不过你说得对
But, uh, you were right.

762
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,600
他还需要点时间
He's gonna need some time.

763
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,480
干得好
Good work.

764
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,400
再给我放一遍那个报道
Hey, show me that thing one more time.

765
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,600
好
Yes.

766
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,530
巨大的角  而且
...massive horns, and...

767
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,700
在那儿  恐龙在那
There it is! There's the dinosaur!

768
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,810
有我的电话吗
Any calls?

769
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,350
只有霍尔上校打来
Just Colonel Hall.

770
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,460
他想知道最新进展
He'd like an update.

771
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,840
真不错
Oh, terrific.

772
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,290
你有烦心事
Something's bugging you.

773
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,030
我会变成那样吗
Is that where I'm headed?

774
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,150
我会是下一个
Am I the next crazy eyes

775
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,620
住在庄园里的科学怪人吗
living alone in a mansion somewhere?

776
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,840
你是因为迈可才走上这条路的吗
You going down this road because of Mac?

777
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,180
你知道他会回来的  对吗
You know he'll be back, right?

778
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,880
其实我是在想磁力计
I was thinking about this, actually.

779
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,390
我在这项技术上倾注了三年心血
Three years I've been working on this tech,

780
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,150
以为它能解决一切问题
thinking it would solve everything.

781
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,720
弥补一切遗憾
Make up for everything.

782
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,370
修正一切错误
Fix everything.

783
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,510
但如果它办不到呢
But what if it doesn't, hmm?

784
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,400
我第一次见到你时
The first time I saw you,

785
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,990
你手里就拿着个磁力计
you had one of those things in your hands.

786
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,340
你目不转睛地看着它
You couldn't keep your eyes off it.

787
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,820
我以为你是在用九十年代的大哥大呢
I thought you'd kept your phone from the 90's or something.

788
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,480
是啊  我总是给人留下良好的第一印象
Yeah, well, I always make a good first impression.

789
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,160
但这东西
But that thing,

790
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,940
今天送了我一份大礼
it gave me a gift today.

791
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,910
我一直...
I've, uh...

792
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,280
我一直在为这份工作纠结
I've been really struggling with this work,

793
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:19,230
因为这和猛兽控制队不一样
because it isn't like predator control.

794
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,990
猛兽控制队对付的大都是无害的动物
This isn't mostly harmless animals

795
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,720
偶尔才有杀人的猛兽
with the occasional killer.

796
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,520
这些生物却大都杀人不眨眼
These creatures are almost all killers.

797
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,970
今天我们终于遇到一只无害的恐龙
But today we finally had one that wasn't.

798
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,400
我们要做的就是把它送回家
And all we had to do was show it the way home,

799
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,340
而我们做到了
and we did that.

800
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,210
我们做到了
We did it.

801
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,160
你对这些生物有着
You have a feel for these things

802
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,860
我所没有的感情
that I don't have.

803
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,830
我甚至不确定我是否曾经有过
I'm not sure if I'll ever have it.

804
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,400
以前在家我常常得在周围绕上铁丝网
I used to coil razor wire back home.

805
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,830
因为经常有狼从森林里跑出来
We had wolves that would come down out of the forest

806
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,010
捕食我们养的羊
and try to eat our sheep.

807
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,860
爸爸说我们得挡住它们
My dad said we had to keep them out,

808
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,170
但是每过一个月左右
but every month or so,

809
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,210
我走到铁丝网外总能看到
I would come out, and I would f-find...

810
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,920
那些狼会被铁丝网缠住
They would get tangled in the wire sometimes.

811
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,560
为了求生它们会把爪子咬断
They'd chew their own paws off.

812
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,920
从那时起我就明白了
That's really when I got it, you know?

813
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,570
那不是它们的错  对吗
It isn't their fault, right?

814
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,290
那只是它们的本能
They're just being who they are.

815
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:32,980
问题在我们身上
We're the problem.

816
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,330
是人类想主宰一切
We're the ones who want everything to be human.

817
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,540
我们已经给整个世界围上了层层铁网
Now we've covered the whole damn world in razor wire.

818
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,700
而那些...
So where are...

819
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,740
那些动物要在何处安家呢
Where are the animals supposed to go?

820
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,270
但是今天
But today,

821
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,580
你想出了一个良策帮助它们
you came up with a better way to help them.

822
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,820
就是把它们送回那个没有人类的时代
To get them back to a time with no humans in it.

823
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,350
霍华德弄的那个零件
Hey, that thing that Howard made,

824
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,600
你还能弄出来吗
you can make that again?

825
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,990
那就去做吧
Then do it.

826
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,090
这项技术不只是为了帮助你
The tech isn't just to help you.

827
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,120
是为了帮助它们
It's to help them.

828
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,890
我们能做的也只有这些了  对吗
It's the least we can do, right?

829
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:35,410
形势所迫目标任务没有完成  长官
The mission objective was compromised by circumstances, sir.

830
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,230
但好的一面是
But on the positive side,

831
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,280
标本回到了它的自然栖息地
the specimen was returned to its natural habitat.

832
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,650
还有个有意思的新情况
And there was an interesting, um, development.

833
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,900
我会在报告中写明
I'll have that in my report.

834
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,830
是的  长官  不言而喻
Uh, yes, sir, that goes without saying.

835
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,620
我们目标一致
We are on the same team.

836
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,130
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.
