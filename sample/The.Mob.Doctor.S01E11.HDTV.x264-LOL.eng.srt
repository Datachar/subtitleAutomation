Amiodarone, 150.

All right,
screw the repair.

355
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:48,896
He's moving his legs in response
to stimuli but not his arms.

356
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:52,400
That's new. He came in
moving extremities times four.

357
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:54,619
So, he's showing progressive
paralysis following head trauma.

358
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:57,788
What's the
differential diagnosis?

359
00:16:57,823 --> 00:17:00,708
Spinal C.T. was negative.
Maybe... Central Cord Syndrome?

360
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:02,627
Sciwora? Need an MRI.

361
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:04,462
Eh, he's not
stable enough.

What do we know
about the mechanism of injury?

363
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,717
Chest and extremity abrasions.
Wrist fracture.

364
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,535
All right,
which suggests face-plant.

365
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:14,221
Could there have been extreme
cervical flection or extension?

She was there.
She saw him go down.

Grace discharged her, but
she called 911 from the lobby.

Uh...
I'm allergic to morphine.

386
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:19,987
There's this, um...
This other drug.

387
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:23,791
I think it's "d"-something.
Dilaudid?

Yeah.
That's the one.

It's 10 times more powerful
than morphine.

Well, I got 10 times the pain.

How's Jack?

402
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:08,953
At the moment,
his blood pressure is unstable.

403
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:11,422
We're having some trouble
weaning him off the ventilator.

404
00:19:11,456 --> 00:19:14,792
So, there is a possibility
of some brain or spinal injury.

405
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:15,960
Oh, no.

406
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:17,461
Oh, my God.
I thought the C.T. was normal.

407
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:20,264
Not all neurological injuries
show up on C.T.,

408
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:23,184
So we need to know
a little more about the crash.

409
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:25,352
You saw it happen, right?
No. I was there, but no.

I called the ambulance.

have surveillance cameras?

No names poped up.

to a bomb that was used

is it The Royal Diner?

Yeah,
that's what he said.

425
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:07,928
Why?
It was an insurance scam.

426
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:10,598
The owner wanted to make the
bombing look racially motivated,

427
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:13,400
Took the insurance payout,
and split town.

And how do you know so much
about this, my friend?

He just lets go
of the handlebars.

452

He might have lost consciousness
before the crash.

We've been going about this
the wrong way.

caused the trauma,</i>

diagnosis for A.L.O.C.

Besides head trauma?

458
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,173
What about, like, a weird toxin
exposure or brain infection?

459
00:21:38,224 --> 00:21:40,892
Has he been camping
or on any foreign trips?

on the trauma, we didn't ask.

pissed him off.

Tommy went after him with a blow
torch, burned him to the bone.

Could Jack have
caught something on the plane?

Maybe. We're doing
a full infectious workup.

He's gonna be okay.
Right?

Just tell us the truth,
son.

find out the cause, then...

It's okay. It's okay.

You got so much
to be thankful for.

869
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:28,732
Well, here's to
what you got on your mind.

871
00:42:31,018 --> 00:42:32,135
Sorry.

872
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:33,486
Not now, Gio.

873
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:36,406
Somebody's here to see you,
boss -- tells me it's urgent.

874
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,825
All right.
Let him in.

875
00:42:41,412 --> 00:42:45,198
He's clean.

876
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:47,650
I need to talk to you --
in private.

877
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:50,653
Who the hell
is this guy?

878
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:52,555
I've never
seen you before.

879
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,491
It's been a long time.

880
00:42:55,509 --> 00:43:00,496
Let me
tell you something, kid.

881
00:43:00,514 --> 00:43:02,382
I never forget a face.

882
00:43:02,433 --> 00:43:04,834
Then look closer.

883
00:43:06,804 --> 00:43:08,888
It's me, dad.
