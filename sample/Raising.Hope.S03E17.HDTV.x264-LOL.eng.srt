1
00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:03,300
(fly buzzing)

2
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:13,811
Come on, buddy.

3
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:15,779
It doesn't have to end badly.

4
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:18,015
Just trying to get you out safe.

5
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:20,684
(buzzing)

6
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,019
Ah...

7
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:26,023
Are you still trying
to catch that fly?

8
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:27,558
Just kill it.

9
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,560
Flies carry deadly diseases.

10
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,228
Why do you think there's
a "no-fly zone"

11
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:32,229
over the White House?

12
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:33,264
I can't kill it.

13
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:34,865
It's the one thing I've got.

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,400
Nobody else in high school

15
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:37,902
lived up to their potential.

16
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:39,637
Kevin Kinlan, voted
"Most likely to succeed"?

17
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:41,472
In prison for embezzlement.

18
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:43,107
John Zachary, voted
"Most athletic"?

19
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:44,675
Now he weighs 400 pounds.

20
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:46,877
He hasn't seen his feet or
his penis since the '90s.

21
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:49,647
I was the guy voted
"Least likely to hurt a fly."

22
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:51,415
I'm not going to blow it

23
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,218
and wind up like
the rest of those losers.

24
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:57,454
Oh, and those awards
mean <i>so</i> much.

25
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:59,757
I was voted "Most sarcastic."

26
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,625
Those geniuses
really nailed that one.

27
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:04,328
I got him!

28
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:06,163
Virginia, I got him!
(fly buzzing)

29
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:08,299
Go home.

30
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,267
Hug your wife
and kiss your maggots.

31
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,802
Today you live!

32
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:15,272
No!

33
00:01:15,307 --> 00:01:16,740
Wow.

34
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:19,877
That is gonna be a
slow, slow death.

44

And where did you
get that golf club?

45
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:49,073
- We don't even golf!
- I got it

46
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:50,874
- in case you ever Tiger Woods'd me.
- No,

47
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,009
I was sleepwalking, all right?

48
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:53,410
I used to sleepwalk as a kid

49
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:55,145
when-when I slept
in strange places,

50
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,448
and now it's-it's
happening again.

51
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,792
(engine running)

52
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:23,307
Oh, Jimmy, that's terrible.

53
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,009
We got to figure out
how to fix this.

54
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:26,510
What did your parents do?

55
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:27,645
Well, they got me a dog collar

56
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,413
and they put all my information
on the tag.

57
00:02:29,447 --> 00:02:31,582
Of course they did. The store
must have been out of leeches.

58
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:33,684
No, no, we got all our leeches
from a guy my dad knows,

59
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:35,486
and I'm pretty sure
they only work on chicken pox.

60
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:43,961
(microwave running)

61
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:46,530
Oh.

62
00:02:46,564 --> 00:02:48,065
The door to the microwave broke.

63
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,433
BURT:
Here.

64
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:52,169
Oh. I think we need to
buy a new microwave.

65
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:53,604
No, no. It's okay.
I think I have

66
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:54,972
a microwave in all my stuff.

67
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:56,206
It doesn't work,
but the door's still on.

68
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,441
We can just swap it out.

69
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:59,343
All your stuff?
You got rid of all your stuff

70
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:01,245
when you stopped hoarding.

71
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,513
You told me
you stopped hoarding.

72
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,716
I did.

73
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,618
Tell you that.

74
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:10,788
I can't believe you lied and
told me you stopped hoarding.

75
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:12,790
I haven't gambled once
since I quit.

76
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:15,125
I bet you $1,000
there's a bunch of other stuff

77
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,061
- you're not telling me.
- Why is this open?

78
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:18,729
Seriously. I bet you.
Right now.

79
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,731
Step away from the locker!

80
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:22,833
No, no, it's okay.
This is our stuff.

81
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,668
Not anymore.
You didn't pay your rent.

82
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:26,136
We're just airing out
the contents

83
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,805
before we put it up for auction.

84
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,839
Hold on there.

85
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:30,507
A working grandmother

86
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:32,276
goes without paying
for 24 months

87
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,278
and you just take
all her stuff?

88
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:35,346
Romney!

89
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,413
He lost, Burt.

90
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:37,915
- Obama!
- Look,

91
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:39,717
I don't know what to tell you.
If you want your stuff back,

92
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:43,187
you owe $700. Other than that,
it goes to the highest bidder.

93
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:44,388
VIRGINIA:
Hey! Hey!

94
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:46,457
Just because you have
every right to take our stuff

95
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:48,092
and I don't have
any argument against it

96
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:51,261
doesn't mean I'm done
talking to you, buddy!

97
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:54,865
Excuse me. If we could
just talk about this...

98
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:56,667
(whispers):
Oh, my God, look.

99
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:57,768
It's Creepy the Clown.

100
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:02,506
VIRGINIA: <i>Years ago, we
had a creepy clown doll</i>

101
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,241
<i>that used to freak Jimmy out.</i>

102
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:05,909
BURT (gruffly):
Jimmy.

103
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:07,511
(cackles)

104
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,546
(screams)

105
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:12,416
(laughing) It was hilarious.

106
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,451
(thunder rumbling)

107
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:28,599
(screaming)

108
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:31,969
<i>We didn't just torture Jimmy</i>
<i>with it.</i>

109
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:34,171
<i>We also used it</i>
<i>to keep him out of danger.</i>

110
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,643
(screams)

111
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:42,446
<i>And while some things</i>
<i>could shock him for a second,</i>

112
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,482
<i>other things could</i>
<i>scar him for life.</i>

113
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:49,853
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

114
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:52,890
We don't have the money
for that much therapy.

115
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:56,827
<i>So we needed to hide</i>
<i>the tape in a place</i>

116
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,863
<i>we knew Jimmy would never look.</i>

117
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:05,202
(whistles)

118
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:07,204
<i>It was a perfect hiding place</i>

119
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:09,206
<i>until Maw Maw decided</i>
<i>to donate stuff</i>

120
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,208
<i>to the church rummage sale.</i>

121
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:12,910
<i>And that was the last time</i>

122
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:15,946
<i>we ever saw</i>
<i>that creepy-looking clown.</i>

123
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:21,285
(zapping)
Ouch! Ouch!

124
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,454
Is this unit up for auction?

125
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:25,389
They're all up
for bid Saturday morning.

126
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:29,393
(quietly): We've got to get our
sex tape out of that clown's ass.

127
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:32,429
I bet nobody's ever said
that before.

128
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,592
JIMMY: - You ready?
- Yeah.

129
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:39,761
(voices speaking indistinctly
on television)

130
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:41,763
- What do you think?
- I think

131
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:43,765
America's about to elect
a terrorist as a vice president

132
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:46,301
if somebody doesn't start
listening to Claire Danes.

133
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:47,302
Oh,

134
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:49,404
you mean your sleep apnea mask.

135
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:50,972
If it prevents you
from sleepwalking,

136
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:52,073
I think it's great.

137
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:53,942
I think I look
like a fighter pilot.

138
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:55,410
You get to pretend
you're sleeping

139
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:56,711
with Tom Cruise tonight.

140
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:58,780
- Ooh. Okay.
- Maybe get

141
00:05:58,814 --> 00:06:00,048
into a little "risky business."

142
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:01,149
Is there any way
I can prevent you

143
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:02,350
from ruining
my <i>Homeland</i> marathon

144
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:04,152
by making bad Tom Cruise
references all night?

145
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:05,620
That's a "mission impossible."

146
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:09,624
Get ready for "the firm."

147
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:10,992
'Cause I'm about
to make it "rain...

148
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:13,161
...man."

149
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:14,362
(groans)

150
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:16,397
(birds chirping)

151
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,838
Aw, not again!

152
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:27,008
(sighs)

153
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:29,010
Yo!

154
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,884
What are you doing?

155
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:37,285
The guy at the storage space

156
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,721
said those auctions go up
to 500 bucks.

157
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:40,989
So if we want to get

158
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:41,990
our sex tape back,

159
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:43,291
we need to make some quick cash,

160
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:44,993
and I'm willing to try anything.

161
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:47,996
Which is something whoever gets
that tape is gonna find out.

162
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,564
But you can't sell the van.

163
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,000
Why not? Jimmy and Sabrina
have a new car.

164
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:54,369
I have a car,
you have your work truck.

165
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:57,572
Maw Maw won this scooter in
a poker game with Mrs. Peables.

166
00:06:57,606 --> 00:06:59,741
Even after the stroke,
she still doesn't have

167
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:01,376
much of a poker face.

168
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:04,879
I know we don't <i>need</i>
the van, but...

169
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:06,814
it's like a part of the family.

170
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,050
It has so many special memories.

171
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:11,586
♪
♪ (creaking)

172
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:20,562
(chuckles)

173
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:23,331
If there was a Tongue Hall of
Fame, Burt, you'd be in it.

174
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:25,500
And-and if there was
a Tongue Nobel Prize,

175
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:27,101
you'd have a whole shelf full.

176
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:28,770
(chuckling)

177
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:30,705
Ah, that's it!

178
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:33,074
I can't listen
to this tape anymore.

179
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:34,042
It's been stuck

180
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:36,244
in there since I bought the van.

181
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:37,679
Ah.

182
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:39,247
(grunts)

183
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:48,723
Not again.

184
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:56,231
I can't do it.

185
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:57,799
We're not selling the van.

186
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,434
You're gonna have to find
something else to sell.

187
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:03,071
BARNEY:
Hmm, clarity in the hooves.

188
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:05,807
Perfectly symmetrical
snout holes.

189
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:09,677
Only the tiny hands
of a scared Chinese child

190
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:12,080
can achieve that craftsmanship.

191
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:14,282
But I don't see the one
you know I want.

192
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:15,717
I brought you everything I have.

193
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:17,385
This is all I've got.

194
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:18,953
I've been to your house,
Virginia.

195
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:22,090
I want your Swiney Todd, the
Demon Butcher of Meat Street,

196
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,925
wanted for multiple ham-icides.

197
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,428
The worst-selling character
in Pigurine history, and thus...

198
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:28,830
the rarest.

199
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:31,866
(groans) Fine.

200
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:35,803
I'll sell it to you.

201
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:37,171
But just so you know,

202
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:39,741
I consider this
highway hoggery.

203
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:46,214
H-Hoggery. (laughs)
I got it. I got it.

204
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:48,216
(laughs)

205
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,151
I just came up with that.

206
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:54,322
Where you been?

207
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:57,158
(quietly): Operation Steal Our
Microwave Door successful.

208
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:58,226
MAN: All right, we're gonna start
the bidding at five dollars.

209
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,427
Somebody give me five,
somebody give me five.

210
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,262
I got five right there.
Anybody with six?

211
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:03,164
- Six!
- Six dollars. Can I get seven?

212
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:04,532
- Seven!
- Seven, I got seven. I got seven.

213
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:06,768
- $20!
- $20! Right over there, $20...

214
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:08,594
Frank, what the hell?

215
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:10,038
Look, I don't know
why you want this locker,

216
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:11,698
but I'll make you a deal. 21!

217
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,241
You let us win this locker,

218
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:15,501
we'll give you everything inside
except for that

219
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:17,337
cute little clown doll for Hope.

220
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:18,972
You can keep the doll,

221
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:21,983
but I get to keep
the sex tape inside.

222
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,044
Oh, I know.

223
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,045
_

224
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:30,083
What's going on there?

225
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:31,651
Yeah, my mom's selling
some of her Pigurines

226
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:34,253
to bid on a storage unit
that has her sex tape in it.

227
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:38,725
- $100!
- I got $100 right there!

228
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,360
$125!
(man shouts)

229
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:41,995
- $200!
- $300!

230
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,663
- $400!
- $400 right there!

231
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:46,032
- What? - I know how much Jimmy
makes at the grocery store.

232
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:48,001
- Where'd you get that kind of money?
- I won 800 bucks

233
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:50,370
coming in second place
at a demolition derby.

234
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:51,904
My Pacer is totaled.

235
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:55,641
Look. If you care about me
as a friend at all...

236
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:57,577
$450! You won't do this.

237
00:09:57,611 --> 00:09:59,479
Okay, fine.
I'll make you a deal.

238
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:01,547
$475! You can keep the tape,

239
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:03,049
but I would like to rent it
on occasion.

240
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,817
$480! Okay, but just once.

241
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:07,086
$485! Go on.

242
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:08,388
You have to watch it
at our house,

243
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:10,690
and you have to keep
your pants on. $490!

244
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:13,559
No rewinds, no copies,
no pauses.

245
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:16,562
$495! One pause,
eight seconds long.

246
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:18,197
- Fine!
- Deal!

247
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:21,701
- $500!
- $500! $500 going once...

248
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:23,503
$500 going twice...

249
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:26,372
- sold, $500! Come on in.
- Yes!

250
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,408
(chuckles)

251
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:32,211
What? There's no hole!

252
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:33,880
Oh, my God!

253
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:37,050
I just sold my Pigurines
and blew $500

254
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:40,353
on the wrong stuffed clown that
doesn't have our sex tape in it.

255
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:42,055
Don't beat yourself up
about it.

256
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,724
I'm sure this happens to
people all the time. (groans)

257
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:46,392
(whimpers)

258
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:54,859
I don't know if exercising
is gonna be the answer

259
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:58,696
to my sleepwalking, and plus,
I kind of feel ridiculous.

260
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:01,199
SABRINA: Yeah, well, last
night you walked through town

261
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:03,635
in your boxer shorts
and my fuzzy slippers, so...

262
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,503
I think this is worth a shot.

263
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:07,639
Hey.

264
00:11:07,673 --> 00:11:09,374
Either your parents
are having a yard sale

265
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:11,175
or your house finally threw up.

266
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,510
Yeah, talk about a lot
of stuff I don't need.

267
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:13,645
I already got

268
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,313
the wolf blanket, I got that
same bikini poster girl...

269
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:16,381
Wait a second.

270
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:17,415
What are you guys doing?

271
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:18,683
Oh, your mother's
having a yard sale

272
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:20,084
so she can buy back
her Pigurines.

273
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:21,519
I'm selling all
the stuff we got

274
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:22,687
from that storage unit we won

275
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:23,821
along with some of your crap.

276
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:26,658
You just can't sell my stuff!

277
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:30,194
This is 100% authentic
bathtub gin

278
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:33,498
passed down to me by
my great aunt, Blind Lizzy,

279
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:36,267
to her daughter, Blind Betty,
and then finally her sons,

280
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:40,438
Blind Barry and Sightless Sam,
who spoke the recipe to me.

281
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:41,873
Ten bucks a jar,

282
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:44,075
'cause this is probably
the last batch I can make

283
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:46,611
'cause my eyes aren't
what they used to be.

284
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:47,946
Thank you.

285
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,514
How much for this photo album?

286
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:50,448
Two dollars.

287
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:51,649
I don't want the pictures.

288
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:53,885
Looking at other people's
memories makes me sad.

289
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,055
Sorry, we got this stuff from
somebody else's storage space.

290
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:59,791
Huh. That's actually a
pretty cute baby right there.

291
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:01,259
Wow, what a happy family.

292
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:04,095
He looks so peaceful
sleeping in his bassinet.

293
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:06,164
Hey... it's that one
right there.

294
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,469
And there he is learning
to ride that bike!

295
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:15,473
Are you gonna sell me the book
or narrate every photo?

296
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:17,976
This album's not for sale.

297
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,344
There's a family out there

298
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:21,279
who would love to have
these wonderful memories.

299
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:23,548
You can go buy some of my
son's crap over there.

300
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:25,116
What are you doing?

301
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,584
Virginia, we can't
sell this stuff,

302
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:27,885
It's not ours.

303
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,921
The people in these pictures
are gonna want it back.

304
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:33,024
This is the history of their
courtship and their marriage...

305
00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:35,259
and their underwater birth.

306
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:36,794
Oh, scratch that.

307
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:38,429
They're just went snorkeling
with a baby sea otter.

308
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:40,431
Well, I need money
to get my Pigurines back.

309
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:42,800
Fine. I'll sell the van.

310
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,609
Well, the shocks still work.

311
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:53,411
(sighing)

312
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:56,114
Now all I need is some good-looking
friends and a talking dog

313
00:12:56,148 --> 00:12:59,250
and my mystery-solving
business is up and running.

314
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,222
(choking):
I'm gonna miss her.

315
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:05,757
If you want, I can pick you up

316
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,458
every now and then
and take you for a ride.

317
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:10,728
No. I think that'll just
confuse the van.

318
00:13:57,943 --> 00:13:59,577
(quietly):
Jimmy?

319
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:04,582
(sighing)

320
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:06,784
I can't believe you sold
the van for strangers,

321
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:09,554
but when I wanted to get the
tape back to keep my dignity,

322
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:10,721
you wouldn't even listen.

323
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:12,323
I only sold it to
help you buy back

324
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:13,825
your precious Pigurines.

325
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,827
I told you that, but you
don't listen to me.

326
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:17,028
I don't listen to you?

327
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:18,162
You don't listen to me.

328
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:19,764
I'm not listening to this.

329
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:24,502
- Hey.
- Hi.

330
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,704
We found a bunch of mail
with this address on it

331
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:28,506
in an old storage unit and
we're trying to find out

332
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,174
who it belongs to so we can
return all their stuff.

333
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,577
Burt! Virginia!
I know who you are.

334
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:34,378
Christine, get over here!

335
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:36,914
Hi.

336
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:38,015
Oh.

337
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,184
It's Burt and Virginia.

338
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:42,019
How do you know us?

339
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:44,188
From your sex tape.

340
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,224
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

341
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,692
Oh, my God!

342
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:50,194
- That's exactly how she
says it on the tape! - I know!

343
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,158
(slight snicker)

344
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:02,626
(whispering):
I know.

345
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:05,930
Burt, I almost didn't
recognize you

346
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:08,666
with your contemporary
hairstyle.

347
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,333
Virginia, have you kept up with
contemporary grooming trends?

348
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,337
I'm a little uncomfortable

349
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,973
with how comfortable
you two are with us.

350
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:18,008
Oh, no, it's just that
we've seen your tape

351
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,477
like, a thousand times.

352
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:22,947
Yeah, you said that...
like, 2,000 times.

353
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:24,982
I remember the day we got it.

354
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:27,051
<i>We were getting ready to move</i>

355
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:28,652
<i>into my brother-in-law's</i>
<i>guest house</i>

356
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:30,855
<i>and we bought a bunch of things</i>
<i>at the church rummage sale,</i>

357
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,191
<i>but we got more</i>
<i>than we paid for.</i>

358
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:38,629
<i>I wasn't really</i>
<i>a sex tape kind of guy,</i>

359
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,398
<i>but we'd been fighting</i>
<i>and I thought,</i>

360
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:42,933
<i>hey, this might</i>
<i>shake us out of our rut.</i>

361
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,274
I've never seen
anything like this.

362
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:52,610
Why don't we ever role play
as a maid and a yard guy

363
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:54,879
doing it in an old
haunted house?

364
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:59,116
Your tape was heaven-sent.

365
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,885
We watched it almost
every night.

366
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,853
Yeah, we even started showing it
to our sons, Dominic and Logan.

367
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:04,121
What?!

368
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:06,357
I hope, for your kids' sake,
they're blind and deaf.

369
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:07,591
Oh, no, no, no. It's not,
it's not like that.

370
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:10,361
No, Jimmy, um, edited out
all the sex parts.

371
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:12,029
You guys had such
an amazing relationship

372
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:13,864
that we took a triple-X
and made it into a "G"

373
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:16,467
so we could use it as a
teaching tool for relationships.

374
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:17,501
Check it out.

375
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,171
NARRATOR:
Compassion.

376
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:22,973
(fly buzzing) Oh, no, no, Burt.

377
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:25,276
It flew over back by the door.

378
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,311
Come here, buddy.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

379
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:28,679
It's all about
catch and release.

380
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:31,515
(grunting):
Come... aww...

381
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,651
(murmuring):
Come here.

382
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:36,654
I got him! I got him!

383
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:41,559
I love how nice you are

384
00:16:41,593 --> 00:16:43,160
to all of God's creatures.

385
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:44,995
I could never hurt a fly.

386
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,731
NARRATOR:
Understanding.

387
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:51,469
(panting, sighing)

388
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:53,938
You got, like, 12 alarm
clocks under the bed.

389
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,906
I don't know.

390
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:59,577
I just keep buying them
just in case.

391
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:00,711
You don't think I'm, like,

392
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:03,914
one of those crazy
hoarders, do you?

393
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:05,149
No.

394
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:07,651
No, you're just being prepared.

395
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:10,020
I imagine one day, of us
is going to have a job

396
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:13,123
that'll require us
to be somewhere on time.

397
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,892
NARRATOR:
Listening.

398
00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:16,727
I think it's your turn to start

399
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:18,395
'cause I ripped off your
clothes last time.

400
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,797
Oh, speaking of rip-offs,

401
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,166
the Johnsons told me they want
to change landscapers today

402
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,702
after I trimmed
all their trees.

403
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:27,071
I spent hours trying
to nail the branches back on,

404
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:29,106
then I just gave up
and I peed in the pool.

405
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,176
Oh, it's for the best.

406
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,545
Those people
treated you like crap,

407
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:36,447
they never paid you on time,

408
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,249
and I could always
hear the stress in your voice

409
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:40,384
every time you went over there.

410
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:42,620
This landscaping thing
is only temporary.

411
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:44,889
Your rock band is
about to take off.

412
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,628
Oh, my God.

413
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:51,929
Burt, do you believe that?

414
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:53,264
I know.

415
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:55,165
I thought we were the only
ones who still had a VCR.

416
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
Me, too!

417
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:59,436
God, I'm so glad to hear
that's what you were thinking.

418
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:00,604
I feel like we've been
so out of sync

419
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:01,939
the last couple of weeks.

420
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:04,675
It's like we lost something,
but I'm not sure what.

421
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,911
Well, if I had to pick
three things out of thin air,

422
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:08,913
I'd say compassion,

423
00:18:08,947 --> 00:18:11,482
understanding and
maybe listening.

424
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:13,951
No, Burt, you know what it is?

425
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:15,319
It's listening,

426
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:18,489
and I'm sorry
if I haven't been.

427
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:19,957
Me, too.

428
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:25,796
No, no, no.

429
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,699
We are not filming
a sequel here, weirdoes.

430
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,833
And we want our sex tape back.

431
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,869
No. You can't.
We need it.

432
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:32,970
I thought we were friends.

433
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:34,939
We barely know you.

434
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:36,707
How 'bout we buy it from you?

435
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:37,875
- No way.
- Eight hundred.

436
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,710
Deal. I'll get
my checkbook.

437
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,145
Virginia, what are you doing?

438
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:42,780
I want to get your van back

439
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:44,982
and sacrifice for you
the way you sacrificed for me

440
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:46,817
to get my Pigurines back.

441
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:54,558
Could you stop staring at me?

442
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:57,561
I know your mind's blown meeting
"Virginia from the sex tape,"

443
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,164
but you're making me
feel self-conscious.

444
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:01,732
Actually, um, I was just,

445
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,701
I was wondering about
that-that mole that you have

446
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:05,202
on your left butt cheek.

447
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:06,804
Did you ever get that
checked out?

448
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,573
We have to go.

449
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:10,708
Okay.

450
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:14,478
SABRINA:
That's it! That's it!

451
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:15,646
I got it!

452
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:19,483
Whoa. Hey, what's
going on?

453
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:20,718
Mmm,

454
00:19:20,752 --> 00:19:22,052
I had to figure this out.

455
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:23,454
I just couldn't
take it anymore.

456
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:26,090
I knew there had to be
an answer to this mystery

457
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:26,991
and I just wasn't
going to sleep

458
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,058
until I figured it out.

459
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:30,928
Jimmy, you have been
sleepwalking your whole life.

460
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,931
I'm not gonna let that
happen again.

461
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:34,932
So I asked myself,

462
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,867
what do all your
sleepwalks have in common?

463
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:38,902
The red pins are where
you've been falling asleep,

464
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:41,872
and the blue pins are
where you've been waking up.

465
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:42,940
So if you extend this line,

466
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,842
you'll see that
you've been walking

467
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:48,212
towards the same place, okay?

468
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:50,047
This is your Mecca.

469
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:51,649
This is your homeland,

470
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:52,916
the Chance residence.

471
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:54,885
Yeah, but just now, I woke up

472
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:56,053
in the dining room.

473
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:57,755
That's where your stuff is.

474
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,391
Oh, yeah!

475
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:01,558
That's right!

476
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:05,329
Why doesn't anybody
ever believe me?!

477
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:08,065
