<font color="#ec14bd">士兵最强大的武器就是勇气</font>

3
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:17,036
困境！
Stranded!

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,037
在共和国的一个秘密任务中
On a secret mission for the Republic,

5
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:21,907
Gascon上校带领他的铁皮人队伍
and his intrepid droid squad

6
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:24,043
成功从分离势力的船上偷到一个加密模块
successfully steal an encryption module

7
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:25,811


8
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:28,180
在逃跑的时候，我们英雄的飞船坠毁
During their escape, our heroes crash

9
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:30,249
在ABAFAR星系的外环附近
on the Outer Rim planet of Abafar

10
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:32,886
他们发现自己被困在一个奇怪的荒地中
and find themselves stranded
in the strange wasteland

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,921
维德在召唤
called The Void.

12
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:37,291
尽管困难重重，
Now, after surviving against all odds,

13
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:39,593
我们的英雄必须找到一条回家的路
our heroes must find a way home

14
00:00:39,627 --> 00:00:41,328
把加密模块带回家
and deliver the encryption module

15
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:45,132
破解分离势力的密码，阻挡敌人的进攻
to crack the Separatist code
and stop an enemy attack.

16
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:47,201


17
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:49,470
我从没到过塔图恩星球（天行者的故乡）
I have never been to Tatooine,

18
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:51,738
R2,但如果这个地方让你想起那儿
but if this place
reminds you of it, Artoo,

19
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:53,974
记得提醒我不要去那里
remind me never to go there.

20
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:57,143


21
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:59,079


22
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:00,947
有礼貌些，呆头
Don't be absurd, Qutee.

23
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:02,982
这些人是无害的
These people aren't dangerous.

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,122


25
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:13,192


26
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:15,761
大部分人可能都藏起来了
Most of these people are probably hiding

27
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:18,463
为了躲避某个东西
from someone or something.

28
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:21,532
在外环的角落里有一条路
That's the way it is
on these Outer Rim armpits.

29
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,267
没人经过这里
Nobody's here by choice,

30
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:25,135
我也是第一次走
which goes double for me.

31
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,536
我希望你有一个计划
I hope you have a plan

32
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:29,038
带领我们走出这个困境，上校
to get us off this armpit, Colonel.

33
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:31,474
我当然会的，下士
Of course I do, Corporal.

34
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,143
我们必须找到一个通讯设备
All we need is a communications uplink

35
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,144
和一些燃料
and some fuel.

36
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,679


37
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,947
感谢你的提醒，C4
Thank you for the reminder, Ceefor,

38
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:42,350
但我很清楚飞船在维德受到的损害
but I'm well aware our shuttle's
lost in The Void.

39
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:44,887
我说的是我所需的燃料
I'm talking about fuel for me.

40
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:47,956
你们铁皮人可以互相分享电池能源
You droids can putter along
on battery power

41
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,492
但我需要食物充饥
but I need food to survive.

42
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,295
我的能量也正在耗尽
My power cells are running low too,

43
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,598
如果有换机油服务也挺好
and an oil bath would be nice.

44
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:59,101
这里的尘埃让我的关节磨损严重
All this dust is wreaking havoc
on my joints.

45
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:00,102


46
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:01,470
别期望了，电子人
Forget it, Beezee.

47
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:03,439
我们来这不是度假
We're not on vacation here.

48
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:06,443
R2,加密模块安全吗？
Artoo, is the encryption module safe?

49
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:08,178


50
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:10,748
肢解或死亡都不会
Nothing short of death or dismemberment

51
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,950
阻止GASON上校
will stop Colonel Meebur Gascon

52
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:16,120
把加密模块送到Coruscant
from delivering
that module to Coruscant.

53
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,193
嗯，我想也是
Well, I'll be.

54
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:24,696
一次晚餐，一个吃东西的地方
A diner.
A place of eating.

55
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:26,798
我获救了
[chuckles] I'm saved.

56
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,568
R2,你和其他铁皮人去周围戒备
Artoo, you and the other 'mechs
scout the perimeter.

57
00:02:29,602 --> 00:02:32,604
看看附近是否有什么威胁
Find out if there
are any unfriendlies around.

58
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:37,943
下士，我和你都需要在这个地方补充燃料
Corporal, you and I will refuel
in this fine establishment.

59
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:46,418


60
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,059
真是好日子
Good day.

61
00:02:57,597 --> 00:03:02,268
我是大共和帝国军队的GASON上校
I am Colonel Gascon of
the Grand Army of the Republic.

62
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:05,238
我来这里执行一个非常重要的任务
And I am here
on very important business.

63
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:14,347
我时间很紧，你是否能提供一份快餐给我
I don't have much time,
so if you'll be so kind

64
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:18,452
再帮我的铁皮人充一下电？
as to fix me your daily special
and let my droid recharge.

65
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:22,055
铁皮人没办法
No droids.

66
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,491
好的
Fine.

67
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:26,894
在外面等我，下士
Wait for me outside, Corporal.

68
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:29,931
对你们这种类型，我们也不提供服务
We don't serve your type either.

69
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:33,001
你适用于哪种类型？
What type are you referring to?

70
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:35,971
管道蠕虫
Conduit worms.

71
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:42,645
你说什么？ 我是一个ZIKAN
I beg your pardon.
I am a Zilkan.

72
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:45,482
你正在争取自己的生存
You'll be begging for your life

73
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,283
如果你不打它
if you don't beat it.

74
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,753


75
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,789
揍它
Beat it.

76
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:52,789
Uh-oh.

77
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:53,824
Ah!

78
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,727
Oh, ah!

79
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:59,129
很黄很暴力
This is an outrage.

80
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:01,565
那个怪物会为今天而感到后悔的
That monstrosity will rue the day

81
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,567
他拒绝为我提供食物
he denied me a meal.

82
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:05,636
我不想给它压力，上校
I would not push it, Colonel.

83
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,572
那个怪物可能会为你准备食物的
That monstrosity
might make a meal out of you.

84
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:09,940
我不在乎
[sighs] I don't care.

85
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:11,542
我感到饥饿
I'm famished.

86
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:19,917
我想我能提供帮助
I think I can help.

87
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:24,121


88
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:35,133
你的快餐准备好了，先生
Your meal awaits you, sir.

89
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:38,070
你的短接板
You short-circuiting
hydrospanner,

90
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:39,404
那不是食物
that's no meal.

91
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:41,406
那是垃圾
That is garbage.

92
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:42,741
有什么不同吗？
What is the difference?

93
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:44,242
它可以吃，不是吗？
It is edible, is it not?

94
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:46,678


95
00:04:58,025 --> 00:04:59,392


96
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:08,869


97
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:12,373
Agh!

98
00:05:12,407 --> 00:05:13,741


99
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:15,777
哦，对不起
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

100
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:16,878
我没注意你在那里
I didn't see you there.

101
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:18,580
听着，我可以给你一些食物
Look, I could get you some food,

102
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:21,717
正常的人会从前门进来
but normally people
come in the front door.

103
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:24,854
但没问题
But there's no problem.

104
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:28,157
你知道你正在吃垃圾，对吧？
You do know that
you're eating garbage, right?

105
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,129
你是一个克隆人
You're a clone.

106
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:33,464
你说什么？
Excuse me?

107
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:35,500
嗯, 我--

108
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:36,534
我对此一无所知
I wouldn't know about that.

109
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,236
我的..我的名字是GREGOR
My--my name's Gregor.

110
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,772
嗯，等一下，克隆人是什么？
Uh, wait, what's a clone?

111
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:49,080
你就是一个克隆人
You are a clone.

112
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:51,748
你在进行间谍活动吗？
[laughs] Are you working undercover?

113
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:54,718
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

114
00:05:54,752 --> 00:05:57,253
听着，士兵，不管你的任务是什么
Listen to me, soldier,
whatever your assignment is,

115
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:59,288
也不可能比我的任务重要
it can't be more important than mine.

116
00:05:59,323 --> 00:06:01,057
这是他第一次真正的任务
It is his first real mission.

117
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:02,725
他只是一个读图员
He is just a map reader.

118
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,261
别听那个笨蛋的话
Don't listen to that ignoramus.

119
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:08,897
你是一个克隆人，也是一个共和国军队里面的士兵
You are a clone and a soldier
in the Republic Army,

120
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:11,533
我命令你带我上你的飞船
and I order you to take me to your ship.

121
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:14,236
我们需要尽快回到Coruscant
We need to get back to Coruscant
immediately.

122
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,206
嗯，朋友，我只是想提供帮助而已
Uh, look, friend,
I was just trying to help.

123
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,241
如果你不误人子弟就好了
I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way.

124
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:20,575
我想那个士兵
I do not think that soldier

125
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,179
不相信你也是一个克隆，嗯，上校
believes you are a colonel, uh, Colonel.

126
00:06:24,214 --> 00:06:25,514
Gregor!

127
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:27,783
干活去吧
Get back to work.

128
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:30,085
嗯，对不起，我必须走了
Uh, excuse me.
I got to go.

129
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:32,354
我不想失去我的工作
I don't want to lose my job.

130
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,626
但我还是很饿
But I'm still hungry.

131
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,164


132
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:45,467


133
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:52,641
嗯，有什么侦查报告吗？
Well, what's the scouting report?

134
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:56,344


135
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:57,846
分离势力的铁皮人？
Separatist droids?

136
00:06:57,913 --> 00:07:01,483
嗯，那会让事情复杂化
Hmm, well, that complicates matters.

137
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:07,655
这样，嗯，老板
So, uh, boss,

138
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,391
你知道，我有个疑问...
you know, I was just wondering...

139
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:12,493
不，你得不到升职,Gregor
No, you can't have a raise, Gregor.

140
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:13,628
哦，不 不 不 不 
Oh, no, no, no, no.

141
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:15,663
我不是想升职，先生
I don't want a raise, sir.

142
00:07:15,698 --> 00:07:19,534
我-我只是想，克隆人是什么？
I-I just wanted to know,
what's a clone?

143
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:22,304
有人告诉我，我是一个克隆人
Someone told me I was a clone today.

144
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:23,405
他们很确信这点
They insisted.

145
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,606
嗯，一个克隆人？
Heh.
A clone?

146
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,707


147
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:29,043
克隆人在星系间战斗
Clones fight battles across the galaxy.

148
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:31,213
他们是勇敢的战士
They are brave soldiers.

149
00:07:31,247 --> 00:07:34,582
你和他们有何相似之处？
Does that sound like you?

150
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:37,084
你是一个洗碗工，Gregor.
You're a dishwasher, Gregor.

151
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:40,788
忘了克隆人或相关事情
Forget about clones
or anything like that.

152
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:42,990
你在这有美好的生活
You have good life here,

153
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:44,892
一个简单的生活
a simple life.

154
00:07:44,926 --> 00:07:47,460
在伯克斯发现你的时候就开始了
More than you had when Borkus found you.

155
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,762
我知道，先生
I know, sir.

156
00:07:48,796 --> 00:07:50,163
我很欣赏你所做的每件事情
And I appreciate everything
that you've done.

157
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:51,163
相信我
Believe me.

158
00:07:51,198 --> 00:07:53,433
但我想，也许你--
But I thought
maybe you could--

159
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,835
能不能告诉我，我是怎么到这儿的？
could you tell me, how did I get here?

160
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:57,003
你在哪里找到我的？
Where did you find me?

161
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:58,404
问题够多了
Enough questions.

162
00:07:58,438 --> 00:07:59,672
回家去睡觉吧
Go home. Sleep.

163
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:03,042
明天再回来干活
Come back tomorrow.
Do your job.

164
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:06,345
而我不想再听到任何和“克隆人”有关的话语
And I don't ever want to hear
that word "clone" again,

165
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,780
明白了吗？
understand?

166
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:20,196
不得不说，我们经在
I cannot help noticing

167
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,014
执行我们的第三个计划了
that we are already on our third plan.

168
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:28,433
小型战斗需要灵活机动和及时应变的策略
Smart battle strategy requires
flexibility and improvisation,

169
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,501
这些都是铁皮人所缺乏的特质
something droids are not known for.

170
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:32,703


171
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:34,038
R2说的对
Artoo is right.

172
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:36,506
铁皮人缺少变通
Droids are not known for being flexible,

173
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,509
因为我们的程序早就已经固化了
because we are programmed
to be right the first time.

174
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:41,578
那么，下士，请回答这个问题
Well, answer me this, Corporal,

175
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:44,414
如果绝地委员会认为某个铁皮人
if the Jedi Council
thought one of you droids

176
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:46,816
更适合执行这次任务
were better prepared
to lead this mission,

177
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,519
那为什么他们又让我来指挥呢？
then why did they put me in charge?

178
00:08:49,553 --> 00:08:52,455
因为只有你才能钻进铁罐里面
'Cause you were the only one
who could fit inside Beezee.

179
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:58,162
不，是因为我拥有推理能力
No, it is because my power
of deduction told me

180
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:01,432
比如说，在ABAFAR星球看见铁皮人
that if there
are Separatist droids on Abafar,

181
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:04,169
我就可以推断出附近肯定有一个着陆点，
then there must be a landing zone nearby

182
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:08,006
而那里绝对有一艘可以带我们回家的飞船
where there will be no doubt
a shuttle to take us home.

183
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,377
那才是我作为指挥官的原因，下士
That, Corporal, is why I am in charge.

184
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:18,617
现在，我们偷偷下到那儿，别被发现哦
Now, we are going
to waltz down there, undetected,

185
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:20,619
就像上次我们在战舰中所做的一样
just like we did on the dreadnought,

186
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:24,022
然后占领那艘飞船，我不希望发生意外
and commandeer that shuttle
without incident.

187
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:26,391


188
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:27,859
铁皮人有个想法，上校
The 'mechs have a point, Colonel.

189
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:29,494
自从我们上次战舰行动以后
After what we did on the dreadnought,

190
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,630
那些战斗机器人可能已经暴露身份
those battle droids probably
have our identities scanned.

191
00:09:32,664 --> 00:09:35,466
这次我们不得不打开一条血路才能登舰了
We will have to fight our way
onto the shuttle this time.

192
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,135
嗯，你们铁皮人可能有自己的看法
Hmm, you droids may have a point.

193
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:39,870
但没有捷径可走
But there's no way in Malachor

194
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:42,739
我准备带领这支可怜的小分队
that I'm going to lead
this pitiful squad

195
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:45,341
对那个着陆点进行一次攻击
on an assault of that landing zone.

196
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,943
上校，你有什么计划？
What is the plan now, Colonel?

197
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:51,013
我要等到我们的克隆人下班
We're going to wait
until our clone gets off work,

198
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:55,051
才能取得他的帮助，不管他愿不愿意
then enlist his help,
whether he wants to or not.

199
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,617


200
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:49,271
REX上尉报到
Captain Rex reporting for duty.

201
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:50,705
啊！什么？
Agh! What?

202
00:10:56,979 --> 00:10:58,679
我...
I...

203
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:00,247
我不明白
I don't understand.

204
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:02,515
那是我自己？
That's me?

205
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,617
不，那是REX上尉
No, that's Captain Rex.

206
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:07,286
他是共和国军队的克隆人士兵
He's a clone in the Republic Army,

207
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:09,455
就像你一样，Gregor.
just like you, Gregor.

208
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:13,158
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

209
00:11:13,193 --> 00:11:14,793
OK, 别急，放松
Okay, slow down.
Slow down.

210
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:19,365
你是说还有更多这样的克隆人？
So you're telling me that there
are more of these clones?

211
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,301
数以百万。整个军队都是
Millions.
A whole army's worth.

212
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:24,036
Uh-huh.

213
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:27,373
他们看起来和我一模一样？
And they all look exactly like me?

214
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:30,876
不，那些克隆人都是战士，
No, those clones are warriors,

215
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,912
由共和国创造的职业军人，
professional soldiers
created by the Republic,

216
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:37,182
训练有素，勇敢无畏
trained to fight, and die if necessary,

217
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:39,618
在我们对抗分离势力的战争中建功立业
in our war against the Separatists.

218
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:40,986
他们不是在害虫出没的洞穴中
They're not dishwashers

219
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,389
生活的洗碗工。
living in
some vermin-infested hovel.

220
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:46,158


221
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:49,328
听着，能在这里生活，我觉得很幸运
Look, I'm lucky to live in this place.

222
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:52,364
博克斯先生说我的薪水不包括房租
Mr. Borkus says my salary
doesn't even cover the rent,

223
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:54,265
他对我特殊优待
so he pays the difference for me.

224
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,967
难道你不明白，Gregor?
Don't you get it, Gregor?

225
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:57,469
你是他的奴隶
You're his slave.

226
00:11:57,503 --> 00:11:59,671
我们需要找到你的归属
We need to figure out
who you really are,

227
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,273
你如何来到这里
how you got here.

228
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:04,376
你确定你不能记起任何事情？
Are you sure
you don't remember anything?

229
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:10,483
嗯，我记得我在一辆运输船上醒来
Well, all I remember is
waking up on a transport.

230
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:12,685
因为某种原因我们坠毁在ABAFAR星球
Somehow we crashed on Abafar.

231
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:16,956
还有，博克斯先生说我有健忘症
And, well, Mr. Borkus says
I have amnesia.

232
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,223
嗯
Hmm.

233
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:21,760
每个克隆人手腕上都有识别码
Every clone has an
identifying code on their wrist.

234
00:12:21,794 --> 00:12:24,429
你在军队服役的记录都在数据库里面
Your military records
will be in the database.

235
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:25,864
扫描他，R2
Scan him, Artoo.

236
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:27,299


237
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:35,042
真令人吃惊，
Impressive.

238
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:40,748
Gregor, 你的型号是CC-5576-39.
your designation
is CC-5576-39.

239
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:45,286
你曾在一支精英小分队里服役，上尉军衔
You were a captain
and part of an elite squad.

240
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:47,589
一个克隆人指挥官
A clone commando.

241
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:49,458


242
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:51,259
你的资料显示
Your file says you were reported

243
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:53,795
你在一次战斗中失踪
missing in action during

244
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:55,630
萨里斯战役
the Battle of Sarrish.

245
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:56,965


246
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:59,434
萨里斯?

247
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,436
萨里斯.

248
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,538
等一下

249
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:05,773
萨里斯战役是什么？
What was the Battle of Sarrish?

250
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:09,677
它是共和国军队损失惨重的战役之一
It was one of the Republic's
most devastating losses.

251
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:12,046
萨里斯战役

252
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:13,715
是的
Yes.

253
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:15,717
是的，我记起来了
Yes, I remember now.

254
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:18,186
很多士兵死亡
So many soldiers were dying.

255
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,590
你记得你是如何逃离萨里斯战役的吗？
Dodo you remember
how you escaped Sarrish?

256
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:24,693
记不起了
No.

257
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:28,998
我只记得一眼望去全是尸体
I just remember seeing all those bodies.

258
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:31,500
漫山遍野的尸体
Bodies everywhere.

259
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:33,402
我只记得我必须寻求帮助
I knew I had to get help.

260
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,606
但记忆就在这里中断了
But that's where the memory stops.

261
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:37,941
好吧，士兵
Well, soldier,

262
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:41,244
现在你对那场战役也帮不上什么忙
there's nothing you can do
about that battle now,

263
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,379
但你能帮助我们
but you can help us.

264
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:43,380


265
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:45,349
我们的任务全靠它了
Our mission depends on it.

266
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:55,793
嗯，上校，Gregor刚才说给他5分钟考虑
Uh, Colonel, Gregor said
to give him five minutes,

267
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:57,528
但现在已经6分钟了
but it has been six.

268
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:59,831
如果他不愿意加入我们怎么办？
What if he does not accept
your offer to join us?

269
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:01,333
那么我会回到那儿
Then I'll go back in there

270
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:04,036
亲自灌输一些理念给他
and personally
knock some sense into him.

271
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,037
那没必要吧
That won't be necessary.

272
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:06,238
Whoa!

273
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:07,639


274
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:09,608
让我的外表看起来象一个士兵
I figured
at least looking like a soldier

275
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,710
也许能带回更多的记忆
might bring back some more memories,

276
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:13,912
不管怎样，首先要找回我的装备
until we recover my equipment anyway.

277
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:16,115
我听到你们这些家伙的谈话
I overheard you guys talking.

278
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:18,383
我想我知道我的武器在哪了
I think I know where my armor is.

279
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:19,818
让我们检查一下餐厅
Let's go check out the diner.

280
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:31,864
动起来，士兵们。这不是舞会
Step it up, soldiers.
This isn't a party.

281
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:33,832
我们没有整晚的时间
We do not have all night.

282
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:38,737
再找这个？
Looking for this?

283
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:47,544
我的制服  我的装备
My uniform.
My equipment.

284
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,614
一直以来你都知道我是谁，而不告诉我
All this time you knew who I was
and didn't tell me.

285
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:51,615
为什么？
Why?

286
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,785
我不在乎你是谁
I don't care who you were.

287
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,687
你现在就是洗碗工
You are dishwasher now.

288
00:14:56,722 --> 00:15:00,793
而且是我把你从坠毁事故中救出来
And you owe me for saving you
from your crash.

289
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:03,396
你的命是我的，Gregor.
Your life is mine, Gregor.

290
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,164
你没有救我
You didn't save me.

291
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:07,199
你把我变成一个奴隶
You turned me into a slave.

292
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:09,702
我一直在这个垃圾场工作，听你发号施令
I've worked in this dump
taking orders from you

293
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:11,637
本来我应该为共和国而去战斗
when I could have been fighting
for the Republic.

294
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:13,239
我要恢复我自己的生活
I want my life back.

295
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,608
你想要你的自由，Gregor？
You want your freedom, Gregor?

296
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:17,877
从我这里拿起你的枪
Take your gun from me.

297
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:20,246
向我展示一下你是一个士兵
Show me you are a soldier.

298
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:21,413


299
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:22,748
明白了吗？
You see?

300
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:25,050
你不再是士兵
You are no soldier.

301
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:27,152
你是一个洗碗工
You are a dishwasher.

302
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:38,564
啊，你们这些破铜烂铁
Why, you no-good droids.

303
00:15:38,598 --> 00:15:41,800
放开我
Let go of me.

304
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:43,069
Agh! Oh.

305
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:45,537
Agh!

306
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,539
拿上你的东西，Gregor.
Take your things, Gregor.

307
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,941
我们一起离开这里
We're getting out of here.

308
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:53,345
别走，Gregor.
Don't leave, Gregor.

309
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,647
外面是浩渺无限的星系
It's a big galaxy out there,

310
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:57,149
比你想象的还要大
bigger than you know.

311
00:15:57,184 --> 00:16:00,152
留下来，你的生活很简单
Stay here, where your life is simple.

312
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:02,755
对这个克隆人来说
Simple isn't good enough anymore.

313
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:04,423
简单不再美好了
Not for this clone.

314
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:05,424
Ha!

315
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,993
你永远不能离开ABAFAR
You will never get off Abafar,

316
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:11,397
你和你的这些共和国朋友都如此
you and your little Republic friends,

317
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:14,767
你们的绝地巡逻舰爆炸之后就注定了
not after your Jedi cruiser blows up.

318
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:16,936
你究竟在讲什么？
What are you talking about?

319
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,241
你认为分离势力为什么来这里？
Why do you think the
Separatists bother coming here?

320
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:23,243
他们正在挖矿，名叫Rhydonium
They are mining our Rhydonium

321
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:26,513
把矿物装上自己的飞船，然后破坏你们的巡逻舰
to load on the shuttle
and destroy your ride home.

322
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,750
走着瞧
You will see.

323
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:33,152
你们全会困在这里
You will all be stuck here

324
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:36,923
乞求博克斯在他的餐厅留个工作岗位给自己
begging Borkus for a job in his diner.

325
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:39,959


326
00:16:58,213 --> 00:17:00,982
OK,让我们瞧瞧我们面对的是什么
Okay, let's see what we're up against.

327
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,050
Gregor.

328
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,823
等一下，那儿
Wait.
There.

329
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:12,059
有一艘巡洋舰在那边
There's a cruiser up there.

330
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:13,694
我想，就是那艘飞船
And that shuttle, I think--

331
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:17,530
是的，它正在装运矿物Rhydonium
Yes, it's being loaded up
with Rhydonium canisters.

332
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:20,901
Huh.

333
00:17:20,935 --> 00:17:22,069
我想博克斯先生
I guess Mr. Borkus

334
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:24,704
实际上没有说谎，至少这次如此
was actually telling
the truth...for once.

335
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,005
Rhydonium是什么矿物？
What exactly is Rhydonium?

336
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,439
它是一种能源矿
It's a fuel.

337
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:30,708
大部分产自ABAFAR这里
Mostly been mined out on Abafar.

338
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:32,409
极不稳定，而且危险
It's volatile and dangerous.

339
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:34,577


340
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:37,412
是的，现在我们有一个新任务：
Yes, we do have a new mission:

341
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:41,149
阻止分离势力炸毁那艘巡逻舰
Stop the Separatists
from blowing up that cruiser.

342
00:17:41,183 --> 00:17:42,917
上校，我会掩护你，清理出一条道路
I'll cover you
and clear the way, Colonel.

343
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:44,451
你们所有人直接冲上飞船
You all head straight to the shuttle.

344
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,253
我来对付那些铁皮人
I'll take care of those clankers.

345
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:48,955
嗯，听起来像个好计划
Hmm, sounds like a good plan.

346
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,691
你的士兵准备浴血奋战了吗？
You soldiers ready to get dangerous?

347
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:54,626


348
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:58,462
我会在飞船上和你碰头，先生
I'll meet you at the shuttle, sir.

349
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,430
我们出发
Let's roll.

350
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:08,537
Hey!

351
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:14,442
你需要授权进入这个区域
You need authorization
to enter this area.

352
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:15,443
Agh!

353
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:18,612
消灭他们！
Get them!

354
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:21,782
Agh!

355
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:38,330
干得好，Gregor.
Good job, Gregor.

356
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:46,570
看，他在那里！
Look, he's up there!

357
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:56,378
继续前进
Just keep moving.

358
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:57,646
一切尽在控制中
It is all under control.

359
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:08,289
我开始记得我有多么憎恨这些家伙
I'm beginning to remember
how much I hate these guys.

360
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,529
嘿，我不能识别那些太空人
Hey, I don't recognize those astromechs.

361
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:16,664
干掉他们！
Blast them!

362
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,066
他们在冲向我们
They are on to us.

363
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:23,036
上校，你能听见我说话吗？
Colonel, can you hear me?

364
00:19:23,104 --> 00:19:25,205
自求多福！
Save yourselves!

365
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:27,040
Okay.
Whoa!

366
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:28,041
Agh!

367
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:30,643
Whoa-oh-oh.

368
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:33,645
[blasters firing]

369
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:43,154
每个人都到这了吗？
Did everybody make it?

370
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:45,690
不，铁皮人和上校还在外面
No, Beezee and the colonel
are still out there.

371
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:48,025
发动飞船引擎
Get the shuttle ready to roll.

372
00:19:51,964 --> 00:19:53,398
Agh!

373
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:57,401
上校，你没事吧？
Colonel, you all right?

374
00:19:57,436 --> 00:19:59,970
我也许不能活着回去了
I'll never make it back alive.

375
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:01,406
不，你可以的，先生
Yes, you will, sir.

376
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,940
我天生就注定要这样
This is what I was born to do.

377
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:04,709
快,趁现在还不晚
Now, go before it's too late.

378
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,398
我很高兴能和你一起战斗，上校
It's been an honor
serving with you, Colonel.

379
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:33,569
R2说得对
Artoo's right.

380
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:35,771
我们可以打个回马枪，再把你接回去
We can swing back around
and pick you up.

381
00:20:35,806 --> 00:20:38,474
别担心我
Don't worry about me.

382
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:40,409
你让我记得我是谁
You made me remember who I am.

383
00:20:40,443 --> 00:20:42,244
我发誓，我会回家的
I'll make my way home.
I promise.

384
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,412
现在，出发！
Now go!

385
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:48,818
Gregor在哪？
Where is Gregor?

386
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:50,819
Gregor在哪？
Where is Gregor?

387
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:53,689
他在履行一个士兵的义务
He's doing what a soldier does:

388
00:20:53,723 --> 00:20:57,326
牺牲他自己，换取其他战友的生命
sacrificing himself
for the lives of others.

389
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:23,821
你将会被铭记在心。Gregor上尉
You will be remembered, Captain Gregor.

390

我们会把你的英雄事迹在共和国内传播

back to the Republic,

391
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:30,763
我们会等待你的回归
and we will watch for your return.
