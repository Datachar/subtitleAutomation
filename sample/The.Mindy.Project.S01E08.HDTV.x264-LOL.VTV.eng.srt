<i>With that, I will leave,</i>

175
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:58,712
because there's absolutely
no reason for me to stay.

176
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,030
Wait.

177
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:04,918
I think you should take that.

178
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:07,637
Just...
It's kind of in the way.

179
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:10,373
<i>Et tu,</i> Morgan?

180
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:13,310
No, that's the only one,
I think.

181
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,729
Have fun.

182
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,460
[Sighs]

183
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,230
Is your neck hurting?

184
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,599
Yeah.
I maybe got a little crick.

185
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,067
Mm.

186
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:26,235
Let's see.

187
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,187
May I?
Sure.

188
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,023
Why don't we close your eyes,
take a deep breath?

189
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,843
Count to three in your head
but not out loud.

190
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:35,111
Whoop!

191
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:36,412
Oop.

192
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:37,813
That's better.

193
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,031
I think the problem
was your chair.

194
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,983
It took billions of years
of evolution

195
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,418
to perfect the human neck.

196
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,203
Chairs have only been around
for a mere eye-blink

197
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,088
of that time frame.

198
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:48,674
Brendan Deslaurier.

199
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,260
From downtown women's
holistic birth center.

200
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:52,628
Oh, no.

201
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,496
Oh, yes. It's hard to believe
we work right up there,

202
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,349
and this is the first time
we've met, right?

203
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,550
[Sighs]

204
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,635
This is my brother,
business partner, best friend,

205
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:01,003
and tennis coach,
Duncan.

206
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,605
Hi.
Hi.

207
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,807
What kind of plant you got there, buddy?
<i>Checking.</i>

208
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,393
Does this plant have a utility,
or is it strictly decorative?

209
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,695
One time I put sunglasses
and a hat on it.

210
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,280
That's hilarious.

211
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:13,482
I think
you two should leave.

212
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:16,869
But thanks again for fixing
my neck, Dr. Deslaurier.

213
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,705
(Danny) They're not doctors,
they're midwives.

214
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,906
Oh, hello, Danny.

215
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,709
I'd prefer
if you call me Dr. Castellano.

216
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,995
I've always found "doctor"
to be such a formality.

217
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:27,330
It's so distancing.

218
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,048
You know what?
You're right. It is distancing.

219
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:33,219
It's the distance
between actual doctors like me

220
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,421
and quacks
like you and your brother.

221
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,506
Isn't that right, Dr. Reed?

222
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:38,474
Dr. Reed?

223
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:39,842
He left.

224
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:42,044
I think he was embarrassed
about being a drug dealer.

225
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,180
Not this again.
They're prescriptions.

226
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,382
And prescriptions
are little pieces of paper

227
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,517
that one trades in
for narcotics,

228
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,269
making this lovely establishment
not different

229
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,737
from the hacienda
of Pablo Escobar.

230
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,323
Hey, pal, I went
to Columbia medical school.

231
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:56,442
I got into Columbia.
Didn't go.

232
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,277
Walked the campus,
got a bad vibe.

233
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,562
Did you know that midwifery
predates obstetrics

234
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,581
by multiple millennia?
Mm-hmm.

235
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,034
So I ask you this, Danny...
Confucius, the Buddha,

236
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:07,569
Jesus Christ,
even sting himself...

237
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,739
Were they birthed by ob-gyns?

238
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,125
Should've been.
Mm.

239
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,495
Shoulda, woulda, coulda.
Is that doctor terminology?

240
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,098
I just don't understand
that stuff, so...

241
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,416
By the way,
I hear there's a holdup

242
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:24,220
on transferring some files
upstairs to our new clients.

243
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:26,022
But you'll take care of that,
right, Danny?

244
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,858
It's a great place you got here.
Nice layout.

245
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:31,360
Good to know
in case we decide to expand.

246
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:33,979
Duncan, shall we?

247
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,564
Toodles.

248
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,149
<i>Dr. C!</i>

249
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,201
Who were those guys?
They were cool.

250
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:40,619
They're midwives,
so let's not...

251
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,937
They're not cool.

252
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,572
They're midwives
with attitude.

253
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:45,041
All right,
keep up the good work.

254
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,325
You keep up your good work.

255
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:47,877
Ha!

256
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,695
I'm worried about him.

257
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:53,883
Guys, listen, they just decided
that they're gonna make

258
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:55,134
all the decisions
for the practice.

259
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,053
And they took a vote,
majority rule.

260
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:58,838
Hello? I thought we lived
in a democracy.

261
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,789
Well, we're just happy
that you could make our day out.

262
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,757
Okay,
may I say something?

263
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,059
It's just my opinion.

264
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:05,561
Your co-workers sound sexist,
misogynist...

265
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:07,680
And, yeah, I'll say it...
Borderline racist.

266
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:09,515
You think everyone's
borderline racist.

267
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,067
Gwen, we should listen to her,
all right?

268
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:12,902
She is the worldly one.
Mm-hmm.

269
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:16,072
I'm like the kind of fun,
cool, single one.

270
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:17,440
And you're the, um...
The cool mom.

271
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,276
Excuse me. I did date
a drug dealer in college.

272
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,911
You have been milking that
for years.

273
00:09:21,912 --> 00:09:24,080
Mindy, you need to move
to Europe.

274
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:25,614
Let me put it this way.
Do you like good food?

275
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,166
Mm-hmm.
Do you like art?

276
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,667
Yep.
Do you like uncircumcised penises?

277
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:29,818
Hey.
Hey!

278
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,818
Excuse me. Hello.
We're in a restaurant.

279
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,588
I mean,
they're everywhere.

280
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:33,706
Here's the thing
I'm worried about.

281
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:34,874
I get there,
no one speaks English,

282
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,991
my hair dryer doesn't work,

283
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,326
someone tries to pin
a drug thing on me.

284
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,427
Oh.
It happens.

285
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:40,346
Guys, I'm getting
a little worried.

286
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,430
I should go back to work.

287
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,798
Absolutely not.
No, no, no, no, no.

288
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,468
You need one day where you
suck the marrow out of life

289
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:46,969
and, like, let it slosh around
in your mouth.

290
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,471
Ew! Gross!

291
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,939
You need this.

292
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:52,975
You know what?
She's right. You need this.

293
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:55,728
Guys, you haven't agreed
on anything since, um...

294
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,279
Oh, Colin firth
being bangable.

295
00:09:57,314 --> 00:09:59,615
Oh, I want to lick his face.
I would destroy him.

296
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:00,866
Okay.

297
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,285
This country is succumbing

298
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,738
to an epidemic
of over-medication.

299
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,040
<i>That's what
the midwives said.</i>

300
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,292
Also, they put smooth rocks
in their bathroom sink.

301
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:11,577
You want rocks?

302
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:13,496
I'm going to a quarry
after work.

303
00:10:13,497 --> 00:10:15,331
I'll have rocks coming out
your freakin' eyes.

304
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,916
No, no, no.

305
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,385
Mrs. DeSouza, could we have
but five minutes of your time?

306
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,537
Legally, we have to give
your file back.

307
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,423
But I think you're gonna like
what we have to say.

308
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,474
With all due respect,

309
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,560
you have no idea
how stupid that sounds.

310
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:28,844
Whoa!
Oh, all right.

311
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,596
We don't even know
what's in these vaccines.

312
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,880
Excuse me?
Whoa, Danny.

313
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,549
Uh, okay.
Uh, he didn't mean that.

314
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,651
You're not stupid, obviously.
You're brilliant.

315
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:37,219
No, of course.
I'm... I'm... I'm...

316
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,654
I'm not calling you stupid.
I'm calling...

317
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,489
Denying your baby
Western medicine...

318
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,057
That's extremely stupid.

319
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,025
That's not much better.

320
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,660
Uh, allow me...

321
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:45,911
If I may.

322
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,897
Maybe you recognize me
from our taxi cab ads...

323
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,618
Shulman & associates...
We put women first.

324
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:54,203
I didn't see your ad.

325
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,372
Didn't? I looked pretty good.
Never mind.

326
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,707
The point is we both know you're
not going anywhere, all right?

327
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,292
So why don't we pop
you in those stirrups

328
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,094
and take a damn good peek.

329
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,797
That came out wrong.
Oh, my...

330
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:06,015
Ahh.

331
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,917
What if I told you
it was 20% off?

332
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,469
25%...

333
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:18,170
♪ bumpin' loud as hell now

334
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:20,172
♪ we need to play,
need to play, need to play ♪

335
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:21,924
Okay, here he is.

336
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,792
This is the guy I'm dating.
Isn't he such a babe?

337
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,210
His name is Josh.
Josh.

338
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:26,378
He looks hairless.

339
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:27,763
I like body hair.

340
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:29,298
You know,
I like to be reminded

341
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:30,682
that he's a mammal
when I'm in his arms.

342
00:11:30,717 --> 00:11:32,050
Alex, that's weird.
Wait a minute.

343
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:33,969
Did you take a picture of him
when he was sleeping?

344
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:36,054
Yeah, of course.
What is wrong with you?

345
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:37,723
What do you mean,
what is wrong with me?
