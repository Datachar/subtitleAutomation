1
00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:02,610
Uh, once again,

2
00:00:02,644 --> 00:00:04,878
some three hours ago,
President Grant was shot.

3
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:07,346
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

4
00:00:07,364 --> 00:00:09,065
The FBI is issuing a high alert,

5
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:11,984
and they... they do have
a description of a suspect.

6
00:00:12,118 --> 00:00:13,786
- Ms. Pope?
- Yes.

7
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:15,420
- Are you... back?
- Yes.

8
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:18,023
I'm back,
for as long as you need me.

9
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:19,842
The vice President is making a play.

10
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:21,226
She spent the last two hours
lobbying cabinet members

11
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:24,096
- about signing over the
presidency to her. - She what?

12
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,231
(Reed) President Sally
Langston makes history today

13
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,917
as the first female
commander in chief.

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,020
<i>Good morning.</i>

15
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:33,655
<i>First, let me say</i>
<i>that all that I have</i>

16
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,107
<i>I would give</i>
<i>not to be here today.</i>

17
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,960
<i>Like all of you,</i>
<i>my thoughts and prayers</i>

18
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:40,846
<i>are with the President</i>
<i>and his wife and children.</i>

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,215
<i>The doctors at James Madison</i>
<i>hospital have informed me</i>

20
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:46,851
<i>that President Grant's</i>
<i>condition remains critical.</i>

21
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,289
<i>The doctors have been candid,</i>
<i>and I will be, too.</i>

22
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:53,659
<i>They hope the President will</i>
<i>wake up within a few days.</i>

23
00:00:53,693 --> 00:00:56,294
<i>If and when he does,</i>
<i>they may not know</i>

24
00:00:56,312 --> 00:00:58,063
<i>the extent of the damage</i>
<i>to his brain</i>

25
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:01,433
<i>for at least a couple of weeks,</i>
<i>maybe longer.</i>

26
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,669
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>we have extended the manhunt</i>

27
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:05,587
<i>for the person</i>
<i>or persons responsible</i>

28
00:01:05,622 --> 00:01:07,539
<i>for the attack</i>
<i>on the President.</i>

29
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:10,842
<i>I have directed the leaders</i>
<i>of the FBI, Homeland Security,</i>

30
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,295
<i>and the CIA to pursue</i>
<i>every avenue,</i>

31
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,846
<i>run every threat to ground,</i>

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,616
<i>until we have captured</i>
<i>whoever is responsible</i>

33
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,701
<i>for this evil act.</i>
(Breaths heavily)

34
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:22,253
The person they're looking for,

35
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:25,172
the one they think
shot the President...

36
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:26,307
That's me.

37
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:32,363
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

38
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:35,467
Sync and corrections by bellows
www.addic7ed.com

39
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:39,370
I'm gonna need to talk to
Colonel Jessup over at M.D.W.

40
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:41,489
He's the chief of ceremonies
and special events.

41
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,440
Call D.H.S. and justice.
(Cell phone ringing)

42
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,776
Tell them to be here
at 1:00 P.M. for a briefing.

43
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:47,428
Hold on. What?

44
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:48,846
- You need to get back here.
- I can't.

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,197
In fact, I'm staying on
for a while longer.

46
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:52,016
- I'm not asking.
- Whatever it is, deal with it.

47
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,484
- I'm not asking.
- What is it?

48
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,037
Can't say. Open line.

49
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:57,388
Harrison, I'm in the middle
of something.

50
00:01:57,422 --> 00:01:58,472
I will call you...

51
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:00,274
Get your ass back here <i>now.</i>

52
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:04,378
(Cell phone beeps)

53
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:06,464
I'll be back in an hour.

54
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:08,733
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

55
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:16,373
Huck.

56
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,826
I think she relapsed.
We need to find her.

57
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,394
You have to help me.

58
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:23,996
(Voice echoing) I messed up.
I'm in trouble, Huck.

59
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,315
I mean, you have to come.

60
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,951
She's in
a lot of trouble.

61
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:29,569
When did Becky call you?

62
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,554
Oh. Yesterday or the day before.
I was talking to Quinn.

63
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:35,041
<i>It was registered</i>
<i>to Verna Thornton.</i>

64
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:36,626
<i>The supreme court justice?</i>

65
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,777
<i>She's one of Olivia's clients,</i>
<i>right?</i>

66
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:40,479
(Cell phone rings)

67
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:41,680
(Ring)

68
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,083
(Beep)

69
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,001
Becky? What's wrong?

70
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:48,102
She was crying, scared.

71
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,220
I don't know what to do.

72
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:50,822
Can you come get me, please?

73
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:53,024
She gave me a room number,
and I went.

74
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:53,992
To the Stanworth.

75
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:55,794
Room 807.

76
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:57,545
<i>Uh, the door was open.</i>

77
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,297
(Knock on door)

78
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:03,300
Becky?

79
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:04,635
<i>But she wasn't there.</i>

80
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:14,095
(Beeps and whirs)

81
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,980
(Multiple gunshots)

82
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:17,465
(Crowd screaming)

83
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,200
I'm new to the field of
remote-controlled sniper rifles.

84
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,185
Is there a trade magazine
they send out to enthusiasts,

85
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,987
psychopaths, assassins?

86
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:26,089
There's a camera
in the scope.

87
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,441
The movement operates
on a radio signal.

88
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,910
It's the same technology you use
to fly model airplanes.

89
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:33,279
You can find it at any
toy store, electronics store.

90
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,613
It's untraceable.

91
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,581
What's its range?

92
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,467
Depends on
if they bounce the signal.

93
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:40,653
It could be 50 feet,
it could be 2 states away.

94
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,838
What did you do?

95
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:43,656
What I'm trained to do.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,567
<i>I couldn't find</i>
<i>the fifth cartridge,</i>

97
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:57,035
<i>but I couldn't spare</i>
<i>another second,</i>

98
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,171
<i>so I ran down the stairs</i>

99
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,289
<i>and snuck out</i>
<i>of the service entrance.</i>

100
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,040
(Alarm blaring) Why disable the gun?
Why take it?

101
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:03,542
If someone found you with it...

102
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,427
It could help us find who did
this and who took Becky.

103
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:07,095
Every gun has a story.

104
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,747
What did you do with it?

105
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,607
So that's the...

106
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:20,309
That's the gun
that shot the President.

107
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:35,284
Rebecca Flynn...
Born January 17, 1982.

108
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:36,385
Freelance graphic designer.

109
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,020
Works out of a shared space
on 9th street.

110
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:40,923
Attends A.A. meetings
at a church on Florida Avenue.

111
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:42,490
- It's where we met.
- She's an alcoholic?

112
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:44,159
- Cocaine.
- You're an alcoholic?

113
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:46,962
I have an addiction,
but not to drugs or alcohol.

114
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,430
(Olivia) When was the
last time you saw her?

115
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:49,798
Thursday morning.

116
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,767
- You've known her for how long?
- Three months.

117
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,552
Huck, I know you love this girl,
but I have to ask...

118
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:56,104
Is there any chance she was
involved in setting you up?

119
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,639
No.

120
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,674
I'm trained to detect lying,
and all that aside, I know her.

121
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,443
I know she would
never do that to me.

122
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:03,345
Never. She's in trouble.
Someone grabbed her

123
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:05,898
to lure her to that hotel.
They knew I would come for her.

124
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:06,649
Someone has her.

125
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:09,117
Someone professional
who kills for a living,

126
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:11,787
who's good enough to do it
with a remote sniper rifle.

127
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:13,855
Someone like you?
That's what you mean, right?

128
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:15,490
- Someone like you.
- Quinn.

129
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,793
I need to find Becky before
they decide she's disposable.

130
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:18,911
And...

131
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:21,529
She's a nice person.

132
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:23,248
- I need to find her.
- Okay. So we find her,

133
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:25,083
connect the dots,
find out who she talked to,

134
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:26,151
- where she went.
-I'm going, too.

135
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,703
- No. You stay here.
- There's no way in hell.

136
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:29,021
You're the most wanted man
in America.

137
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:30,973
The FBI has sketches of you
everywhere. You stay here.

138
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:33,742
You do not move.
You do not leave this office.

139
00:05:33,777 --> 00:05:35,978
Huck, look at me.

140
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:37,112
Look at me.

141
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,699
Do not leave this office.

142
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:45,504
The FBI sketch is based
on one individual's description

143
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,339
on what is being described
thus far

144
00:05:47,374 --> 00:05:49,425
as a person of interest
in the events surrounding

145
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:52,261
the shooting of President Grant
and Britta Kagen.

146
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,996
For further details
on the investigation,

147
00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:55,831
I'd like to turn the podium over

148
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:57,716
to the Attorney General
and her team of investigators.

149
00:05:57,767 --> 00:05:59,802
(Camera shutters clicking)

150
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:01,670
David.

151
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:03,238
The sketch is the result
of an eyewitness

152
00:06:03,256 --> 00:06:04,906
who saw the suspect
with a red hoodie

153
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,875
pull the fire alarm
on the eighth floor.

154
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,576
We are going through
hotel security footage now

155
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:09,995
to look for leads.

156
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,080
<i>Facial recognition software is</i>
<i>being used</i>

157
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:14,633
<i>to seek a match</i>
<i>with every record available.</i>

158
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:17,085
I'm leaving the cabinet briefings

159
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:19,855
and the White House
schedule on your desk.

160
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,691
Also the minutes from
yesterday's N.S.A. meetings.

161
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:24,393
I figure I would patch you

162
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,594
- into the White House for any intel
updates. - Don't bother.

163
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:29,398
Just because President Langston...
I'm sorry.

164
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:32,401
Just because that woman
kicked you out of your office,

165
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:33,568
doesn't mean you can't move

166
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,870
to another office
in the White House.

167
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:36,955
I have another office, Mary.
You're standing in it.

168
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,658
And I'm not leaving here
until President Grant...

169
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:40,942
The only President
of this great nation...

170
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,777
leaves his hospital bed.
(Telephone ringing)

171
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:45,080
<i>(Woman) That the shooter</i>
<i>most likely has...</i>

172
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,049
- Are you getting that?
- No.

173
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,668
- Mary. - That's your home phone.
I don't answer your home phone.

174
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:52,387
Because unlike you,
I still work at the White House.

175
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:54,056
(Door opens)
(Ring)

176
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,841
Okay. (Mutters)

177
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:57,259
(Ring)

178
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:58,393
Hello?

179
00:06:58,428 --> 00:07:00,646
Mrs. Novak?

180
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,348
No. I'm not at work.

181
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,399
(Coughs)

182
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:06,968
Yes, I... (Sighs)

183
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:08,236
Yes, I know with everything
that's going on,

184
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,038
you would think they
need me, but they don't.

185
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:12,941
So I have time to talk to my
very favorite mother-in-law.

186
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:15,344
Yes, I hope the President
pulls through, too.

187
00:07:15,378 --> 00:07:17,629
No. James isn't here right now.
He's at work.

188
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:19,831
Yeah. They need him at work.

189
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,616
Did you want me
to give him a message?

190
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:25,754
His next visit? I don't know.
Probably not for a while.

191
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:28,974
Because he was just up there
last weekend.

192
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:33,178
James did not come and visit you
and his dad this past weekend?

193
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:36,515
No.

194
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:39,067
I guess that's my mistake.

195
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:40,736
Yes.

196
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,922
I'll have him call as soon
as he gets back home.

197
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:47,024
<i>I'm standing in your cubicle.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

198
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:48,309
<i>Oh, my dad's having</i>
<i>one of those days</i>

199
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,794
<i>where he thinks</i>
<i>I'm his Uncle krystof.</i>

200
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:52,113
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>
<i>Anything I can do?</i>

201
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:53,280
<i>No. If it's okay with you,</i>
<i>though,</i>

202
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:54,381
<i>I think I'll spend</i>
<i>the night here.</i>

203
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,549
<i>No. No. Of course.</i>

204
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:56,684
<i>Yeah. Whatever you need.</i>

205
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:57,885
<i>Thanks.</i>

206
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:00,554
Bye.

207
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:02,890
(Beep)

208
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:05,225
James.

209
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,326
David, hey.

210
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,578
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

211
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,313
You told me last night you found
something in Ohio, but you

212
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:11,465
didn't say what it was, and now
you're not returning my calls.

213
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:12,834
Is it something about Cytron?

214
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,135
- Look, I-I really can't talk about
this right now. - Why?

215
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:16,386
Because it's complicated,

216
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:19,139
especially...
Especially in light of this.

217
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:20,506
The assassination attempt?

218
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:22,459
I know that it sounds vague,
but you just have to trust me.

219
00:08:22,493 --> 00:08:23,977
Fine. But if it has
anything to do

220
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,046
with the President getting shot,
anything at all...

221
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,814
You'll be the first to know.

222
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,451
Madam President,
I am humbled

223
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:34,036
and truly honored
to stand before

224
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:37,089
the first female President
of these United States.

225
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:37,941
Very kind.

226
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,393
Ma'am, I'm not one to
speak out of school, but...

227
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:41,844
Oh, well, hell...
Excuse my French.

228
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:43,996
We both know if I'm breathing,
I'm speaking out of school,

229
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:45,564
but it's my pure belief

230
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:48,367
you didn't get your
proper due as V.P.

231
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,018
There. Said.

232
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,871
Well, my position has had
its, uh, challenges.

233
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:55,507
Now can we get
to your business, Hollis?

234
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,943
Whatever stretch
the almighty has in mind

235
00:08:57,977 --> 00:08:59,844
for you to now lead
this great land...

236
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:02,414
Be it a week, a month,
or longer...

237
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:04,032
You were put here
for a purpose,

238
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:05,617
sure as he made the world.

239
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:08,937
And that purpose is to make
yourself some history.

240
00:09:08,988 --> 00:09:11,240
That is,
if you're so inclined.

241
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:15,911
Might be time to pay a visit
to Verna Thornton.

242
00:09:17,763 --> 00:09:20,064
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

243
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:23,067
Nothing knocked over
or even askew.

244
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:25,469
If Becky was abducted,
it wasn't from here.

245
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,171
Still holding?

246
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:28,806
The President was shot. They're
a little busy at justice.

247
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,591
But don't worry. My guy's solid.
Owes me big-time.

248
00:09:30,642 --> 00:09:34,077
Yeah, Jim. Listen, that security
footage at the Stanworth hotel

249
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:35,929
before and after the shooting...
I'm gonna need a copy.

250
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:37,347
So I'm gonna have to call in
that favor.

251
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:39,883
Dude, I made that D.U.I.
go away. I saved you 12 grand.

252
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,568
No, this is exactly
the kind of thing

253
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:43,152
people mean when they say,
"I owe you."

254
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,788
Wait. Wait.

255
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:46,156
(Beep)
He hung up.

256
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,474
- Wow. Mr. Big time.
- They're on lockdown.

257
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:50,328
They're not releasing anything
to anyone for any reason.

258
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:53,514
I may have someone I can call.

259
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:56,499
(Keyboard keys clicking)

260
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,067
Any luck with
the hotel security feed?

261
00:09:58,101 --> 00:10:00,453
Uh, the FBI pulled it.
I'm seeing if they have it cached.

262
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:03,006
(Sighs) So I guess
we're both patsies then.

263
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,159
Me for the Cytron explosion,
you for shooting the President.

264
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,328
Makes you wonder
if they're related.

265
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:09,280
What do you mean?

266
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:11,113
I mean, whoever set me up
for the Cytron explosion

267
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:13,416
must've been pretty unhappy
I slipped through their fingers.

268
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,401
If they knew you were the guy
who took me,

269
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:17,720
first of all, they'd be pissed,
but more importantly,

270
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:20,322
if they did their homework,
they'd know you were ex-CIA,

271
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,674
and who better to pin
an assassination on

272
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,775
than someone who's been tossed
aside by the government?

273
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:26,361
So who were they, Huck?
Who set me up?

274
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:28,263
- I don't know. - You don't know
because you never asked

275
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:29,331
or you don't know
because you're still

276
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:30,866
pretending it wasn't you

277
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:32,768
who flew me cross-country
in Verna Thornton's jet

278
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:35,137
and dumped me in a D.C. hotel
room with a brand-new identity?

279
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:36,739
I never asked.

280
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:40,258
(Computer beeping)

281
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:44,646
A woman tells you to kidnap
someone and you don't ask why?

282
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:47,332
Is Olivia Pope really worth
that kind of loyalty?

283
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,450
My girlfriend is missing,
and I'm trying to find her.

284
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:50,751
Are you gonna help me or not?

285
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:54,088
(Typing on keyboard)

286
00:10:58,961 --> 00:10:59,927
Hey.

287
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:01,496
Hey.

288
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:06,099
Hotel security footage
for the last 72 hours.

289
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,385
(Sets flash drive down)

290
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:21,898
Thanks.

291
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:43,036
(Door opens and closes)

292
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,421
I mean, Becky's only been
at her job for three months.

293
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,123
Her credit cards...
All opened three months ago.

294
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,808
And get this, she's been
dating Huck for exactly...

295
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,476
Three months.

296
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:53,763
Abby, what is it?

297
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,663
She went into the hotel alone.

298
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:14,766
Well, she could have been
meeting her dealer upstairs.

299
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,517
No way to tell.

300
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:17,703
Security cameras on the eighth
floor were all messed with.

301
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,154
Huck, I checked her phone.

302
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:20,873
No calls to or from any dealers

303
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,975
or anyone, for that matter.
Only you, Huck.

304
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,542
For the entire three months
she had that phone,

305
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:25,760
she only called you.

306
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:27,429
That doesn't prove anything.
She was getting sober.

307
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:29,981
She left her whole life behind
and moved here to get sober.

308
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,267
- She doesn't have a lot of friends.
- We checked her bank statements.

309
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,636
She kept exactly the amount she
needed to pay rent and utilities

310
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,537
in that account.
Never wrote any other checks.

311
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:38,190
Huck...

312
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:40,308
Becky doesn't exist.

313
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,826
Yes, she does.

314
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,645
- She set you up, Huck.
- No, she'd never do that.

315
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,963
- I'm sorry.
- You made a mistake.

316
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,965
- I'm gonna find her.
- Olivia said you don't leave here.

317
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:49,367
- Who's gonna stop me?
- You don't leave here.

318
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,785
I am a trained killer.

319
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:52,303
Do you understand that?

320
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:54,656
You leave here,
you gotta go through me.

321
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,759
You missed something.

322
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:01,279
You are wrong about Becky,
so you are of no help to me.

323
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,413
None of you.

324
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,398
I'm taking care of this myself.

325
00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:16,577
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

326
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,648
(Thudding)

327
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,418
(Hollow thud)

328
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:01,855
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

329
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:05,716
(Projector clicks)

330
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,934
(Click)

331
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:12,523
(Click)

332
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:15,193
(Click)

333
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:27,179
(Click)

334
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:45,258
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

335
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:47,344
Madam President.

336
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:48,812
Hello, justice Thornton.

337
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,430
I heard you were feeling
under the weather.

338
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:51,598
Though "under the weather"

339
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:54,234
really doesn't quite
cover it, does it?

340
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:59,189
Is there something
I can do for you?

341
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:00,673
You can take care of yourself,

342
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,125
for your own good,

343
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,326
for the good of the country.

344
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,061
You can focus on your health,

345
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:07,197
concentrate your energies
on getting better.

346
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:09,465
Such a stressful job
can't be good for you

347
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:10,233
at a time like this.

348
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:12,352
I am not stepping down
from the bench.

349
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:16,538
Justice Thornton, your President
is making a request of you.

350
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:19,074
Wouldn't be patriotic
not to acquiesce.

351
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:22,327
You're gonna be President
for about the next 15 minutes

352
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:23,595
and then your time
will be done,

353
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,364
and I will be still be
on the bench.

354
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:28,117
If I have to rule from
the confines of an iron lung,

355
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:30,502
I will be on the bench.

356
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,954
The seat your butt is filling
on the supreme court

357
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:35,290
belongs to me to fill
as I see fit.

358
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:37,258
It was promised to me
during the campaign.

359
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:39,627
It is mine,
and I mean to have it,

360
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:42,063
and for someone other than
a left-wing, baby-killing,

361
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:45,233
homosexual loving, godless
creature such as yourself.

362
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:47,152
I want it now,
and you will give it to me,

363
00:15:47,186 --> 00:15:48,653
because if you don't,

364
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:51,388
I will leak to one of
your liberal media papers

365
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:52,774
that you have terminal cancer,

366
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:55,909
that you had terminal cancer
during the confirmation hearings,

367
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,795
that you lied by omission
about having terminal cancer

368
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:00,247
to the American people,

369
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:03,033
that the drugs coursing
through your system...

370
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:06,736
Including the medical marijuana
pills you take at night...

371
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:09,940
May possibly have clouded
your judicial judgment.

372
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:13,093
I will call into question every
decision you have ever made

373
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,462
from the bench of
the highest court in the land.

374
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:16,980
I will disgrace you
in the eyes of your peers

375
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:18,698
and in the annals of history.

376
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:21,785
I will ruin what little time
you have left on this earth,

377
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:23,003
and I will be right to do so

378
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:25,021
because it is
the God's honest truth.

379
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:32,429
Step down from the bench, Verna.

380
00:16:32,463 --> 00:16:35,248
I'm asking you nicely.

381
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:39,669
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

382
00:16:40,704 --> 00:16:42,304
It's nice that you
came home for lunch.

383
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:44,974
Well, I have to admit,
I was a little worried

384
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:46,158
about what I might find
when I came home.

385
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:47,443
I mean, it's been four hours

386
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:48,694
without a political hit
in your veins.

387
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:49,979
Thought you might be huddled
in the corner,

388
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,797
mainlining c-span and trying
to snort shredded pieces

389
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:53,932
of the congressional record
up your nose.

390
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,201
- But you're fine.
- Oh, I'm good. I'm very good.

391
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:58,004
A little time off was
just what I needed.

392
00:16:59,238 --> 00:17:01,757
So...

393
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:03,708
H-how did you say
your dad was doing?

394
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,376
- Hmm?
- Your dad.

395
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:07,445
You had to spend that night
at his house the other day.

396
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:08,663
And we never had a chance
to talk about it,

397
00:17:08,698 --> 00:17:10,699
because, well,
all hell broke loose

398
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:12,267
with Fitz and the shooting,

399
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,303
so I was wondering, how is
your father doing? Better?

400
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,638
Worse?

401
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:18,089
Oh, about the same, I guess.

402
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:19,791
This could really use
some mustard. You want?

403
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:22,093
No, I'm good.

404
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:48,152
There. That's him.

405
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,337
Same red sweatshirt as the man
seen pulling the fire alarm.

406
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:52,022
And he's heading up
to the eighth floor,

407
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,758
which is where the shots
were fired from.

408
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:56,043
- But no clear angle on his face?
- No clear angle on his face,

409
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:57,895
and the cameras on the eighth
floor were tampered with,

410
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,681
so we don't have any footage of
him from there. However, ma'am,

411
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,366
if you'll focus your attention
back on the monitor...

412
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:07,871
There. See? He picks up
that woman's cell phone.

413
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:09,973
And presumably left
his fingerprints on it.

414
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:11,941
Have you located
the woman yet?

415
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,560
We're looking for her now.

416
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:17,447
Huck's fingerprints...

417
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:19,666
Find out if they're
in any government databases.

418
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,334
- Okay, but first...
- The FBI has

419
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,969
security footage of Huck
picking up someone's phone

420
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:24,587
in the hotel elevator.

421
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,889
- Okay, but...
- If they find the phone, they'll have

422
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:28,858
his prints, so we need to know if
they'll be able to match them.

423
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:30,526
If that's the case, we track
down this woman and take

424
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,145
her phone before the FBI
can get their hands on it.

425
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,896
Liv, Huck's gone.

426
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:34,964
What?

427
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,572
(Girls speaking indistinctly)

428
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:45,475
(Girls laugh)

429
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:51,196
<i>Sundays is pasta</i>
<i>and mondays is sandwiches,</i>

430
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,098
<i>but tonight...</i>
<i>Tonight's my favorite night.</i>

431
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,868
<i>They eat pizza</i>
<i>and they play games.</i>

432
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,003
<i>That's the best part.</i>
<i>It's game night.</i>

433
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,688
<i>She's Carol, 34,</i>

434
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,041
<i>not a natural blonde,</i>
<i>but that's okay.</i>

435
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,643
<i>She teaches math</i>
<i>at the junior high.</i>

436
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,529
<i>And he's Billy.</i>
<i>He sells sporting goods,</i>

437
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,865
<i>which is an actual thing...</i>
<i>Sporting goods.</i>

438
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,233
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

439
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:14,652
<i>And the little girls</i>
<i>are Lucy... she's 8,</i>

440
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,372
<i>and Sarah Beth... she's 10.</i>

441
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,856
<i>So what about you?</i>

442
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,441
<i>What do you like to do?</i>

443
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,463
(Billy chuckles)
Let me get that.

444
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,775
(Rustling)

445
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:55,777
(Gun cocks)

446
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,580
Hi, Huck.

447
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:12,756
What, you're not speaking to me now?

448
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,041
- You set me up.
- Yeah, I set you up.

449
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:15,808
Who hired you?

450
00:20:15,843 --> 00:20:17,143
You know I can't tell you that.

451
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:19,712
Professional ethics.
Gal's gotta have standards.

452
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:20,763
Who are you?

453
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:23,949
I'm Becky, like "Rebecca
of Sunnybrook Farm."

454
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:26,535
Nice to meet you, Huck
of "Huckleberry Finn."

455
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:27,869
Is today the day
I'm gonna die?

456
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:29,321
Because I'd like to know
ahead of time.

457
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:30,956
I'm not here to kill you.
Why would I kill you?

458
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,841
We're the same, you and me.

459
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,327
Except that I shot the President.
That's a big job.

460
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:36,778
You want me to go down for this.

461
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:38,680
Come on. Don't you think if I
wanted you to go down for this,

462
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:39,865
you'd be in lockdown

463
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:41,900
in the deepest, darkest hole
in gitmo by now?

464
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:44,251
Sweetie, I could've paid
for that hotel room

465
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,086
with your credit card.

466
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,021
I could've spread your D.N.A.
all over that place.

467
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:48,456
I could've killed you,
made it look like

468
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,075
you shot the President
and then yourself. But I didn't.

469
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:53,494
I was supposed to, but I didn't.

470
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:54,629
How come?

471
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:55,780
Because I like you, Huck.

472
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:57,899
- You shot the President.
- So?

473
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:01,068
- Becky... - You were in B613.
You killed three world leaders.

474
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:02,370
Made 'em look like
heart attacks,

475
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:03,804
but still, three.

476
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,223
I shoot one a few times,

477
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:07,491
and you're suddenly
better than me?

478
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:09,659
What, I thought you were in A.A.

479
00:21:09,694 --> 00:21:11,178
because you like
to collect chips?

480
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:12,496
You like to kill people.

481
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,981
It's what you do.
It's who you are.

482
00:21:15,016 --> 00:21:17,701
Look, you're mad right now
because I had you,

483
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,469
because you let your guard down,
and I fooled you.

484
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:22,255
But, Huck,
you're missing the point.

485
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,474
We're alike.
You're like me.

486
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:26,343
We're the same.

487
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:29,229
We're built for each other.

488
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:31,764
So you can sit here every night

489
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,268
and watch your little family
eat their sandwiches,

490
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:37,803
or you can come with me.

491
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,971
Come with me.

492
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:40,222
I'm leaving town.

493
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,424
We could go on the run,

494
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,343
do the whole
Bonnie-and-Clyde-for-hire thing.

495
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:45,294
Just you and me.

496
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:47,312
Think about it, Huck.

497
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:52,651
(Kisses)

498
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:54,736
You know where to find me.

499
00:21:57,257 --> 00:21:59,308
(Car door opens)

500
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,661
(Car door closes)

501
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:03,796
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

502
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,997
(Doorbell rings)

503
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:11,569
'94 Du Bellay Chateauneuf du Pape.

504
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:13,354
Wow.
What's the occasion?

505
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:15,573
My husband is
cheating on me.

506
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:23,982
What did he say?

507
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:25,617
I'm not asking him.

508
00:22:25,651 --> 00:22:28,620
He's lying to me about
visiting his parents.

509
00:22:28,654 --> 00:22:29,954
He loves you.

510
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:32,173
He's much younger than me
and very handsome

511
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:33,608
and a bit of a slut.

512
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:35,326
(Laughs) Cyrus.

513
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,361
Before he met me,
he was a bit of a slut,

514
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:39,980
which I found very sexy,
and I shouldn't have,

515
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:42,833
because now my young,
handsome, slutty husband

516
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,769
is cheating on me, and I am
going to grow old alone.

517
00:22:44,803 --> 00:22:47,571
You don't know for sure
he's cheating.

518
00:22:48,206 --> 00:22:49,806
(Chuckles)
I will know for sure

519
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,842
as soon as my private
investigator gets back to me.

520
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:53,360
You hired a P.I. on him?

521
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:55,212
Wouldn't you?

522
00:22:55,246 --> 00:22:56,513
Yeah.

523
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:59,833
I am going to grow old alone.

524
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,922
I'm making lists...

525
00:23:04,923 --> 00:23:07,491
of Fitz's favorite songs,

526
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:09,542
bands he loves,

527
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:10,793
poems he's quoted,

528
00:23:10,827 --> 00:23:13,596
Bible verses that seem to fit
his personality,

529
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,714
hymns he likes.

530
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:17,233
Sally has me
planning his funeral.

531
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:19,819
Mellie's let me visit him
exactly once,

532
00:23:19,853 --> 00:23:22,538
then she revoked
my privileges.

533
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:25,308
I may not even
get to say good-bye.

534
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:31,247
I'm gonna say this once,

535
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:34,433
and I better not ever
have to say it again...

536
00:23:36,002 --> 00:23:37,486
Don't you ever again
suggest to me

537
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,472
that Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III
is going to die.

538
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:43,508
That is unacceptable
coming from you.

539
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,460
He calls you the love of his life.

540
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:50,599
Don't you <i>dare</i> give up on him.

541
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:56,455
(Whispers) Yeah.

542
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:02,878
W...

543
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:05,379
Do you wanna watch the news?

544
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:06,380
Yes.

545
00:24:06,398 --> 00:24:07,348
Mm-hmm.

546
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:08,566
Sure.

547
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:12,954
<i>(Man speaking indistinctly)</i>

548
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:18,659
You are not going
to grow old alone.

549
00:24:18,694 --> 00:24:19,844
You're never alone.

550
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:21,395
I'm here.

551
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:28,502
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

552
00:24:29,037 --> 00:24:30,237
It's blackmail.

553
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:32,639
That Bible-thumping bitch
is blackmailing me,

554
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:35,275
and I don't want to give in to her.
I won't.

555
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,227
But I have every intention of
living long enough to resign

556
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:39,696
when there's a legitimate
President in office.

557
00:24:39,731 --> 00:24:42,266
- Fitz is a legitimate President.
- You know what I mean.

558
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,867
- I'm talking about...
- He's lying in a hospital room,

559
00:24:43,902 --> 00:24:46,369
fighting for his life, and he had
nothing to do with how he got elected.

560
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,071
He's a patriot
and he's legitimate.

561
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,759
We're both in hospital rooms.

562
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:55,863
(Sighs)
Karma's a funny thing.

563
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:58,831
We're paying the price
for what we did.

564
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:03,970
Liv, is there any way
out of this with Sally?

565
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:06,355
Anything I can do to keep
her from blackmailing me?

566
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:08,707
You can resign.
Step down from the bench.

567
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,876
- Liv... - It's the only way if you
want to keep your legacy intact.

568
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:12,328
You spend the time you have left

569
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,013
with your family, your grandkids.

570
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:15,881
Oh, that sounds nice.

571
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,620
I've been seeing pictures

572
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,690
of that fellow wearing
the red hoodie all day.

573
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:27,743
He looks a lot like Huck.

574
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:28,844
Huh.

575
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:34,917
Like I said,

576
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,568
karma's a funny thing.

577
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,590

(Keys jangle and thud)

580
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,755

(Sighs)

582
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,509
I'll leave with you.

583
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,194
Really?

584
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,929
Yeah, we're the same.

585
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:40,881
We're built the same.

586
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:42,498
I love you.

587
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:44,417
I love you, too.

588
00:26:45,636 --> 00:26:47,120
What's your real name?

589
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:49,105
Does it matter?

590
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:55,945
No, it doesn't.

591
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,551
Just give me an hour
to get my stuff.

592
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:04,602
- I'll meet you at our spot?
- Okay.

593
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,716
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

594
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:37,103
Just tell me.

595
00:27:37,254 --> 00:27:39,588
Don't sugarcoat it. How long
has it been? Is it serious?

596
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:41,273
Did you take pictures?

597
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:44,760
I looked into it. Your husband's
not seeing anyone on the side.

598
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:46,578
(Exhales)
Oh, thank God.

599
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:48,814
The number on your phone belongs
to a guy named David Rrosen.

600
00:27:48,848 --> 00:27:49,948
David Rosen?

601
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:52,384
He's an assistant
U.S. attorney,

602
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:53,802
who, by the way, is straight.

603
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:56,404
Just got dumped by some redhead.
He's taking it really hard.

604
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:58,640
Anyway, he's been calling James
for some kind of information,

605
00:27:58,674 --> 00:28:00,625
and as far as I can tell, James
hasn't given him anything.

606
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:03,778
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but I'm an artist.

607
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:05,313
I'm an innovator in my field.

608
00:28:05,331 --> 00:28:06,981
The retainer you're
paying me is generous,

609
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:08,533
but maybe don't call me up
every time your husband

610
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:11,136
takes a business trip to some
tiny little town in Ohio.

611
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:13,905
What town...

612
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:14,972
in Ohio?

613
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:16,757
Which tiny little town
did he visit?

614
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:18,242
Defiance, near Toledo.

615
00:28:18,277 --> 00:28:21,412
And he charged it to his expense
account... work, not personal.

616
00:28:21,746 --> 00:28:23,013
(Exhales deeply)

617
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,698
Keep watching him.

618
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:26,467
I'll pay you
whatever you want.

619
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:29,236
(Tires peal)

620
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,638
I tracked down the woman
from the hotel elevator.

621
00:28:31,673 --> 00:28:32,723
That's good news.

622
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:33,874
Unfortunately,
so did the FBI.

623
00:28:33,908 --> 00:28:35,559
They got her
and the phone he picked up.

624
00:28:35,593 --> 00:28:37,694
- We were too late. I'm sorry.
- So not-so-good news.

625
00:28:37,745 --> 00:28:39,529
(Cell phone beeps)

626
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,331
(Rings and beeps)

627
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,350
Huck, where are you?

628
00:28:43,384 --> 00:28:46,353
(Indistinct conversations)

629
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,193
Are you insane?
Go back to the office.

630
00:28:53,227 --> 00:28:55,228
It's not safe for you here.
I promised I'd say good-bye.

631
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:56,347
What are you talking about?

632
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,980
I was in the hotel room.
People saw me.

633
00:28:57,981 --> 00:28:59,082
I don't care.
You didn't do it.

634
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:00,066
Doesn't matter.
People saw me.

635
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:02,719
If they want to hang me
for this, they will.

636
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:05,738
What?
She got to you, didn't she?

637
00:29:05,772 --> 00:29:07,006
No.
She did.

638
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,841
You found her,
and she got to you.

639
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,760
Huck, she shot the President.

640
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:12,327
Not just that,
she shot the President,

641
00:29:12,362 --> 00:29:13,846
and she framed <i>you</i> for it.

642
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,130
She was doing her job.

643
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:19,068
Her job? Huck, this isn't
just about you anymore.

644
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:21,070
It's about a man
lying in a hospital bed

645
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:23,489
because your girlfriend
shot him in the head,

646
00:29:23,523 --> 00:29:25,591
a woman who's clearly using
you to protect herself.

647
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,960
And if you can't see that,
you're blind. Huck...

648
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:29,645
Don't touch me.

649
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:33,015
Do I tell you who to love?
No.

650
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:35,234
So don't tell me.

651
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,339
(Indistinct conversations continue)

652
00:29:41,941 --> 00:29:45,527
Up Independence Avenue,
swinging back on Pennsylvania.

653
00:29:46,178 --> 00:29:47,612
Ms. Pope.

654
00:29:48,146 --> 00:29:49,413
We're just discussing
possible routes

655
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:50,447
for the funeral procession.

656
00:29:50,465 --> 00:29:51,816
We're operating
on the assumption

657
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,235
that the body would lie in state
in the Capitol rotunda.

658
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:56,387
Tradition calls for 24 hours
for public visitation.

659
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:59,123
- Yes, of course. - Then there is
the question of open casket or closed.

660
00:29:59,157 --> 00:30:00,975
I'll take that question
to the first lady.

661
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:03,144
As far as military presence
and protocol at the site,

662
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:06,430
if you'll turn to page seven,

663
00:30:06,465 --> 00:30:09,684
you'll see we've arranged
a 21-gun salute,

664
00:30:09,718 --> 00:30:12,203
as well as six honor guards
to fold the casket's flag

665
00:30:12,237 --> 00:30:14,322
before presenting it
to the first lady.

666
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:16,157
(Volume fades)
We've also confirmed

667
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,442
a missing man aerial flyover
by the U.S. air force.

668
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,295
(Speaking inaudibly)

669
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:27,834
Have you thought about putting
the casket outdoors?

670
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:32,839
He loves being outdoors.

671
00:30:59,832 --> 00:31:01,449
Becky's meeting me in an hour.

672
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:02,934
As soon as she leaves
her apartment,

673
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:05,036
wait ten minutes, then go
in, and plant the gun.

674
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,338
Copy that.
Huck?

675
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:08,456
- Yes?
- You're doing the right thing.

676
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:10,875
Don't go in before
the ten minutes are up.

677
00:31:10,926 --> 00:31:11,877
Half the time people think

678
00:31:11,928 --> 00:31:14,529
they've forgotten
something and come back.

679
00:31:14,563 --> 00:31:16,281
(Beep)

680
00:31:19,418 --> 00:31:23,004
(Projector and camera

681
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:26,373
(Door closes)

682
00:31:26,391 --> 00:31:27,075
I'm home.

683
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,510
Cyrus?

684
00:31:32,748 --> 00:31:35,350
What are you...

685
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:37,801
Did you cook all this?

686
00:31:37,836 --> 00:31:39,470
I ordered it
from a restaurant.

687
00:31:39,504 --> 00:31:40,804
Well,
you set the table and...

688
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:43,107
Amalia set the table.
She's off today,

689
00:31:43,141 --> 00:31:44,825
but I made her come in
and set the table,

690
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,260
which is... I'm a republican
overlord, I know, but...

691
00:31:46,294 --> 00:31:47,261
Cyrus Beene.

692
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:49,647
<i>But</i> there's a reason.

693
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:50,614
Mm.

694
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:52,465
What did you do?

695
00:31:52,783 --> 00:31:55,001
A baby was born
at County General this evening

696
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:56,553
at 5:42 P.M. ...

697
00:31:56,604 --> 00:31:58,872
A girl.
5 pounds, 11 ounces.

698
00:31:58,906 --> 00:32:01,007
We can bring her home
in a week, if...

699
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,842
You say yes.

700
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:04,410
- You stole a baby?
- I did not...

701
00:32:04,445 --> 00:32:06,012
- You <i>bought</i> a baby?
- I pulled some strings

702
00:32:06,046 --> 00:32:07,580
and got us
to the front of the line,

703
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:10,049
which is wrong, very wrong.

704
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:12,118
But like I said,
I'm a republican overlord,

705
00:32:12,152 --> 00:32:14,570
and your dream is a baby,
so...

706
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:15,721
(Chuckles)

707
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:18,741
And now you're thinking
"why now?"

708
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:22,695
When I didn't want a baby
before, why now?

709
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:24,196
Someone sh...

710
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:25,899
Shot my best friend.

711
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:31,320
He's lying in a hospital bed
dying, which makes me denying us

712
00:32:31,354 --> 00:32:34,056
a chance to start a family
seem ludicrous.

713
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,341
So there's a baby girl
in county general,

714
00:32:36,376 --> 00:32:39,627
and if you say yes, in one week,
she could be our daughter.

715
00:32:39,678 --> 00:32:40,729
- We can...
- Yes.

716
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:42,881
You know I'll go back to work soon.

717
00:32:42,915 --> 00:32:44,099
Yes. This is our baby.

718
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,650
Which means

719
00:32:46,068 --> 00:32:47,969
- you'll need to stay home.
- Yes.

720
00:32:48,003 --> 00:32:50,538
You'll have to quit your job

721
00:32:50,572 --> 00:32:52,256
because one parent
should be at home.

722
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:54,558
I'm not gonna stop
saying yes.

723
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,160
Hey.

724
00:32:57,345 --> 00:32:58,562
Yes?

725
00:32:59,764 --> 00:33:01,348
Yes.

726
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:06,520
Yes. Yes.

727
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:08,055
Yes. (Kisses)

728
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:10,791
Okay. Come here.

729
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,112

President Grant's funeral plans,
pending the first lady's approval.

787
00:36:34,296 --> 00:36:35,647
Hmm.

788
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:37,915
Why a riderless horse during
the funeral procession?

789
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,836
It symbolizes a warrior
who rides no more.

790
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,255
And the boots reversed
in the stirrups?

791
00:36:44,273 --> 00:36:46,441
They represent a fallen leader
looking back on his troops

792
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:48,192
for the last time.

793
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:49,894
Nice job.

794
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:51,546
Hopefully,
we won't have to use it.

795
00:36:53,331 --> 00:36:55,283
By the way, did the FBI
manage to get

796
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:57,684
a print off that woman's cell phone?

797
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:00,421
They did.
But it was only a partial,

798
00:37:00,455 --> 00:37:03,123
which is as good as nothing
without a suspect in custody.

799
00:37:03,158 --> 00:37:04,241
Anything else?

800
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:06,160
No. Good night,
madam President.

801
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:08,045
Good night.

802
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:11,381
Olivia.

803
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:12,783
So you finally got

804
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:14,384
a President that'll do
your bidding.

805
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:15,685
Didn't your mama ever
teach you to share?

806
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,587
We're supposed to be in this together.
We had a deal.

807
00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:20,423
Am I the pot or this kettle
in this here dealio?

808
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:23,526
You took down Verna.

809
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,045
You drew first blood.
You and Verna turned on me

810
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,048
when you conspired to save
Lindsay Dwyer behind my back.

811
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:30,516
I believe everything
that comes after now,

812
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,186
well, that's just what they
call... (Whispers) fair game.

813
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:37,839
Your boy really went crazy tonight.

814
00:37:37,874 --> 00:37:39,958
He stopped by two baby stores.
At the first place,

815
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:41,460
he made the clerk explain
how to put in a car seat.

816
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:42,844
It was... thrilling.

817
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:43,746
Where is he now?

818
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,680
Probably still at the baby store.
You want me to go back?

819
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,285
That's okay.
You can stop watching him.

820
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,106
At least for now.

821
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,676
The slow nipples work
for most newborns.

822
00:37:58,127 --> 00:37:59,744
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- A girl.

823
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:01,229
- Congratulations.
-Thanks.

824
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:02,964
If you have any questions,
I'll be right around the corner.

825
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:04,666
Thank you.

826
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,751
Okay. Where were we?

827
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,103
Something about the national
election being rigged,

828
00:38:09,138 --> 00:38:11,022
which you say you can prove.

829
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,124
Yes, what I can't prove is who
on the Grant team knew about it.

830
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:14,375
Does your husband know
you're looking into this?

831
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:15,693
He offered me a baby.

832
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:16,761
He hates babies.

833
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:19,279
- So he knows.
- He'll be watching you.

834
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,498
Which is why
I need you to take this.

835
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,949
And this is?

836
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,819
The memory card I stole from
the voting machine in defiance.

837
00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:26,954
Lose it and we bungle

838
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:28,488
the biggest story
since Watergate.

839
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,890
Keep it...

840
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:32,743
And we bring down an entire
administration together.

841
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:33,961
I need to go.

842
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:35,095
Yeah.

843
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,547
See you.

844
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,900

845
00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:52,937

(Unzips zipper)

849
00:39:52,397 --> 00:39:53,948
(Panting)

850
00:40:12,317 --> 00:40:15,202
(Panting)

851
00:40:31,408 --> 00:40:33,459
(Door closes)

852
00:40:35,278 --> 00:40:36,929
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

853
00:40:38,315 --> 00:40:40,699
Madam President, supreme court
justice Verna Thornton

854
00:40:40,734 --> 00:40:42,401
is here to see you.

855
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:47,907
- You're looking well.
- Yes, I am.

856
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:49,875
Are you here to deliver
your letter of resignation?

857
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:51,810
- I do have it, however...
- However?

858
00:40:51,845 --> 00:40:54,813
However, I would like to offer
you something else instead.

859
00:40:54,848 --> 00:40:55,898
I'm not sure there is
anything I want from you,

860
00:40:55,932 --> 00:40:57,616
other than your seat
on the bench, so...

861
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,752
Not even the name of the
man in the red hoodie?

862
00:41:05,942 --> 00:41:08,694
I could give you my
letter of resignation

863
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:11,079
or I could give you the name

864
00:41:11,113 --> 00:41:13,114
of the man who tried
to kill the President.

865
00:41:13,149 --> 00:41:14,749
The most wanted man
in the world,

866
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:16,384
your Osama Bin Laden.

867
00:41:16,418 --> 00:41:18,019
One pill makes you larger.

868
00:41:18,037 --> 00:41:19,721
One pill makes you small.

869
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:28,162
You need to come here.
Huck needs you.

870
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:30,264
He keeps saying that
she killed his family.

871
00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:31,565
Do you know what that means?

872
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,985
What family?

873
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:37,588
Huck, you need to
listen to me right now.

874
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:40,324
She will not get away with this.
We will find her.

875
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:43,594
We will find her.

876
00:41:45,497 --> 00:41:48,265
I don't know why we're not
telling the FBI about Becky.

877
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,134
Won't do any good.
She's in the wind.

878
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:51,568
So? They could mobilize

879
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:52,736
thousands of agents
to look for her.

880
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,321
They could get the whole
country looking for her.

881
00:41:54,355 --> 00:41:55,589
It took the whole country
two years to find you,

882
00:41:55,623 --> 00:41:57,207
and you weren't even a superspy.

883
00:41:57,242 --> 00:41:58,842
Also, if they start
looking into Becky,

884
00:41:58,893 --> 00:41:59,977
they'll eventually find
a Huck connection.

885
00:42:00,011 --> 00:42:01,695
The FBI only has a partial print.

886
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:03,780
As long as they can't match
it to him, he's safe.

887
00:42:03,832 --> 00:42:05,532
I can't watch this.

888
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:10,704
(Gasps)

889
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,757
Shh.

890
00:42:19,013 --> 00:42:20,781
Where is he?

891
00:42:23,317 --> 00:42:26,069
(Thud) (Man) Get on the floor!
Get on the floor now!

892
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,520
(Olivia) What are you...

893
00:42:27,538 --> 00:42:29,489
(Man speaking indistinctly)

894
00:42:30,123 --> 00:42:31,390
(Man) Do not move!

895
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:32,675
(Handcuffs click)

896
00:42:34,712 --> 00:42:36,530
What's the charge?

897
00:42:37,248 --> 00:42:38,982
This man is being held under
the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act.

898
00:42:45,906 --> 00:42:47,123
(Projector and camera shutter clicks)

899
00:42:47,142 --> 00:42:50,584
