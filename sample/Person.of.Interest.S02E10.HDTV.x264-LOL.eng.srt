1
00:00:01,665 --> 00:00:03,883
You are being watched.

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:06,686
The government
has a secret system--

3
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:10,706
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

4
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,292
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

5
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:15,043
but it sees everything...

6
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:18,264
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

7
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:20,933
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

8
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:23,552
We don't.

9
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:28,190
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

10
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:30,392
You will never find us.

11
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:32,227
But victim or perpetrator,

12
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,603
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

14
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:40,236
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.

15
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,373
If you're watching this,
you'll know I'm in trouble.

16
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:50,212
I've always tried to
be good, keep the rules.

17
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:53,432
Now I'm gonna break them
in a big way.

18
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:13,486
Just hold him still.

19
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:16,271
Bear, <i>afliggen!</i>
Sit.

20
00:01:16,273 --> 00:01:18,273
Well, that was a big help.

21
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:19,441
So, you said we had
another number?

22
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:22,277
Yes.
Abby Monroe, 26.

23
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:24,713
Honor student at school,
degree in engineering.

24
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:27,115
She's worked for the last year
at a military charity,

25
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:29,451
Homes For Our Returning Heroes,

26
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:31,420
maybe because
her younger brother

27
00:01:31,422 --> 00:01:35,891
was killed in Afghanistan
18 months ago.

28
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:38,894
She quit the charity
a week ago.

29
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:42,348
She's now working as a temp
in a city planning office.

30
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,766
Any threats?

31
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:46,268
Not that I can see,
but some anomalies.

32
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,154
She dumped her phone
five days ago

33
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:49,805
and moved out of her apartment.

34
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:51,273
In fact, the only way
I could trace her

35
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:53,492
was through the temp agency.

36
00:01:53,494 --> 00:01:55,694
She's hiding from someone.

37
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:57,479
I'd better get eyes on her.

38
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:59,698
It's your turn to dry him.

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,951
She could be in
imminent danger, Finch.

40
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:03,536
Mr. Reese,
he's your dog.

41
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:06,922
You'll manage.

42
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:17,299
- Detective.
- Detective.

43
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:22,438
Dinner was fun.
What about doing it again?

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,674
I'm free tonight,
as it happens.

45
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:29,361
Sorry.
Got a case I'm looking at.

46
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:33,032
Him, actually.
Davidson.

47
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:34,884
The Internal Affairs cop
went missing last winter.

48
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:36,202
Did you know him?

49
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:38,854
Know him?
I had some run-ins with him.

50
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:39,872
What's your interest?

51
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:42,458
I got a tip, anonymous.

52
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,660
Said a cop killed him.

53
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:46,328
Whoa.

54
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,248
Well, maybe he was mixed up
in some HR business.

55
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,300
Maybe an HR cop took him out.

56
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:55,137
I heard of one group out of
the 51st was offing dealers

57
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,371
and selling their supply.

58
00:02:56,373 --> 00:02:58,173
You got any names?

59
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:02,094
Most of them are behind bars
or dead, but not all of them.

60
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:03,679
Will you excuse us?

61
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:07,733
Detective Carter,
we need to talk.

62
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:10,986
I'll catch up with you later.

63
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:13,856
So, with HR degraded
to the point of irrelevance,

64
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:16,775
my team is shifting priorities
back to the man in the suit.

65
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:19,061
He's still out there.
Do you still want to catch him?

66
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:21,780
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

67
00:03:21,782 --> 00:03:25,233
We have some new information,

68
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:27,119
including who he's working for.

69
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:29,371
Now, the bureau has been
tracking the emergence

70
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:30,956
of private intelligence
networks,

71
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,909
like the CIA or MI6,
but for profit.

72
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,629
We think the biggest of these
has Chinese backing.

73
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:39,465
They've got technology,
serious resources,

74
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:41,267
and they've been
buying up talent.

75
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,085
For instance,
we think Mark Snow,

76
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:44,753
the CIA agent
who contacted you,

77
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:46,055
may also have been recruited,

78
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:48,307
possibly by the man
in the suit.

79
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:51,310
- Really? Snow?
- Makes sense.

80
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:53,562
I mean, Snow was sent to
find this man by the CIA.

81
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:56,148
He catches him, and then
the man in the suit flips him.

82
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,266
Gets snow to be his asset.

83
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:00,602
Listen, Carter, I want to
read you into this,

84
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:02,154
but it's classified,

85
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:03,706
so I've been authorized
to offer you

86
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,607
a temporary assignment
to the bureau.

87
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:07,960
And I know, with your skills,

88
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:09,945
it'll soon become permanent.

89
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:12,614
Sooner you're on board,
sooner I can fill you in.

90
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:14,216
So, please, think about it.

91
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:16,502
I will.
Thank you.

92
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:22,725
Thanks.

93
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:26,011
Carter.

94
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,096
Hello, Detective.

95
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:28,897
I need to find our friend.

96
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,632
We have a big problem.

97
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:34,019
You'll find him at the
department of city planning.

98
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:51,170
So he just downloaded
the file and walked out?

99
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:53,422
Yeah.

100
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:55,040
Didn't anyone try to stop her?

101
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:56,925
Apparently nobody noticed.

102
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,628
Detective Carter.
Uh, what do we got?

103
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,780
- You heard the 10-31 too,
Detective?

104
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:04,049
Yep.
So, what is it?

105
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:05,968
Uh, like we were telling
Marshal Jennings here--

106
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,520
Marshal Jennings, huh?

107
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:10,338
The manager called it in
'cause one of his staff,

108
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,007
a girl by the name
of Abby Monroe,

109
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:13,675
downloaded a file illegally.

110
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:15,444
And walked out with it
two hours ago.

111
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:16,979
No one noticed till too late.

112
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:18,697
Well, does anyone know
what's on the file?

113
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:20,949
Well, we keep plans here
for some important buildings,

114
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,152
but all she walked out with
were some engineering drawings

115
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:25,704
for the 1400 block of Hanover
near Wall Street.

116
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:27,456
It's got
an electrical sub-station,

117
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,525
lawyers' offices, and the HQ
of an investment bank.

118
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:32,828
Nothing like a critical
infrastructure target.

119
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,030
So, does anyone know where
this Abby Monroe lives?

120
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:36,415
We ran a check.

121
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,217
The address she gave us
is fake.

122
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:39,718
The phone number
is a pay phone.

123
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,255
Hey,
solid background check there.

124
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:44,506
What can I say?

125
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:46,208
I mean, she seemed like
a sweet kid.

126
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,376
Kind of disappointing to find
she was a flake.

127
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:52,398
Kids. You never know.
Right, Detective?

128
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,732
Right.

129
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:56,819
Anyway, good job,
following up so quickly.

130
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:58,386
Gentlemen.

131
00:05:58,388 --> 00:05:59,888
Thank you, Marshal.

132
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,608
Uh, look, if you come up
with anything else,

133
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,194
give me a call.

134
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:06,895
John. John!

135
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:08,230
Are you out of your mind?

136
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:10,565
Impersonating
a law enforcement officer?

137
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,252
Marshal Jennings?
You took his star?

138
00:06:13,254 --> 00:06:15,070
He wasn't using it anymore.

139
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:16,622
It's great, Carter.

140
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:18,123
Just flash a badge,
and people tell you everything.

141
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,908
You gotta stop, John.

142
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,845
Donnelly's back, and he's hot
for the man in the suit.

143
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:24,579
He has a new theory.

144
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:26,432
Yeah, that I'm working
for China or something.

145
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:27,966
We heard.

146
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:30,519
We also heard his offer.

147
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:34,606
Maybe a transfer to the FBI
would be good for you.

148
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:37,359
Do you listen to
all of my conversations?

149
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:38,644
More or less.

150
00:06:38,646 --> 00:06:40,279
You're looking nice, Carter.

151
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,064
Maybe this Cal Beecher
would be good for you too.

152
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:43,699
Long as he treats you right.

153
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,284
He messes with you,
he'll be hearing from me.

154
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:46,752
Okay. All right, look.

155
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:49,154
We're gonna have to set
some boundaries here.

156
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:50,322
Well, sure.

157
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:51,773
Things get heavy
with you and Cal,

158
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:53,775
we'll tune out right away.

159
00:06:53,777 --> 00:06:55,377
Never mind.

160
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:57,779
Um, what's the deal
with Abby Monroe?

161
00:06:57,781 --> 00:06:59,631
I was checking to see
she wasn't in trouble.

162
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:01,083
Looks like I'm a bit late.

163
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:03,385
Carter, can you get me footage
from that camera

164
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:04,720
from about two hours ago?

165
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:06,722
And that camera too?

166
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:09,675
Thank you.

167
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:14,396
There's Abby.

168
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,267
Were you able to trace

169
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,651
the owner of the motorcycle,
Detective?

170
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:21,286
No, because it was stolen

171
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:24,156
from a second-hand showroom
in Queens four days ago.

172
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:26,608
I got the camera tapes
out of the robbery squad.

173
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,477
I see the perp
is a single male.

174
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,163
You looking at the footage now?

175
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:32,197
Yes. Why?

176
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,166
No reason.

177
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:36,502
Blew the locks with det cord.

178
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:38,120
Ignored the alarms,

179
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:41,757
'cause he knew he'd be
less than 30 seconds.

180
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,827
He broke the key case
with his bare hand.

181
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:48,830
Chose his machine.

182
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:51,600
Whoa.

183
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:56,338
That's impressive.

184
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,441
What is-- what--
what is going on here?

185
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:02,694
Don't tell me you can see
what's on my computer too.

186
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:06,231
What did I say
about setting boundaries?

187
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,206
That's a prosthetic hand.

188
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,741
High-end prosthetic,

189
00:08:15,743 --> 00:08:18,544
use of det cord to gain entry
into a building.

190
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:21,029
My guess, ex-military.

191
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:22,714
Might explain
his connection to Abby.

192
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:24,499
The question is,
what are they doing?

193
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:26,501
I don't think you're
gonna like the answer.

194
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:29,254
Comp stat just flagged
my license plate inquiry.

195
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:30,672
The same motorcycle was seen

196
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:32,724
on a traffic light camera
near a robbery

197
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:35,210
at a construction site
in New Jersey three nights ago.

198
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:36,345
What was stolen?

199
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:39,064
Explosives.
Semtex.

200
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:41,483
20 pounds of it,
and blasting caps.

201
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:43,485
Let's see, theft of explosives,

202
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:46,822
theft of engineering plans
for a block on Wall Street.

203
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:49,024
This guy could be
the next Timothy McVeigh,

204
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:50,692
and your girl
is working with him.

205
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:53,111
He may have manipulated her
into getting involved.

206
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:54,580
She's still involved.

207
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:58,951
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to do my job.

208
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:02,371
I'm gonna have to put
her name out on an APB.

209
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:08,510
We've got to find her first.

210
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:23,935
Hey, Olson,
you worked at the 55.

211
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:26,287
You know a Narco detective
named Cal Beecher?

212
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:27,522
Oh, yeah, sure do.

213
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:29,090
We used to call him
18-karat Cal.

214
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:30,525
Better suits, better cars,

215
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:31,759
better girls
than the rest of us.

216
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:33,378
Maybe he just had better taste.

217
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,896
Or maybe he was on the take.

218
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:36,314
Did you hear me say that?

219
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,816
Don't know.
What are you saying?

220
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:40,185
Look, he was
undercover narcotics.

221
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:42,770
A lot of buy-and-busts,
a lot of money hanging around.

222
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,989
Anyway, why you want to know?

223
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:46,741
Ah, I just been
seeing him around.

224
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:48,660
Yeah. He's been hanging around
Detective Carter.

225
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:50,829
Bees like honey, Fusco.

226
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:52,997
Yeah.

227
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:57,952
I'm just saying, but the way

228
00:09:57,954 --> 00:10:00,071
Abby went off the grid,
cut all ties,

229
00:10:00,073 --> 00:10:02,090
she's planning something,
Finch.

230
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:04,459
You think our honor student
wants to blow up Wall Street?

231
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:06,127
Well, her boyfriend might.

232
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:08,346
He isn't the first vet
to try something extreme.

233
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,849
We are an odd bunch, Finch.

234
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:13,852
You are odd, Mr. Reese.
You're also wrong.

235
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:16,521
If Abby were involved
with domestic terrorism,

236
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:18,940
which would be
a relevant crime,

237
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:20,441
the machine would have
given her number

238
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:23,144
to-- to whoever
now runs that end of things

239
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:25,280
at the government, not to us.

240
00:10:25,282 --> 00:10:29,033
Whether she's the target
or the source of the threat,

241
00:10:29,035 --> 00:10:30,568
the issues must be personal.

242
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,937
Fine, but what leads
do we have left, Finch?

243
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:34,656
We have two.

244
00:10:34,658 --> 00:10:36,991
First, the pay phone number
that she gave the temp agency.

245
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:39,494
It's a street corner in Queens.

246
00:10:39,496 --> 00:10:40,945
The agency must have been able

247
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,580
to contact her there
at one point.

248
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:44,415
It might give you a clue
as to where she's living.

249
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:47,385
Okay.
And the second lead?

250
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:49,170
The one stable point
in her life for the last year--

251
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:51,573
The charity,
Homes For Our Returning Heroes.

252
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:52,807
I'll check that one out.

253
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,643
Good.
You need to get out more.

254
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:57,461
You're in a good mood,
Mr. Reese.

255
00:10:57,463 --> 00:10:58,629
I am.

256
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:00,014
I woke up this morning
and felt--

257
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,299
it took me a while to put
my finger on it,

258
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:02,517
but I felt happy.

259
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,686
Must be this job.

260
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:07,572
Well, I'm glad.

261
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:09,440
Sorry, Bear.
Not now.

262
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:30,962
Abby tapped into
that pay phone.

263
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:32,497
I think I've found

264
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:35,016
where our Bonnie and Clyde
have been laying low.

265
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:19,143
Josh Monroe,
Abby's little brother.

266
00:12:28,103 --> 00:12:30,888
I'm an old friend
of Abby's family,

267
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,573
and as I was visiting New York,

268
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,442
they asked if I'd try to
find out where Abby is

269
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:36,377
and why she left her job here.

270
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,196
She never told them?

271
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,448
Well, I'm sorry,
but I had to fire her.

272
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,118
- Fire her? What on earth for?
- Stealing.

273
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,421
At first, it was just
petty cash, and I let it go,

274
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:49,540
thinking it was simple
carelessness, but then I found

275
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,626
she was sneaking
into the charity's accounts,

276
00:12:51,628 --> 00:12:55,380
trying to move money around--
significant amounts.

277
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,465
Mr. Chapple,

278
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:00,134
that really doesn't sound
like the Abby I know.

279
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:02,086
Well, unfortunately, it's true.

280
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:05,523
We give low-cost loans to
veterans in financial trouble.

281
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:07,058
Any hint of a scandal,

282
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,893
and our donations would
just dry right up.

283
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:11,863
Abby had to go.

284
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:14,682
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.

285
00:13:14,684 --> 00:13:17,952
If you're watching this,
you'll know I'm in trouble.

286
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:23,307
I don't think you've really been
mad at me since I was eight,

287
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:26,044
that time I tied Josh
to his skateboard

288
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:28,012
and pushed him down the hill
in front of our house

289
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:31,549
to see how fast he would go.

290
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:36,387
Since then, I've always tried to
be good, keep the rules.

291
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:39,540
Now I'm gonna break them
in a big way.

292
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:44,846
Why? Well, it's complicated
and it's simple.

293
00:13:44,848 --> 00:13:46,848
I'm doing it because
it's right,

294
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,986
and I know Josh
would agree with me.

295
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:54,405
He was my little brother,
but I always looked up to him,

296
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:59,694
and I know
that he would be proud of me,

297
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:04,799
just like I hope you are
when you know the truth.

298
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:10,154
I love you, and I hope
you never have to see this.

299
00:14:10,156 --> 00:14:14,125
Any idea
why she started stealing?

300
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:17,762
I believe the trouble started
when she met a former Marine.

301
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:20,681
Uh, they'd talk
when he came by the offices.

302
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:24,185
Somehow, he must have made
an impression on Abby,

303
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:27,688
'cause, just about that time,
she started stealing.

304
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,141
I don't understand.
Why did this Marine come here?

305
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,526
I'm sorry.

306
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:33,144
We have a strict
confidentiality agreement

307
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:34,612
with all
of our loan recipients.

308
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:38,449
Suffice it to say,
it was not a pleasant visit.

309
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:41,018
Could you at least
tell me his name?

310
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:44,071
Corporal Shayn Coleman,

311
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:46,624
explosives ordinance
disposal expert.

312
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:48,042
Lost his right arm

313
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:50,912
defusing an IED in Afghanistan
three years ago.

314
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,880
He's our motorcycle thief.

315
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:55,833
I tracked down Shayn's parents
in his hometown in Ohio.

316
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:59,053
They haven't seen him
in more than two months.

317
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:00,638
Did they know
he was in trouble?

318
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,307
They said he'd had
his home foreclosed on,

319
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:05,042
and his fiancee dumped him.

320
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:07,011
Must be why
he went to Chapple--

321
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:08,729
to ask for another loan.

322
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:11,048
However it happened,
this is more than enough

323
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,683
to tip someone over the edge.

324
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:15,987
He's our guy.
I'm adding his name to the APB.

325
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:18,689
Do what you have to do,
Detective.

326
00:15:20,944 --> 00:15:23,027
Finch, are you still there?

327
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,596
Yes.

328
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:29,534
I'm watching Philip Chapple
meet with two armed men.

329
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:31,235
What are they like?

330
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:34,589
Like you, to be honest--
low-key and vaguely menacing.

331
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:36,574
I suspect he's telling them
to follow me

332
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:38,009
via the GPS transponder

333
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:40,461
he slipped into my pocket
as I was leaving.

334
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:42,547
And where is
the transponder now?

335
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:45,299
It's on a laundry van
with Jersey plates.

336
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:46,934
Nice work, Finch.

337
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:49,387
Obviously, Chapple
will take any opportunity

338
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,355
to track Abby down.

339
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:54,058
What she's planning
must connect to him too.

340
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,693
When the charity closes,
I'll go back in,

341
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:57,195
see what I can find.

342
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:58,529
When I said
you need to get out more,

343
00:15:58,531 --> 00:15:59,697
I didn't mean that.

344
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,115
Let me take care of it.

345
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:03,534
No such thing as
a risk-free life, Mr. Reese,

346
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:05,369
and Abby is still our priority.

347
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:06,904
You wait for her.

348
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:08,155
So, I'll go back in,

349
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:10,358
see what exactly
Chapple's hiding.

350
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:23,087
I'm inside,

351
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:27,425
but the alarm
has been tampered with.

352
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:30,127
That's because they could be
waiting for you, Harold.

353
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,395
Ah!

354
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:34,932
What was that?
Finch, get out now.

355
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,467
Who the hell are you?

356
00:16:36,469 --> 00:16:38,603
Who I am is not important,
Mr. Coleman.

357
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:41,072
How do you know my name?
What are you doing here?

358
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:42,640
The same thing as you,
I expect,

359
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:44,275
and since you woke
the whole building,

360
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:46,444
we better hurry.

361
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:49,363
I'm on my way to you.

362
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:53,584
Please, just walk away now,
Finch.

363
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:55,253
Shh!

364
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:56,787
- Who are you?
- It's okay.

365
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:59,657
- Let go of me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

366
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:13,054
Finch, get out now.

367
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:14,171
Don't risk it.
I've got Abby.

368
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:15,222
Just get out of there.

369
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:17,024
Nearly done, Mr. Reese.

370
00:17:18,843 --> 00:17:20,394
Please don't do that.

371
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:23,814
Then get off of me.
Let me go.

372
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:41,165
Please, no guns.

373
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:52,259
Finch, talk to me.
What's happening?

374
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:55,563
The situation
is evolving, Mr. Reese.

375
00:17:57,516 --> 00:17:58,882
There they go!

376
00:17:58,884 --> 00:18:01,852
Stop right there!

377
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,325
Get on, or they'll kill you!

378
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:09,193
Get on!

379
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:17,668
Finch, are you okay?

380
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,954
Aside from riding on a
motorcycle illegally, I'm fine!

381
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:22,123
I'll be in touch!

382
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,342
Well done.

383
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:28,462
Hello, Abby.

384
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:30,598
I'm John.

385
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:46,511
Okay, you should leave now,

386
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:49,414
because my boyfriend's
gonna be here any minute.

387
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,716
Your boyfriend, Shayn?

388
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:54,185
I don't know how
you know that, but yes,

389
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:57,238
and he's a Marine,
so you do not want to meet him.

390
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,990
Actually,
I do want to meet him,

391
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:00,575
but first things first.

392
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:02,326
What does that message
to your mom and dad mean?

393
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:03,828
What?

394
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,663
You broke into my room
and went through my stuff?

395
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:08,416
Get out, or I'm--

396
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:11,085
What?
You'll call the police?

397
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:14,205
I know about the building plans
and the explosives.

398
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:17,125
I knew it.
You work for Chapple.

399
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:19,961
No, but I'm interested
to know why you and Shayn

400
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:21,745
are going after him.

401
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:24,715
Because Chapple's a liar
and a thief,

402
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:26,717
and I'm not saying another word

403
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:29,554
until you tell me who you are.

404
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:33,191
I'm here to stop you from
getting into even more trouble.

405
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:35,109
Not what I asked.

406
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:38,729
Who are you?

407
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:40,448
I find it hard to answer that,

408
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:45,102
even to myself.

409
00:19:45,104 --> 00:19:48,906
I was a soldier once,
like your brother Josh.

410
00:19:48,908 --> 00:19:53,461
But I was lucky.
I made it out.

411
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:55,797
- Mr, Reese?
- Yes, Finch. What's happening?

412
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,533
I've explained to Shayn
that we're trying to help him.

413
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:00,117
Did he believe you?

414
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,171
No, especially when I told him
that you have Abby.

415
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:05,773
Things are a little tense.

416
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:08,759
Let me talk to him.

417
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:14,816
Who is this?

418
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:17,235
You know, Abby keeps
asking me the same thing.

419
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:19,103
It's really not important.

420
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:21,138
If you hurt her,
you will be sorry.

421
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,409
The same goes for you
and my friend.

422
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:28,746
We should meet.

423
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:35,586
Once you leave with Shayn,
I can't protect you anymore.

424
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:38,089
I never asked you to
protect me in the first place.

425
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:40,658
Whatever you're planning,
I know why, Abby.

426
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,126
You couldn't save your brother,

427
00:20:42,128 --> 00:20:45,763
so you're trying to save Shayn.

428
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:48,933
I understand that, truly.

429
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:51,335
I'd feel the same way.

430
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:54,305
Tell me,
what did Chapple do to you?

431
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:58,192
Nothing I can't handle,
but he nearly destroyed Shayn.

432
00:20:58,194 --> 00:21:00,278
- By lending him money?
- Yes.

433
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,029
Chapple made him a loan.

434
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:04,232
The interest rates
tripled in a year.

435
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:06,517
No one could keep up
those payments.

436
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,352
Millions of people
lost their homes.

437
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:11,405
They don't go around
stealing explosives.

438
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:12,657
Shayn should move on.

439
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:15,493
He lost his home
and his fiancee.

440
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:18,162
He even introduced some of
his buddies to Chapple,

441
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:20,047
one of whom shot himself

442
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:22,366
on the porch of the house
he no longer owned.

443
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,418
Should he move on from that?

444
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,971
Look, I went through
Chapple's files.

445
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:28,389
I saw what he was doing.

446
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:29,840
There are hundreds,

447
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:33,010
hundreds of soldiers
who lost their homes.

448
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:47,408
What are you gonna do, Abby?

449
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,893
The right thing.

450
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:52,580
Can I go now?

451
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:04,208
I assume you
put a tracker on him.

452
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,245
Rather a clever one,
if I do say so myself.

453
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:11,749
His prosthetic arm is controlled
by myoelectric sensors

454
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:13,935
by way of a wireless link,

455
00:22:13,937 --> 00:22:18,189
so I cloned the link
and reprogrammed it

456
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:21,692
to attempt a forced pair with
every cell phone they pass.

457
00:22:21,694 --> 00:22:24,862
Leaving a nice GPS trail.

458
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:26,480
Well done, Finch.

459
00:22:26,482 --> 00:22:28,733
Especially on the back
of a speeding motorcycle,

460
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:31,702
which was exhilarating,
by the way.

461
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:35,406
I might have to get myself one.

462
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,481
Working late?

463
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:47,117
Uh, yeah. Um...

464
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,720
It's always something,
you know?

465
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:54,458
Yeah.
Is something wrong, Carter?

466
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,794
Donnelly made me
an offer today.

467
00:22:56,796 --> 00:22:59,647
What, I got competition?
From that guy?

468
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:01,131
No, not that sort of offer.

469
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:06,237
He, um, invited me
to join the FBI.

470
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:08,739
Could be a good move.

471
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:11,242
I mean, yeah,
small fish in a big pond,

472
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:13,577
but think of the prospects,
Carter, and the money.

473
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:14,996
You should do it.

474
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:16,998
But what about my kid?

475
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,483
I mean,
it-- it'll probably mean

476
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:21,952
I have to move out of New York.

477
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:23,654
You mean I'd never
see you again?

478
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:30,544
It's Cal.

479
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:35,049
No problem.
I'll see you then.

480
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:38,886
Uh, now what were we
talking about?

481
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:41,138
About never seeing me again.

482
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,642
Right.

483
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:46,360
It's Cal.

484
00:23:46,362 --> 00:23:48,846
Cal, Alonzo Quinn.
Can we meet?

485
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:50,948
Tyrell Park.
Say, 30 minutes?

486
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,451
No problem.

487
00:23:57,873 --> 00:23:59,990
I'm hoping you can
help me out, Cal.

488
00:23:59,992 --> 00:24:01,692
Any way I can,
Mr. Quinn.

489
00:24:01,694 --> 00:24:06,580
The Mayor has seen this
crime spike in Crown Heights--

490
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:09,667
drug busts, uh, burglaries,
even homicides.

491
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:11,419
He wants me to find out
what's happening.

492
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:14,088
I told him I got a godson
who's got his ear to the ground.

493
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,723
So, do you?

494
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:18,542
Crown Heights, yeah.

495
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:20,210
We think it's a Russian,
Peter Yogorov.

496
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:23,481
Used to work Brighton Beach
till Elias kicked him out.

497
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:26,067
We believe he's pulling strings
from the inside,

498
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:28,436
working to take over
the Heights.

499
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:32,239
Boo.

500
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:34,024
What are you doing here,
Simmons?

501
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:36,610
I'm keeping an eye on you,
you slippery little mutt.

502
00:24:36,612 --> 00:24:38,162
What are you doing?

503
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:41,165
None of your business.

504
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:43,117
You're following Cal Beecher.

505
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,952
You're checking him out
for Carter?

506
00:24:44,954 --> 00:24:47,671
No, I've been wondering

507
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:50,174
who else you've been
flapping your gums to.

508
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,910
About you burying Davidson?

509
00:24:52,912 --> 00:24:56,079
Not Beecher.
Not yet.

510
00:24:56,081 --> 00:24:58,632
You crossed a line when you
made that call to Carter,

511
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:00,634
pointing her towards me
in the Davidson murder.

512
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:02,553
What line is that?

513
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:05,306
The line where I don't
give a crap anymore.

514
00:25:05,308 --> 00:25:09,259
So watch your back.

515
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:12,696
You know how many times
I've heard that?

516
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:18,068
And here I am,
beautiful as ever.

517
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,871
Go home, Fusco.

518
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:32,333
What are you doing here,
Simmons?

519
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:34,835
I said, go home.

520
00:25:39,391 --> 00:25:41,091
There's our cell phone trail.

521
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,560
It looks like Abby and Shayn

522
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:44,311
are heading
for the 1400 block of Hanover.

523
00:25:44,313 --> 00:25:45,946
Question is, what's there?

524
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:48,449
I've listed every
business name on the block,

525
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:52,436
cross-checking against the
download of Chapple's computer.

526
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:56,340
Bingo. An investment bank,
Merton Watts.

527
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:57,942
Maybe he has an account there.

528
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:02,329
Not according
to his computer records.

529
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:04,665
- Then a safe deposit box?
- What would he keep in it?

530
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,984
According to his accounts,
Chapple's not rich.

531
00:26:06,986 --> 00:26:08,485
Abby said hundreds
of the loans he made

532
00:26:08,487 --> 00:26:09,870
were foreclosed on.

533
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:11,589
If he's getting kickbacks
from the banks--

534
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:12,656
You may be right.

535
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,208
Merton Watts has first lien

536
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,844
on any properties
Chapple loans money on.

537
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:19,180
That means they handle
all foreclosure sales.

538
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:20,848
And split the profits
with Chapple,

539
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,634
which he keeps in his
safe deposit box at the bank.

540
00:26:23,636 --> 00:26:26,003
That's what Abby and Shayn
are after.

541
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,639
Why is she doing this?
For Shayn?

542
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:30,941
Yes.
And for her brother.

543
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:32,977
She still feels a debt.

544
00:26:32,979 --> 00:26:37,615
The dead have a power
like that, as you know.

545
00:26:37,617 --> 00:26:39,683
So, how are they
going to do this?

546
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,652
Semtex and building plans.

547
00:26:41,654 --> 00:26:44,321
They'll find a soft entry point

548
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:47,190
and blast their way
into the vault.

549
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:49,293
I like these kids.

550
00:26:49,295 --> 00:26:51,011
I'd like them to live.

551
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:54,748
Please try to get to them
before Chapple's thugs do.

552
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,969
System's back up.

553
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:00,304
They get anything
from the safe?

554
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:03,007
The box code and the keys.

555
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:04,475
But there's no way they can
get into the vault

556
00:27:04,477 --> 00:27:05,693
at the bank, is there?

557
00:27:05,695 --> 00:27:07,061
What do you think?

558
00:27:07,063 --> 00:27:08,646
Police band says
they stole explosives

559
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:09,897
and engineering plans.

560
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:12,516
Well, get down there.
Deal with them.

561
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:14,935
You have to pay
for another man.

562
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:16,403
It's a big area to cover.

563
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:20,107
Whatever you need.
Just finish it.

564
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,468
Carter, I need to see you
immediately.

565
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,842
Can I have your phone?

566
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:44,811
What's going on, Donnelly?

567
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:48,148
I'm sorry, but I think the
organization our man works for

568
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,451
has some sophisticated
capabilities.

569
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:54,454
Like wire-tapping cops?

570
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:55,772
Has something happened?

571
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,107
I think we got our break.

572
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,611
The man in the suit was involved
in a robbery at a charity

573
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,913
on the Upper East Side.

574
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,280
How do you know that?

575
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,182
Now, before I can let you in,
I have to know

576
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,785
if you'll accept the temporary
assignment to the bureau.

577
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,922
Okay, yes.

578
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:15,091
Good.
You won't regret it.

579
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:18,845
So, we've been tracking
this man for ten months.

580
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:20,096
Every time we get close,

581
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,765
he slips right out
from under us,

582
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,483
as if he has
some guardian angel.

583
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:28,104
All I've looked for since then
is a lead, any lead,

584
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:31,024
and then I realized, the phone.

585
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:33,827
He's in constant communication
with his handlers.

586
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:35,362
I thought of that.

587
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:36,780
Cross-checked crime scenes
he was reported at

588
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,748
with cell tower logs of IMEIs.

589
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,284
- Came up with nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.

590
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,204
Our engineers at Quantico
analyzed the cell tower traffic

591
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:45,989
from that night he gave us
the slip downtown.

592
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,358
Under the wireless
and radio noise,

593
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,494
they found short bursts
of a cloned IMEI

594
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,964
with a unique signature.

595
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,433
I tasked an FBI computer cluster
to search for that signature.

596
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,668
24 hours ago,
the cluster came online.

597
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,705
It spotted another burst
of cloned imeis

598
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:03,773
at the exact time
and location of the robbery.

599
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,174
It's him.

600
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,176
I've got SWAT teams
standing by.

601
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,729
If he uses that phone,
we'll have him.

602
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,087
Abby, this is far enough.

603
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:35,722
I'll handle this from here.

604
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:37,206
I'll meet you back
at the apartment.

605
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,426
No.
No, together or nothing.

606
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:41,177
You've risked enough, Abby.

607
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,146
This isn't your fight
right now.

608
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:46,382
This is my fight.
You're my fight.

609
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,440
I wouldn't do that.

610
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:28,858
Or that.

611
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,278
Now, the truth...

612
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,982
or I take you
to the cops myself.

613
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:38,068
I know you're here
to steal Chapple's money.

614
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,153
What then?

615
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:42,872
We want to give it back to
the people he stole it from.

616
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,158
How?

617
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,079
We haven't thought
that far ahead.

618
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,064
You haven't thought
very far at all.

619
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:52,749
Now, why not go to the cops
or a lawyer?

620
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:54,317
Abby did.

621
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,619
She went to the DA,
but Chapple got there first,

622
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,971
spread his poison.

623
00:30:57,973 --> 00:30:59,806
The DA even threatened
to prosecute her

624
00:30:59,808 --> 00:31:01,057
for theft and slander.

625
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,642
When I got to my apartment,

626
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:04,260
one of Chapple's mercenaries
was there.

627
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,845
He beat me up.

628
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,931
He said if I said another word,

629
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:13,403
he would come back
and put a bullet in my head.

630
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:16,489
I assume the bank's
through there?

631
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:18,658
We blow that wall,
we're underneath it.

632
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,493
John, this has gone far enough.

633
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:21,811
Has it, Finch?

634
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,813
Yes. Stop them.
I can deal with Chapple.

635
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,398
Chapple hurt them, Finch.

636
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,951
They tried the law.
The law wasn't interested.

637
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,452
What have they got left?

638
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,505
Besides, I've always
had a thing

639
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:34,674
about people who screw
with veterans.

640
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:35,825
John, it's far too risky.

641
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,177
What did you say, Harold?

642
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:41,297
No such thing
as a risk-free life.

643
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,498
Let's do it.

644
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,968
Wait for the subway.

645
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,606
Now.

646
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:08,074
This is where
the safe deposit boxes are.

647
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:09,292
We realized
we couldn't get to them

648
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,577
from inside the bank,

649
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:12,745
so we decided
to bring them to us.

650
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:15,865
You're gonna blow the roof.

651
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:26,009
We got something here.

652
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:29,062
John, what's your situation?

653
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:30,930
Ten more minutes.

654
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:33,549
I'm seeing
what I can only describe

655
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,319
as interference
on our phone link.

656
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,887
Is it Root?

657
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,657
No, it's
a broad spectrum sweep,

658
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,242
heavy-duty computer power.

659
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:43,493
Root's more subtle than that.

660
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,061
It must be our FBI friend.

661
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,330
Stay off the line
and please get out now.

662
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,733
If Shayn and Abby won't come,
leave them.

663
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,202
I don't leave people,

664
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:54,504
and they're bringing down
a very bad man.

665
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,006
Now, isn't that what
your experiment's all about?

666
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,925
My experiment
is about stopping people

667
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:01,044
from getting killed,
not robbing banks.

668
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,579
Five minutes and we're out.

669
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:18,561
In three, two, one.

670
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,402
Let's go.

671
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:37,280
There, 158.

672
00:33:59,436 --> 00:34:01,521
His account's in a bank
in Venezuela.

673
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:03,273
- Is this what you need?
- Is it ever.

674
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,941
There's more than
$30 million here.

675
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:07,694
His charity stole $30 million.

676
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:09,779
Then let's go,
back the way we came.

677
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,365
Get down!

678
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:20,290
- You okay?
- Karma at last.

679
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,175
It's those thugs
Chapple hired, isn't it?

680
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:23,693
The bank opens in 30 minutes.

681
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,511
We've got to get out
before then.

682
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:28,381
Hang tight.

683
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:33,436
911 call.

684
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,638
Possible underground explosion
near Wall Street.

685
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,191
We're tracking IMEI bursts
in the same area. It's him.

686
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:39,642
Now, we hook up a
SWAT en route.

687
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,194
- Are you with us?
- Uh, yeah, of course.

688
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:42,445
I just need to make
a phone call.

689
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,180
All right, make it quick.

690
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,736
Hi, mom, can you make sure
Taylor gets to school?

691
00:34:49,738 --> 00:34:51,738
Mom?
You been drinking, Carter?

692
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,990
Tell Harold, Donnelly is
headed to Wall Street.

693
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:55,958
He says John is there.
He's tracking the phones.

694
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,361
Okay, mom. Yes.
Thank you. I love you.

695
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,302
Hey, it's Fusco.

696
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,137
Wherever wonderboy is, I hope
it's not near Wall Street,

697
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,472
because that's where
Donnelly's heading.

698
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:10,923
That's exactly where John is.

699
00:35:10,925 --> 00:35:13,009
Merton Watts Investment Bank,
Hanover Street.

700
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,260
Yeah, plus Carter
said something

701
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:15,311
about him being up
on your phones.

702
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,779
Just as I feared.

703
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,648
Anything you can do
to run interference for us

704
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,268
at the bank, Detective,
I would be most grateful.

705
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:50,571
I take it
you know this gentleman?

706
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:54,157
Peter Yogorov, enforcer
for the Russian mob.

707
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,010
Least he used to be until
Elias took out his old man.

708
00:35:57,012 --> 00:35:59,746
Seems like something
that might be to our advantage.

709
00:35:59,748 --> 00:36:02,282
To hit back at Elias?

710
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:05,002
To build
another revenue stream.

711
00:36:05,004 --> 00:36:06,470
Yogorov's at MCC,

712
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:08,472
awaiting trial
with his little brother Lazlo.

713
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:11,675
DA's got him dead to rights
on a dozen different counts.

714
00:36:11,677 --> 00:36:14,761
Maybe we can do something
about that.

715
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:17,347
You need something
on the District Attorney?

716
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,816
Let me handle that.

717
00:36:19,818 --> 00:36:21,985
By going all spartan
on our emissaries,

718
00:36:21,987 --> 00:36:26,607
Elias has made it clear--
that relationship is over.

719
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:29,225
We need new friends.

720
00:36:29,227 --> 00:36:32,562
You want me to talk
to the Russians?

721
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:34,397
Open negotiations?

722
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:36,333
They have all the right pieces,

723
00:36:36,335 --> 00:36:37,618
but with us behind them,

724
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,569
cash flow would no longer
be an issue.

725
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:41,505
Understood, boss.

726
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:44,240
Just heard something
interesting.

727
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:46,710
Looks like
that pain-in-the-ass Donnelly

728
00:36:46,712 --> 00:36:49,329
finally caught up
with the man in the suit.

729
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:55,352
Not even 7:00 AM,
and already a perfect day.

730
00:36:57,388 --> 00:36:59,973
The bank's about to open, John.

731
00:36:59,975 --> 00:37:03,527
Where are you?

732
00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:09,149
Mr. Reese,
what's happening?

733
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:13,403
I hate to say this, Finch,

734
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:14,905
but we're in a bit
of a pickle here.

735
00:37:14,907 --> 00:37:16,289
Get upstairs to the foyer.

736
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,325
I have IDs and passes
for all of you.

737
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:21,611
Cover us.

738
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,588
What are you looking for?

739
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,056
Clothes.

740
00:37:33,058 --> 00:37:36,760
You need to get changed.

741
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:38,345
We're gonna dress up
like bankers.

742
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:40,597
We're gonna climb up there

743
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,482
and walk right out
the front door.

744
00:37:42,484 --> 00:37:43,517
Come on.

745
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,489
Base just picked up another
burst of comms from the target.

746
00:37:49,491 --> 00:37:51,474
- Same location?
- Yes, sir.

747
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:54,027
So, you can track him, but you
can't hear what he's saying?

748
00:37:54,029 --> 00:37:56,029
Do you know who
he's talking to?

749
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:58,314
Not yet.

750
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:07,507
Give me the gun.
You take Abby.

751
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:08,959
You've done enough.

752
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:11,795
I'm the one
who got us into this mess.

753
00:38:11,797 --> 00:38:14,598
We all got ourselves
into this mess.

754
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,100
We're all going to
get ourselves out.

755
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:20,804
Now, when you get up
to the foyer, look for Harold.

756
00:38:20,806 --> 00:38:23,006
I'll be right behind you.

757
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:26,176
Now.

758
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:01,895
Looks like nothing's
going on inside.

759
00:39:01,897 --> 00:39:04,014
No, the signal's still active,
and the 911 call

760
00:39:04,016 --> 00:39:05,932
said the explosion was
underground, remember?

761
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:08,602
He's in there.

762
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:10,070
All right, one team
in front with me,

763
00:39:10,072 --> 00:39:11,387
second team, around the back.

764
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:12,856
We move in 30.

765
00:39:12,858 --> 00:39:16,193
Excuse me, ma'am.

766
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:18,111
I'm a client here at the bank.

767
00:39:18,113 --> 00:39:20,563
I need to get into
the vault now.

768
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:30,006
Hello.
Here. Take these.

769
00:39:30,008 --> 00:39:33,210
My name is Harold Wren.
I own an insurance company.

770
00:39:33,212 --> 00:39:36,763
You are my associates.
We have an appointment here.

771
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:38,348
Where's John?

772
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,416
FBI!
Everybody back against the wall!

773
00:39:40,418 --> 00:39:42,219
- Stay where you are!
- Don't move!

774
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:44,554
- Hands up!
- See your hands!

775
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:45,722
Foyer's secure.

776
00:39:45,724 --> 00:39:47,057
Check every ID.
No one leaves.

777
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:48,525
Half your men here,
half with me.

778
00:39:48,527 --> 00:39:49,609
Yes, sir.
Let's go!

779
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:50,811
Hands where we can see them!

780
00:39:50,813 --> 00:39:52,229
You! Don't move!

781
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:54,281
- See your ID, please?
- John, can you hear me?

782
00:39:54,283 --> 00:39:55,649
Shayn and Abby are safe.

783
00:39:55,651 --> 00:39:58,935
FBI are in the bank.
Get out now.

784
00:40:04,493 --> 00:40:05,792
We got company.

785
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:08,378
Lose the weapons
and get the hell out.

786
00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:13,834
John, can you hear me?
You must get out now.

787
00:40:13,836 --> 00:40:15,285
Blew out the damn floor.

788
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,003
Alpha, this is Delta.
Vault level is secure.

789
00:40:17,005 --> 00:40:18,755
I'm not gonna make it, Harold.

790
00:40:18,757 --> 00:40:20,390
Sorry I screwed up.

791
00:40:20,392 --> 00:40:24,561
But I meant
what I said yesterday.

792
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:27,013
So, thanks, Harold.
It was fun.

793
00:40:27,015 --> 00:40:28,315
John?

794
00:40:33,155 --> 00:40:35,272
ID?

795
00:40:35,274 --> 00:40:37,657
Harold Wren,
Universal Heritage Insurance.

796
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:39,192
My associates.

797
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:40,193
Why are you in the bank?

798
00:40:40,195 --> 00:40:41,644
We have a meeting

799
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:43,613
with the vice president
of Corporate Strategy.

800
00:40:48,954 --> 00:40:51,588
ID.

801
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,290
Did you get what you wanted?

802
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:55,675
All the money Chapple stole.

803
00:40:55,677 --> 00:40:57,594
More than $30 million.

804
00:40:57,596 --> 00:41:00,931
Can you do anything
with the accounts?

805
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,704
Yes.

806
00:41:07,706 --> 00:41:10,473
I'll empty them,
deposit every last cent

807
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:13,393
into the accounts of reputable
military charities.

808
00:41:13,395 --> 00:41:16,980
Would that do?

809
00:41:16,982 --> 00:41:18,848
Then I have to
get you out of here

810
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,516
and out of this state.

811
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:25,872
As long as we're together.

812
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:27,958
Check the top level.

813
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,795
Check down back.

814
00:41:31,797 --> 00:41:34,697
Don't worry.
I got you covered.

815
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:36,416
