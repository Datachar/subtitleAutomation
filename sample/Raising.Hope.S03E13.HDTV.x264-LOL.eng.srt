1
00:00:02,104 --> 00:00:03,790
I'm not sure she's ready
for her first sleepover.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,811
Maybe I should cancel my bachelor party.

3
00:00:05,846 --> 00:00:08,014
No, then I'll feel guilty about
having my bachelorette party,

4
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:09,982
and I won't be able
to enjoy watching a...

5
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:11,017
very muscular

6
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:12,051
half-man, half-tripod

7
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:13,686
gyrate in my no-fly zone.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,654
Well, there is not
going to be any of <i>that</i>

9
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:17,323
happening at my party.

10
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:19,091
We're just gonna be
hanging out, playing Mad Libs,

11
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:21,690
see what it's like to play beer
pong sober-- never done that.

12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,010
And then, after a while, if we're still

13
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:24,445
going strong, maybe we'll check out

14
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:26,113
Jay Leno's take on the day's events.

15
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:28,115
Oh, come on.
Don't make me do this alone.

16
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,585
When we compare notes,
we should both feel shameful.

17
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,721
No, I mean...
the last time I went wild,

18
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:35,222
I knocked up a serial killer.

19
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:37,697
In fact, every time I've gotten
wild, I've made bad decisions.

20
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:39,460
In high school, I became a Goth freak

21
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:40,694
and I pierced my wang-doodle.

22
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:41,862
That explains the whistling noise

23
00:00:41,897 --> 00:00:43,164
when we were getting frisky
the other night.

24
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:44,765
You know, I thought somebody
put on the teakettle.

25
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,233
Nope.

26
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:49,470
I've got a tiny, whistling hole
in my wang-doodle.

27
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:00,114
What's that?

28
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:02,183
Uh, nothing. Just some...

29
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:05,319
boring girl stuff I bought
for the bachelorette party.

30
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:09,223
So boring you had to hide it
in the vegetable crisper?

31
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:13,093
Okay, fine.

32
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:15,095
It's a bag of penises.

33
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,165
Whose are they, and why do they
have to be kept crisp?

34
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,468
I went to the novelty store to
pick up some things for tonight,

35
00:01:20,502 --> 00:01:22,436
and I couldn't stop myself!

36
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:24,738
They had penis hats, glasses, socks.

37
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:26,106
But not all of it was dirty stuff.

38
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:27,608
They also had
these salt and pepper shakers

39
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:29,944
that were shaped like little mushrooms.

40
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:33,747
No. Wait.
I just realized something.

41
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:34,915
Ooh, I see

42
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,451
you got some
vagina-shaped pasta.

43
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:38,686
No, those are just shells.

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,753
I stopped by Howdy's.

45
00:01:40,956 --> 00:01:42,122
That is not fair.

46
00:01:42,157 --> 00:01:43,858
You're gonna have a crazy night
with the girls,

47
00:01:43,892 --> 00:01:45,359
and for my first bachelor party,

48
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:46,994
I don't know exactly
what's gonna happen,

49
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:48,329
but I've heard the words "mocktails"

50
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:50,464
and "jigsaw puzzles,"
so I don't have a good feeling.

51
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:52,700
You should be proud
that your son isn't a pervert.

52
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:55,035
I mean, we might have made
some mistakes here and there,

53
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,305
but we were obviously classy
parents who made a good example.

54
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,540
Ooh!

55
00:01:59,574 --> 00:02:01,175
My boner scones are ready.

56
00:02:02,076 --> 00:02:09,608
 

57
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:11,685
Okay. That's the last word.

58
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,454
So the story is,

59
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:15,389
"I was 'bored'

60
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:18,392
"in my 'bored' hat and went to my...

61
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:19,860
"'boring' room, where I saw

62
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:21,295
"a 'bored' that was eating my

63
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,863
giant 'this sucks.'"

64
00:02:22,898 --> 00:02:23,964
I don't think that even makes sense.

65
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:28,502
Oh, hi, Tyler.

66
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:29,977
Hey, I think you got the wrong house.

67
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:31,138
We didn't order any pizzas tonight.

68
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:32,473
I'm not here on pizza business.

69
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:33,741
I'm a videographer.

70
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:35,442
That's why I brought my assistants,

71
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:36,944
my son and his friend,

72
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:39,346
who was unfortunate enough
to be sleeping over tonight.

73
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:41,348
The pizzas are our dinner

74
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:43,150
since the gentleman who hired us

75
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:44,718
refused to provide food.

76
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:46,854
It's a job, man, not a buffet.

77
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,224
Frank, this doesn't need to be recorded.

78
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:52,126
You could say that about every single

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,228
Matthew McConaughey movie ever made,

80
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:57,631
but that didn't stop Hollywood,
and it won't stop us.

81
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:02,636
You're all going down.

82
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:04,905
Though I guess that is kind
of the point of the game.

83
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,674
Bitches, you don't stand a chance.

84
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,909
I have low self-esteem
and I'm hungry.

85
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:12,146
I haven't paid
a speeding ticket since 1962.

86
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,248
You're about to see why.

87
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:15,282
Okay. On the count of three.

88
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:16,283
One,

89
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:17,384
two...

90
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,920
Stripper time!

91
00:03:20,956 --> 00:03:23,023
Somebody order a pizza?

92
00:03:23,058 --> 00:03:24,892
Sabrina, we didn't order a...

93
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,396
...a stripper.

94
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:31,198
That's a real pizza guy.

95
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:32,366
Please don't judge.

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,735
I get free pizza
and I sit in a car all night.

97
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:41,608
Oh! Ah. I found
the corner piece.

98
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:43,605
This is a bachelor party.

99
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:45,075
I want to go in the bathroom
and find a tiger.

100
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:46,843
I want to get punched
in the face by Mike Tyson.

101
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:49,045
I want to wake up on the roof
of a Las Vegas hotel.

102
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,180
Like that movie <i>The Hangover.</i>

103
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:51,948
- Didn't see it.
- This is

104
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,150
a low-key night-- we're not
gonna have that kind of party.

105
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:55,485
You can turn off the camera.

106
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,054
Nothing crazy is gonna happen.

107
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:03,560
Are you open?

108
00:04:06,397 --> 00:04:07,864
Anyone there?

109
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:10,467
Are you open?

110
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,702
Hello?

111
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:15,705
It's an emergency.

112
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,142
I can't eat my oatmeal without raisins!

113
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,180
What the hell happened?

114
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,819
'Sup?

115
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:41,759
Oh, geez.

116
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,150
Oh, boy.

117
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,728
Oh, God.

118
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,142
Top of the mornin'.

119
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:06,010
Last night was wild.

120
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:08,746
I'm not sure who remembers what,
but don't worry,

121
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:11,315
Tyler and the kids
captured the whole thing.

122
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,585
They're editing it as we speak.

123
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,821
'Sup, drunk white people.

124
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:18,623
You can turn the cameras off.

125
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:20,458
Nothing crazy is gonna happen.

126
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:25,029
It's go time.

127
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:28,599
Jimmy! Jimmy!
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

128
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:30,134
What in tarnation?

129
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,571
Jimmy! Jimmy!
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

130
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:37,108
Say hello to the boys
of Theta Delta Sigma,

131
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:38,543
the hardest partying fraternity

132
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:40,945
Natesville Vocational School
has to offer.

133
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:43,347
I invited them to help

134
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:45,650
give you the best night of your life.

135
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:47,652
Frat guys? Kegs of beer?

136
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:50,054
And a free slice of pizza
from two generous young...

137
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,489
Ow. I'll eat chips.

138
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:53,424
But it's still gonna be a great night!

139
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,494
Frank, I said I didn't want a big party!

140
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:58,229
I heard your words,

141
00:05:58,263 --> 00:06:01,032
but as your BFF--
best friend Frank--

142
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,034
I also heard your thoughts.

143
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:04,402
Frank!

144
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:06,137
Stop this! Stop this!

145
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:18,149
Barney Hughes,

146
00:06:18,183 --> 00:06:20,184
requesting permission to re-pledge.
Uh,

147
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,319
re-pledge?
Well,

148
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:22,833
22 years ago I pledged your fraternity

149
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:24,288
when I was at Natesville State.

150
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:27,125
I made it all the way to when
I had to swallow the goldfish.

151
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:28,993
But... I chewed.

152
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:30,161
I chewed.

153
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:31,195
Gross, dude.

154
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,897
Animal cruelty isn't cool.

155
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:35,333
But if you want the honor
of calling yourself a T-Delt,

156
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:36,901
just run full-speed
into that tree.

157
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:48,179
Porno! Porno! Porno!

158
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:49,380
Whoa! Frank,

159
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,482
we can't watch porn
back here, all right?

160
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:52,683
Neighbors can see it.

161
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:54,519
Then they'll get ideas and come over.

162
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:55,753
With wine coolers.

163
00:06:55,788 --> 00:06:57,555
Remind me to tell you that story.

164
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:58,589
It's not porn.

165
00:06:58,624 --> 00:06:59,757
- Aw!
- Look,

166
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:01,459
it's no secret your fiancee and I

167
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:02,460
don't get along.

168
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:03,661
So I just want to make sure

169
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:05,530
you have a clear picture

170
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:08,566
of the woman
you're going to call your wife.

171
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:14,605
Deal-breaker!

172
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:20,611
Girls don't fart!
Girls don't fart!

173
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:22,246
You think that's

174
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,781
disgusting, check out

175
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:26,317
what she's gonna look like in 30 years.

176
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:32,256
For lack of a stronger vocabulary,

177
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,225
she looks like human diarrhea.

178
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,494
What can I say, Frank?

179
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:38,529
I'm in love.

180
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:43,701
All right, looks like
he still wants to do it.

181
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,269
On to phase two.

182
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:47,271
I was hoping you would change
your mind about this

183
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:49,073
stupid marriage if we caught Sabrina

184
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:50,468
cheating on you, but unfortunately,

185
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:52,243
<i>her party was pretty lame.</i>

186
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,482
Honey! He's home!

187
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,725
Are you okay?

188
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,895
Oh, my God, did that hurt!

189
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:16,434
Why does your stripper look like Brian,

190
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:19,203
the chubby kid I went
to high school with?

191
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:21,138
Hey. Jimmy Chance.

192
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:22,807
Long time.

193
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:24,475
Quit staring, Jimmy!

194
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,544
You're making this awkward!

195
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,014
Ah. Aw, keg's dead!

196
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,151
Wh-Where we gonna get beer
this time of night?

197
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:36,087
I have keys to a grocery store!

198
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,225
Old pledge! Old pledge!
Old pledge! Old pledge!

199
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,195
Old pledge! Old pledge!
Old pledge!

200
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:48,799
It's all for us!

201
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,835
Take it all!

202
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:55,973
Whoo!

203
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:19,997
Whoo-hoo!

204
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:21,465
Yeah!

205
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,900
<i>Everyone was having a good time,</i>

206
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:24,402
<i>but I had a job to do.</i>

207
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:26,404
Pull!

208
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:29,173
<i>Since none of my plans</i>
<i>to stop this wedding</i>

209
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:31,909
<i>were working,</i>
<i>I had to go to my last resort.</i>

210
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:33,911
Check this out.
Mmm.

211
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:36,113
My sister's old wedding dress.

212
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:37,782
We should have a fake wedding.

213
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:38,916
It'll be hilarious.

214
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:40,918
To the happy couple!

215
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:59,537
Frank, do you take Jimmy to be
your lawfully wedded partner?

216
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:01,772
I do.

217
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:03,374
And, Jimmy,

218
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:05,743
do you take Frank to be
your lawfully wedded partner?

219
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:07,411
I do.

220
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:09,246
I always imagined
this would happen in Vegas

221
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:11,315
in a little wedding chapel
while we're being chased

222
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,650
by this little Asian guy.

223
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:14,218
You mean like in <i>The Hangover?</i>

224
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:16,754
Has everyone seen this movie except me?

225
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:20,291
I now pronounce you husbands for life.

226
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:21,392
Whoo!

227
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:25,963
Married! Married!

228
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:27,798
Married! Married! Married!

229
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,753
And in case you're
wondering if it's legal,

230
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:32,436
here's our marriage license.

231
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:33,938
Hey, Jimmy.

232
00:10:33,972 --> 00:10:36,440
The egg delivery guy is here,
and I can't find Barney.

233
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:37,708
Can you sign for it?

234
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:39,744
Yeah.

235
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:44,915
We're gonna need a witness to
prove Jimmy signed for the eggs.

236
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,283
Yeah.

237
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,786
So... sorry, Sabrina.

238
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,222
You can't marry Jimmy anymore

239
00:10:51,256 --> 00:10:53,404
because he's already taken.

240
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:07,692
Open the damn door, you little freak!

241
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:11,568
Oh, the ex.

242
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:13,211
This is uncomfortable.

243
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:16,681
You listen to me.
Oh, my God.

244
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:20,189
I forgot.
You have this whole weird town

245
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:21,859
and all those creepy dolls.

246
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:24,349
They're not dolls, they're action figures.

247
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:25,568
You better fix this, Frank,

248
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,836
because you are not
messing up my wedding!

249
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,739
I'm sorry, but if I let you guys
get married,

250
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,542
it'll mess up the plans
I made for Jimmy and I.

251
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:37,346
I mapped out a whole
future for us. Look.

252
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,687
First, I thought
we could learn how to surf

253
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:47,523
and show off our ripped bods
to the chicks at the beach.

254
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,658
Then, with your artistic talent

255
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:52,161
and my love of frigid temperatures,

256
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:55,598
I thought we could become
professional ice sculptors.

257
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,234
Then, in the off-season,
figured we could go to Spain

258
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:00,736
and run with the bulls.

259
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:04,373
Just because Jimmy and I
are getting married

260
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,942
doesn't mean you guys can't
do all that cool stuff together.

261
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,877
Seriously?

262
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:10,879
Awesome.

263
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:13,115
I've got a lot of other ideas, too.

264
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,784
I'll be right back.

265
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,553
What are you doing?

266
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:18,954
I don't want to go surfing with Frank.

267
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,590
I'm afraid of sharks
and jellyfish and sea lions.

268
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,125
I don't think sea lions
are what you think they are.

269
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,260
They're the kings of the ocean, right?

270
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:25,527
No, not really.

271
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:27,529
Look, we are dealing
with a mental patient here.

272
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:30,199
We just have to tell him
exactly what he wants to hear,

273
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,700
and then he'll give you the divorce,

274
00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:33,202
and then we can go get married.

275
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,570
We are going to have

276
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:35,604
so much fun.

277
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,507
How familiar are you

278
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:42,411
with the game I just invented
called unicycle lacrosse?

279
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,647
Yeah.

280
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,283
Listen, I'm at a client's house.

281
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:49,318
I can't discuss this right now.

282
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,221
Well, I don't think you should
wear a bow tie to the meeting.

283
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:55,224
Sorry about that.

284
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:57,059
Trouble with another client.

285
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:59,495
Sorry I'm late.

286
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,597
I was having trouble with my lawyer.

287
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:02,598
Wait.

288
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:04,133
You're representing him, too?

289
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,770
Oh, I'm afraid that's
attorney-client privilege.

290
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:09,438
But since you're also my client,

291
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:12,107
I think I can say yes.

292
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:13,776
An unusual tactic.

293
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,577
I want to see where this goes.

294
00:13:15,612 --> 00:13:17,079
But be warned, counselor.

295
00:13:17,113 --> 00:13:18,947
You're on a short leash.

296
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,149
<i>Law and Order.</i>

297
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:21,150
Okay.

298
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:22,551
Before my client

299
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:24,286
signs these divorce papers,

300
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:27,189
he's requested that you sign
a postnuptial agreement.

301
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:31,493
Which my client has full right
to refuse to sign.

302
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:34,029
You'll sign, or we'll see you in court.

303
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,666
"I, Jimmy Chance,

304
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:40,002
"promise to build birdhouses
with Frank Marolla,

305
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:42,971
"go on a hot air balloon ride,

306
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:45,040
"do monthly mole check.

307
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,076
"If I should fail
to fulfill these duties,

308
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,178
"I hereby relinquish the rights
to my van

309
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:51,113
"and custody of my daughter,
what's-her-name,

310
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:52,948
"who will then "be raised by Frank

311
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:54,049
"and immediately renamed

312
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,718
She-Frank."

313
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,019
I'm not signing this.

314
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,021
Well, why not?

315
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:01,790
It's just all the things
you promised we'd do together.

316
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:04,526
Because I don't want
to do any of that stuff, Frank.

317
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:07,563
I just want to marry the girl
I love, and if you were

318
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,331
a real friend, you'd understand that.

319
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:10,632
Great point, Jimmy.

320
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,535
Frank, how could you let him
say that to you?

321
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,637
I knew this was a mistake.

322
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:18,140
Never should have agreed
to this stupid meeting.

323
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,679
This is far from over!

324
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:28,884
I think we're in pretty good shape.

325
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:30,219
This is crazy.

326
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:31,387
Right? I've
got to be able

327
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:32,888
to get a divorce without him.

328
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:35,891
You get him to sign it,
and it'll be quick and easy.

329
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:38,761
But if not, and his lawyer
gets wind of this,

330
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,763
which he just did,

331
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,031
then they can really drag this out.

332
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,700
Which I fully intend to do.

333
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:45,934
What if someone cuts Frank's brake lines

334
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,336
and he died in a fiery car crash?

335
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,504
I'm spit-balling here.

336
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:49,805
If anybody's got a better idea

337
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,673
how to kill Frank and get away with it,

338
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,841
the floor is yours.

339
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,009
Wait a minute.

340
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:55,411
If he wants to be married to Jimmy,

341
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:56,645
maybe we should see

342
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,847
if he <i>really</i> wants
to be married to Jimmy.

343
00:14:58,882 --> 00:15:00,349
That's a great idea.

344
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:03,018
Jimmy should pressure him
for sex constantly.

345
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:05,187
He'll enjoy it
for the first couple of months,

346
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,122
but eventually,
it'll just turn into a chore.

347
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,690
No, I'm not saying they should

348
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:10,259
conjugate the marriage, Burt.

349
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,860
I just think Frank should see

350
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:14,730
what it's really like spending
all his time with Jimmy.

351
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,600
Wally Phipps.

352
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:20,669
Oh. You were brilliant,

353
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:22,771
and that bow tie did look great.

354
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:27,943
Oh, those Chances don't
have a chance of winning.

355
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,211
Yeah.

356
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:32,748
I don't have a fancy pun for "Frank,"

357
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,550
but we're gonna destroy him.

358
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,618
Oh, wait.

359
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:38,320
I'm speaking to you <i>frankly.</i>

360
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,089
Nailed it.

361
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:48,056
All right, Frank thinks

362
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,434
spending all his time
with Jimmy would be great.

363
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,219
But what he doesn't know is what
a pain in the ass you are.

364
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:53,220
What are you talking about?

365
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:54,821
You've got some annoying habits.

366
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:56,990
Like when you sing in the shower.

367
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:00,160
♪ I've been working on the railroad ♪

368
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:02,996
♪ All the livelong day ♪

369
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,966
♪ I've been working
on the railroad ♪

370
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,001
♪ Just to pass the time... ♪

371
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:10,670
And when you're irritated,

372
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,272
you do a play-by-play
of your every move.

373
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,375
Oh, great, you ate
the last of the cookies.

374
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,944
Now I've got to pick up the plate,

375
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:21,081
walk back to the kitchen,

376
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:22,816
put the plate in the sink.

377
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:26,253
Pick up the broken pieces.

378
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:27,787
Ah, God!

379
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:29,890
Cut my finger.

380
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,958
Now I've got to look
for a Band-Aid.

381
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:34,060
And, of course,
there are none in the drawer.

382
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:36,429
But I found some cookies.

383
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:38,999
Walking back into the living room.

384
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:43,403
And I'm sitting back down.

385
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,972
Only to see you drank
the last of the milk.

386
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,541
Getting up again...

387
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:48,808
It drives me crazy

388
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:51,044
when you only drink half of every soda.

389
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,215
Jimmy!

390
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,584
Without the bubbles,
my tongue gets the flavor,

391
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:59,319
but my nose doesn't get the tickle.

392
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,154
Puts my whole face out of whack.

393
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,157
I mean, these are all just bad habits.

394
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,760
I mean, look, somebody could
have just said something.

395
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:08,061
That's annoying, too.

396
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,829
How you always make everything
our fault.

397
00:17:09,864 --> 00:17:10,830
Totally.

398
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,232
Oh, yeah.

399
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,901
All right, fine.
I'm annoying.

400
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:16,436
I'll just go and get Frank

401
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,905
to divorce me by being myself.

402
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,206
And I'm headed to the door.

403
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:21,675
I'm grabbing my jacket.

404
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:22,909
Ugh!

405
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:24,711
Looking for my shoes.
Ugh.

406
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:26,079
Looking...

407
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,547
<i>The first thing I had to do</i>

408
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:29,249
<i>was go to Frank's and make him believe</i>

409
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:30,784
<i>I was really moving in.</i>

410
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,452
- Jimmy?
- Okay.

411
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,755
Fine. You know what?! It's over!

412
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,892
Whoa. What
happened there?

413
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:41,161
What can I say, Frank? Bitches.

414
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:43,463
Does your offer still stand
to live here?

415
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,065
Are you kidding?

416
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,967
Our monogrammed towels
got here this morning.

417
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,102
Of course it still stands.

418
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,770
Make yourself at home, hubby.

419
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:53,506
<i>First, I tried
annoying him in the bathroom.</i>

420
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,543
♪ Someone's in the kitchen, I know ♪

421
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,145
♪ Someone's in the kitchen
with Dinah ♪

422
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,615
♪ Strummin' on the old banjo ♪

423
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:03,950
♪ Fee, fie, fiddly-i-ay ♪

424
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:06,653
♪ Fee, fie,
fiddly-i-o ♪

425
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:09,155
♪ Fee, fie, fiddly-i-ay ♪

426
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,591
♪ Strummin' on the old banjo. ♪

427
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,961
<i>Then I tried annoying
him in the kitchen.</i>

428
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:18,465
Awesome. I always said the
problem with soda is that

429
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:21,735
it's too bubbly, and there's
too much of it in each can.

430
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:25,071
<i>Some things I didn't
even get a chance to try.</i>

431
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:26,339
What are you doing in there?

432
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:27,907
I'm looking for a glass.

433
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,209
What about now?

434
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:31,411
Rinsing the glass out.

435
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:32,746
And now?

436
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,381
Still rinsing.

437
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:35,782
Gonna be a couple minutes.

438
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:37,684
You want some company?

439
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:40,820
<i>Turns out Frank was so happy
to have someone in his life,</i>

440
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:42,355
<i>he didn't care what I did.</i>

441
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,991
<i>And that actually made being</i>
<i>married to him kind of fun.</i>

442
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:47,027
Psst! Jimmy!

443
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,331
It's been three days.
What's the holdup?

444
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:53,033
Leave me alone.
All right, I'm working on it.

445
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,901
Work faster. We got sick
of explaining where you were,

446
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,603
so we told Hope you were mad at her.

447
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:57,937
The longer this goes on,

448
00:18:57,972 --> 00:18:59,472
the worse that decision looks.

449
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,508
Maybe it's time
to tell Frank to take a drive.

450
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,009
You know,

451
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:04,511
down a long road, by a steep cliff.

452
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:07,480
What? I'm just kidding.

453
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:09,482
What? I didn't cut
his brake lines.

454
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:11,885
Jimmy, your sardines are ready.

455
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,053
I'll be right there!

456
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,387
Busting out the big guns, huh?

457
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:16,189
I forgot how you like
to eat those stinky sardines.

458
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,357
He's gonna hate that.

459
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:18,858
Yeah, he does hate it,
but you know what?

460
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:19,859
He doesn't just secretly

461
00:19:19,894 --> 00:19:21,327
judge me for my annoying habits

462
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:22,395
like the rest of you.

463
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,497
He loves me for who I am.

464
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,066
There's no way he loves you, Jimmy.

465
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,467
You're going to wind up living

466
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,469
in a cage in the basement, I feel it.

467
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,204
Frank is a
wonderful person.

468
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,840
He doesn't yell at me for
leaving my towel on the floor,

469
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,408
or complain that I'm a horrible singer.

470
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:37,310
No. He harmonizes

471
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,778
and brings me on-key.

472
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:41,081
And if that isn't a metaphor,
I don't know what is.

473
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:42,949
I'm serious. I don't know
what a metaphor is.

474
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,984
Frank wouldn't judge me for that.

475
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:48,888
Jimmy,

476
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:52,092
I just wanted to say
that these last few days

477
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:54,861
have been better
than I could have ever imagined.

478
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:59,065
I've never really had
a relationship before,

479
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,067
and every moment with you

480
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:02,435
has been a revelation.

481
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,437
I know exactly how you feel.

482
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:06,806
I've never felt so
accepted for who I am.

483
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:08,942
Me, neither.
Mmm.

484
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:11,745
But here's the thing.

485
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:13,713
I think I might rather try it
with a girl.

486
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:14,748
A girl?

487
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:17,350
Yeah, you know, for the sex part.

488
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,919
So, you're breaking up with me?

489
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:21,354
Just like that?

490
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,890
But there's so much stuff
that I wanted us to do together.

491
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:25,558
Well, we can still be friends, Jimmy.

492
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:27,427
It's not like
we'll never see each other.

493
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:29,295
We'll always have Howdy's.

494
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:32,298
Let me drive you home.

495
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,101
Whoa! Frank, no!
Um, let's walk.

496
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:36,736
I mean, it's beautiful out.

497
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:40,273
Sabrina cut my brakes, didn't she?

498
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,407
Yeah, probably.

499
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:45,861
That's a damn fine woman
you got there, Jimmy.

500
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:47,551
Damn fine.

501
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:49,796
So, the next day,

502
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,420
<i>Frank and I called Wally</i>
<i>and got a divorce.</i>

503
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,407
<i>But not before</i>
<i>I added a post-nup</i>

504
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:56,393
<i>to make sure we'd always stay friends.</i>

505
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:01,448
I now pronounce you
ex-husband and ex-wife.

506
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,064
You may now kiss your fiancée.

507
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:09,525
When I finally find the one,

508
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:12,019
I hope you'll at least
consider swapping.

509
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:22,948
