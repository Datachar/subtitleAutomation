The government
has a secret system--

3
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:10,732
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

4
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:13,351
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

5
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,069
but it sees everything...

involving ordinary people.

7
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:20,975

these people irrelevant.

We don't.

Never paid a bill late,

of his credit score.

26
00:01:21,137 --> 00:01:22,470

from his savings account.

Could be in trouble.

29
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:28,109
Or he's about to get into some.

30
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:30,612
Considering that cab drivers
are 30 times more likely

31
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:33,114
to be killed on the job
than most other professions,

32
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:35,900

a close eye on him.

to step into his cab.

by his own passenger

182
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:41,131
800 for the laptop.

183
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,132
You don't trust me?

184
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:44,151
Not at all.

185
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:47,355
[Laughs nervously] Okay.

186
00:07:47,357 --> 00:07:49,407
Thank you.

187
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,493
- Thank you so much, man.
- Good luck, my friend.

188
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:03,671
Finch, I think
I know what happened

189
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:05,656
to our cabbie's savings.

190
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:09,994
He's carrying it all
around with him right now.

191
00:08:09,996 --> 00:08:11,712
We must have
overlooked something.

192
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:12,964
Does he have gambling debts?

193
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:16,217
Is he dealing drugs?

194
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:19,503
Whatever it is,
it's about to go down.

195
00:08:26,695 --> 00:08:28,863
Looks like he's about
to buy something,

196
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:31,148
or buy his way
out of a big hole.

197
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,787
Uh, Senor Mendoza.

198
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,539
Fermin.

199
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,557
_

200
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:44,806
_

201
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:51,702
Do they, uh...
have a safe way to get here?

202
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:56,674
This is the last photo I have
of my wife and son.

203
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:04,432
We have a slight problem,
Fermin.

204
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:06,484
The price has gone up.

205
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:08,602
What do you mean?

206
00:09:08,604 --> 00:09:10,938
I mean, you only have
enough money

207
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,723
for Maria or Jorge,
but not both.

208
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:13,941
No.

209
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:18,195
Senor Mendoza, don't do this.

210
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:20,748
You know it is not safe
for them in Cuba anymore.

211
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,917
Maria says that the neighbors
are getting curious.

212
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,952
They sense that she and Jorge
are leaving soon.

213
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:26,754
If an official finds out,

214
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:28,372
they will arrest her
on suspicion.

215
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:30,591
Fermin, we've known each other
for how long?

216
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:33,844
I helped you
when everybody stopped caring.

217
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:36,347
Put you back on your feet
after the surgery

218
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,299
when your career was over.

219
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:41,519
These are prices
I do not control.

220
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:44,355
But how am I supposed to come up
with another $40,000?

221
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:49,060
It's the land of opportunity,
my friend.

222
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:51,862
You'll find a way.

223
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:57,234
Ordoñez is a desperate man,
Finch.

224
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:59,703
Pushing around his cab
for the past five years,

225
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:02,606
saving up to bring his wife
and his kid here.

226
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:05,443
Sounds like
he just came up short.

227
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:07,878
Who knows
what he'd be willing to do

228
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,047
to get his family back?

229
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,657
I hacked
the Cuban Government database.

230
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,959
Surprisingly
sophisticated software.

231
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,495
No doubt,
courtesy of the Russians.

232
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,415
Don't tell me
Fidel Castro's really dead.

233
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,532
Actually, yes.

234
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,719
And his body double has cancer.

235
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,971
The Cubans keep a file
on every defector.

236
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,124
Apparently, Ordoñez pitched
for the Cuban national team

237
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,976
from 2000 to 2005,

238
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,095
when he defected to the US.

239
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:49,964
Wanted a better life
for his wife and child.

240
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:53,134
Cuba was a surveillance state
long before the advent

241
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:56,237
of security cameras
and digital networking.

242
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,073
If they catch his family
trying to defect,

243
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,491
his wife can go to prison.

244
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,409
Explains why Ordoñez is
so desperate

245
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,528
to get his family out of there.

246
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,780
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

247
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:08,649
Stay close, Mr. Reese.

248
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,090
Ordoñez turned off his sign.

249
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,657
He's not looking for a fare.

250
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:18,593
So who's he waiting for?

251
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,179
Acosta! Acosta!
Over here, man!

252
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,882
Look over here, Acosta!
Beautiful family!

253
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,684
Rafael Acosta.

254
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,553
Plays second base for New York.

255
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,138
Rafael Acosta?
Of course.

256
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,806
They defected together in '05.

257
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:34,142
Escaped from a hotel room
in the Netherlands

258
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:36,311
during an international
baseball tournament.

259
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:38,446
- Acosta--he's having
a pretty good year.

260
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,115
Career year, Mr. Reese.

261
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,633
He's top ten in OPS
among infielders

262
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,201
for the last three.

263
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,353
You're a baseball
reference machine, Finch.

264
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:46,404
You should get out more,

265
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,289
take in a game once in a while.

266
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,491
Who says I don't?

267
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:54,212
Hey, Raffi.

268
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,675
_

269
00:11:58,153 --> 00:11:59,688
_

270
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:03,172
_

271
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:05,205
_

272
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:06,343
Yeah.

273
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,009
How's the shoulder, man?

274
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:09,928
Uh, it's okay.

275
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,547
Look, man,
I-I hate to ask,

276
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:14,232
but, you see, I, uh--

277
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,484
I just need a little help
with <i>mi familia,</i> you know?

278
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,520
Oh, yeah, yeah.

279
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:20,071
Of course, uh...

280
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,656
How are they?

281
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,224
I don't really know, Raffi.

282
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:24,993
You know, I haven't--

283
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,444
I haven't seen them
in a long time.

284
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,164
I'm still trying
to get them out of there.

285
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,732
Here you are, man.

286
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,068
Just, uh, <i>toma.</i>

287
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,455
Take that.

288
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,207
Good luck, Fermie, okay?

289
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:43,077
Baby, let's go.

290
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:48,216
Acosta ended up with
the life Ordoñez could have had.

291
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:51,719
Now he just wants
his family back.

292
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,443
Detective,
the meeting with Elias' guys

293
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,894
is on for this morning.

294
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:03,398
- We'll come and pick you up.
- Count me out.

295
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,433
You got one too many skeletons
in the closet

296
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:07,068
to be calling the shots here.

297
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,437
Not to mention,
a couple buried in the ground.

298
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:11,873
But they can always be dug up.

299
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,209
Fine, I'll be there.

300
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,077
You don't need me for this.

301
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,545
You got youngblood recruit
right over there.

302
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,880
Have him twist
a few arms for you.

303
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,500
Elias knows how
to hold a grudge.

304
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,669
You're here because
if this thing goes sideways,

305
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,306
these guys are gonna want
something to shoot.

306
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,258
That's comforting.

307
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,796
Gotta say...

308
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,815
took some balls,
calling a meeting like this.

309
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,434
In the shape HR is in,

310
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:41,769
I'm not quite sure
what you have to offer anymore.

311
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,655
Just your goodwill.

312
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,573
Your boss wanted the heads
of the five families

313
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,908
on a stick.

314
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,662
Grifoni's the only one
that got away.

315
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,780
Last I checked,
he was in Witness Protection.

316
00:13:52,782 --> 00:13:55,316
And on the back
of this photo...

317
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:57,619
his alias and present address

318
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:59,420
in nowheresville, suburbia.

319
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:03,541
And in exchange, you want what?

320
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:07,161
Elias' support
in rebuilding HR.

321
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:11,933
[Phone dialing]

322
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,169
Hey, it's me.
I'm at the meeting.

323
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:19,057
So here's the deal.

324
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:26,347
The boss accepts your offer...

325
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,449
on one condition.

326
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,486
We're not interested
in going out and getting him.

327
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:35,123
The boss says
you bring Grifoni to us.

328
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:39,794
Then all is forgiven.

329
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,996
Consider it done.

330
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:58,096
Okay, cabbie,

331
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,098
what were you doing here
last night

332
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,384
for 25 minutes?

333
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:04,852
Carter!

334
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:06,771
Whoa, now this party's
really blowing up.

335
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:07,739
Who called you?

336
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,240
Nobody.
I was 10/6.

337
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,659
But you look kind of lost
out here, Terney.

338
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,528
- What's the story?
- I wish someone would tell me.

339
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,197
What we got is, uh...

340
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,782
this guy.

341
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,067
Seems like he's been dead
about nine hours.

342
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,402
Multiple gunshot wounds.

343
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:22,870
No ID.
Just the clothes on his back.

344
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:24,956
Who are the suits?
[Laughs]

345
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,341
Secret Service.

346
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,875
I don't know
who tipped 'em off,

347
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:29,377
but they were
all over that body

348
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:33,297
the minute we called it in.

349
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:39,920
Detective Carter,
Homicide Task Force.

350
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:41,139
Call you back.

351
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,975
Agent Regina Vickers,
Secret Service.

352
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,426
We got an ID on the body?

353
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:47,595
No offense, but this case
is "need to know."

354
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:48,929
No offense taken.

355
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:50,598
But, uh, if a body drops
in New York City,

356
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,202
we're gonna have to ID it.

357
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,454
Vadim Pushkov,
Russian national.

358
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,322
What we're mainly
concerned with

359
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,874
is if he had anything
on his person.

360
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,860
Has anything turned up yet?
A laptop? A phone?

361
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,213
Well, just some receipts,

362
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,081
and, uh-- and this.

363
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,000
Makes you wonder
where the other half went.

364
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,618
But we'll keep combing
the area.

365
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,721
He buys a pizza bagel
at JFK yesterday afternoon

366
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,757
and winds up dead
in Morningside Park

367
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,925
at 2:00 AM with no luggage.

368
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:19,427
Any idea how he got here?

369
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,179
Town car? Cab?

370
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,130
Maybe if we find out
who drove him here,

371
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:24,348
we could find the shooter.

372
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,184
Or a witness.

373
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,352
You canvass the area and
we'll check the security cams.

374
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,938
We find that car,
we'll find out who did this.

375
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,107
[Cell phone rings] Excuse me.

376
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,659
[Beep] Vickers here.

377
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,160
Hello, Detective.

378
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,696
So, GPS put your driver
at Morningside Park

379
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,748
for a window of 25 minutes
last night,

380
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,150
right around the time

381
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:47,422
some Russian guy succumbs
to acute lead poisoning.

382
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,458
And you think our cab driver
is connected to this homicide?

383
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,959
Figured you could tell me.

384
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:54,161
Along with, why are
the Secret Service crawling

385
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:55,296
all over this investigation?

386
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:56,964
I have no idea.

387
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:59,500
But whatever you can find out
would be much appreciated.

388
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:01,302
Unlikely,

389
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:02,520
considering they're
about as forthcoming

390
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,505
with information as you are.

391
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:07,692
I'll see what I can find out.

392
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,200
[Car door opens]

393
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,488
So what do we know
about the dead Russian

394
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,206
in the park, Finch?

395
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,741
Vadim Pushkov.

396
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,409
If the Secret Service
is involved,

397
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,628
he's likely some kind
of international criminal.

398
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,583
Seems like our cabbie gave
the wrong guy a ride last night.

399
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,221
Take the 59th Street bridge
into Queens.

400
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,840
Do you have an address?

401
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:41,058
No address.

402
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,428
Just go.

403
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,514
I can't seem to access
this woman's phone.

404
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:49,734
Either she doesn't have one,
or it's currently turned off.

405
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:59,193
They're taking the bridge
into Queens.

406
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:00,862
Now take this all the way down

407
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:04,665
and make a right on Vernon.

408
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,902
Got a bad feeling
about this, Finch.

409
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:09,403
Turn right up here.

410
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:12,406
Strange place for her
to be going.

411
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,350
One-way street
that bottlenecks down the way.

412
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:26,470
This is good right here.

413
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,589
They're stopped
in the middle of the block.

414
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,057
She's isolated him, Finch.

415
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,276
Uh, $11.50.

416
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,099
First, a few questions.

417
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,701
Excuse me?

418
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,204
A friend of mine
was in your cab last night.

419
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:47,107
Do you recognize him?

420
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:49,627
Uh, I see a lot of people...

421
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,795

You drove him.

423
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:55,283
Did he leave anything behind?

424

Do not lie to me.

Look, lady,

426

I turn in the cab every night.

427
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,924
Uh, if someone did leave
anything in here,

428
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:03,958
I didn't find it.

You're gonna want
to give me a lift anyway.

a pretty lousy day, okay?

a whole lot worse, Fermin.

I don't want any trouble.

Unfortunately, you and I don't
have much to say on that matter.

Now listen up.

We're about ready
to be boxed in by two cars.

- A little.

you need to tell me

what he left in your cab.

496
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:00,132
He left a laptop.

497
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:01,616
He left it underneath the seat.

498
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:02,884
He must have forgot.

499
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:04,886
What'd you do with it?

500
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,788
I sold it...

501
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,958
to a friend for money.

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,728
Look, I never do that,
but--

I drive him around all day

504
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:15,764
and then he stiffed me
on the tab.

505
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:18,650
- Finch, are you there?
- Always, Mr. Reese.

506
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:20,635
Sounds like this Pushkov had
some kind of a deal

507
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:22,404
to sell the laptop
to the Estonians.

508
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:23,972
But then he leaves it
in the cab?

509
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:25,357
He knew it would be dangerous.

510
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,075
He wanted to negotiate
a higher price.

511
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:31,446
Clearly, the Estonians
were in no mood to negotiate.

512
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:33,648
What in the world could be
on that laptop?

513
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,168
- Who are you talking to?
- My business partner.

514
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,253
Estonians don't care
if he doesn't have the laptop.

515
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:39,755
They'll kill him
just because he knew about it.

516
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:41,256
Just because of a laptop?

517
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:43,508
Because of what was on it,
and getting it back

518
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,544
may be the only leverage we have
to keep you alive.

519
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:48,597
Let's start
with the friend you sold it to.

520
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:11,653
Finch, looks like the Estonians
have been here already.

522
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:18,126
Sorry, Fermin.

523
00:23:18,128 --> 00:23:20,862
I sold him the laptop.

524
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:22,697
I got him killed.

525
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:26,251
- Is the laptop still here?
- I don't think so.

526
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:28,036
He told me he found a buyer
this morning.

527
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:29,087
He paid me my share.

528
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:30,889
Mr. Mansoor sold the laptop

529
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:33,341
before his demise
at the hands of the Estonians.

530
00:23:33,343 --> 00:23:36,544
They trashed this place
looking for it.

531
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:37,979
How'd they know to come here?

532
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:39,714
Pushkov may have installed
a beacon

533
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:41,549
that turns on
when you power it up.

534
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:43,384
Anyone with an access code

into Aziz's email account.

It appears
that he sold the laptop

named "d3mn8."

Any way we can track him?

542
00:23:56,784 --> 00:23:59,034
If d3mn8 discovers
what's on the laptop,

543
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:00,535
he may try to flip it.

544

to the darknet,

it worked.

was gonna make me rich,

588

it was over.

you can't make money.

he'd find another way

he hacked into
a drone pilot station in Nevada

that he's speaking about

Identification Database.

as he thinks he is.

Now he's in grave danger too.

714
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:19,285
I piggybacked on the signal
from his camera

715
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:23,289
and traced it back
to where he is right now.

716
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:26,059
I have an address
at Yeongson Pool Hall.

717
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:27,343

718

from the computer store.

We have Aziz Mansoor leaving
with the laptop.

About 45 minutes later,
he returns without it.

745
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:29,855
No laptop, hmm.
He must have sold it.

746
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:31,824
But look at this.

- You're not d3mn8.
- What do you know?

I know that he's sitting
right over there.

762

And if he's gonna remotely
monitor a wireless camera

763

with his phone,

764
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:28,131

He should take better care

to see the laptop first.

You're not with the Estonians.

No, I'm not.

774
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:04,000
You tried
to buy the laptop earlier.

775
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:05,668
But I didn't like
the way your partner looked.

776
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,970
So you arranged to make
a deal with the Estonians,

777
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:09,455
thinking they would pay more.

778
00:34:09,457 --> 00:34:10,973

What's the catch?

783
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,267
The catch...
Albert,

784
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,152
is that you leave
this very second,

785
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:26,022
disappear, and don't show
your face for at least a year.

786
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:28,441
Especially not
at your mom's house in Queens,

787
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:29,942
where you presently reside.

788
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:32,178
Take your money
and go far, far away.

789
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,864
Some very bad people
want that laptop.

790
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:36,249
And if they know
you've even seen it,

791
00:34:36,251 --> 00:34:39,318
they will kill you.

792
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,506
So that's the catch, Albert.

793
00:34:43,508 --> 00:34:45,491
Then why would you want it?

794
00:34:45,493 --> 00:34:46,876

Where is it?

892
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,854
Maybe he can get it to us,

00:39:32,856 --> 00:39:34,990
if we can help him out
with something.

894
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:36,408
And what's that?

895
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,826
It'll just take
a little bit of money

896
00:39:37,828 --> 00:39:41,663
and some help
from the Coast Guard.

Don't know
how you pulled that one off.

What's going on with Lionel?

What do you mean?

916
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:53,762
No reason.

You tell me.

'Cause they knew
we were coming for him.

We got double-crossed.

they shot bowman,

928

just walk away.
