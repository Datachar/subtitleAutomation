wreaked havoc at the LA Live
Entertainment Center today,

69
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:45,778
knocking over an armored truck.

70
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,881
Thanks to traffic cams and
the smart phone revolution,

71
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:51,417
we've got plenty of footage
of what went down.

72
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,503
They used the tourist traffic
to their advantage.

73
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:54,871
Looks like the circus

74
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:56,389

These guys are pros.

76
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,393
Fast, organized, and ruthless.

77
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:03,096
Fortunately, one of the guards
inside the truck survived,

78
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:04,847
despite suffering a head wound.

79
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:06,065
What was the cargo?

80
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:07,967
100 Good Delivery gold bars,

81
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:10,803
the type used
in major international markets,

82
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:12,272
central banks, and the IMF.

83
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:14,324
The bars were en route
from the Federal Reserve

84
00:05:14,326 --> 00:05:16,659
to the People's Bank of China.
How much we talking?

85
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,028
ERIC: The gold bars
weigh 12.4 kilos.

86
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,497
At $1,750 an ounce...

87
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:24,817
That's $700,000 a bar
or roughly...

88
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:26,169
$70 million.

89
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:27,754
(shudders)
Just got a gold rush.

90
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:29,038
What are we buying?

91
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,090
Time.

92
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:33,009
The gold is an interest payment

93
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:36,379
on a trillion dollar plus loan
we have with China.

94
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:40,099
If we can't recover it,
well, let's just say

95
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:42,852
we don't want them
to repossess Hawaii.

96
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:45,838
MAN: So we'll
keep you posted, okay?

97
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,507
Thanks.
Okay.

98
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:50,276

99
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:52,061

to have some big ones

100
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:54,664
to pull off a heist like this
in the middle of the day.

101
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,399
Yeah, no joke.
You find anything useful?

102
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:58,401
Not yet. You?

103
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:00,703
They had to have
left something.

104
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:03,189
ATM, traffic,
security cams--

105
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:05,608
it's an odd location
for a heist.

106
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,027
There's more surveillance
than LAX.

107
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:10,213
The motor home stops here.

108
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:12,548
Blocks off the armored car.

109
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,551
Bozo bounds from the curb.

110
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:19,389
Captain Sparrow wannabe points
his assault rifle,

111
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,474
then monkey boy
pulls up the cargo van.

112
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:23,042
Pretty sure
it was actually a gorilla.

113
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:24,560
Monkeys usually have tails.

114
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:26,562
They can't swing from branch
to branch like apes can.

115
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:28,564
They also can't drive
a cargo van.

116
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:31,067
I saw one drive a motorcycle
one time, so he probably could.

117
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:33,653
And I knew one that worked
in a bar in Huntington Beach

118
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:35,605
who could make a martini.

119
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:37,323
I'm not saying it was
a good martini.

120
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:43,780
We got blood.

121
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:52,004
He could have jumped into
their car or grabbed a cab.

122
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:55,124
Or dumped his disguise
and lost himself in the crowd.

123
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,915
Aw, damn!

124
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,851
You got to be kidding me.
What?

125
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:12,442
I hate clowns.

126
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:16,362
Yep, not nearly as funny
when they're dead, are they?

127
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:34,323
This clown is Clive Mayfield.

128
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:35,646
He's a well-known criminal

129
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,164
who's bounced around the country
with a number

130
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,699
of different heist crews.

131
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:41,034
He did time for armed robbery
at USP Atlanta.

132
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:43,537
We put together
a list of former associates,

133
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:45,172
some of whom are
from the LA area.

134
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,090
Hopefully one or more
were involved in the heist

135
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,675
and can lead us to the gold.

136
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,260
What's the word
on the guard he shot?

137
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,629
Lucky. Hospital says
he's up and around.

138
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:54,264
Kensi's on her way
to talk to him.

139
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,049
Well, hopefully he can
tell us something.

140
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:58,301
Sam and I will run down
Clive Mayfield

141
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,303
and his criminal buddies.

142
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:03,106
Maybe we'll get lucky, too.

143
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,892
Uh, where is Sam?

144
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:08,862
He's... dealing with something.

145
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,618
Coulrophobia.

146
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,453
Fear of clowns?

147
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,355
Is that even a real thing?

148
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:20,907
It is with Sam.

149
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:22,793
Weird.

150
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,961
Oh, yeah.

151
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,533
You don't, uh,

152
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:33,420
have any irrational phobias
I should know about, do you?

153
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:34,838
Well...

154
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,424
do you think hand puppets
are creepy?

155
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:39,976
Not particularly.

156
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,896
Yeah, me neither.

157
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,815
Ventriloquist dummies,
on the other hand...

158
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:47,784
Creepy, right?
Totally.

159
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:49,052
I used to have this nightmare

160
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:50,153
when I first
started working here.

161
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,439
It's the middle
of the night.

162
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:54,224
I'm here all alone.

163
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:57,277
I come up to Ops...

164
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,231
and there's somebody sitting
in the shadows.

165
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:06,441
And I can't see their face
'cause they're...

166
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:08,026
they're turned away from me,

167
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:11,363
but I can tell that there's...

168
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:14,032
There's something in their lap,

169
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:17,836
and I want to run,
but I can't.

170
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:20,572
And slowly they turn around,

171
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:22,791
and I see what they're holding.

172
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:26,211
It's...

173
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:28,296
Hetty.

174
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,767
The Treasury Department
is about to have

175
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,802
a China Syndrome meltdown.

176
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:36,588
So if you don't want
your paychecks

177
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,275
to bounce this week...

178
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:44,262
I suggest you forgo story time
and get cracking.

179
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:47,315
We are... cracking.

180
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:50,485
Crack, crack, cracking.

181
00:09:55,274 --> 00:09:58,660
(chuckles)

182
00:09:58,662 --> 00:10:01,880
That was weird.

183
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:09,387
Do you two need to be separated?

184
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:11,656
No.

185
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,642
No.

186
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:15,877
SAM (muffled):
Federal agents!

187
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:21,900
Clear.

188
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:23,602
Looks like Clive Mayfield

189
00:10:23,604 --> 00:10:25,020
left in a hurry.

190
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:26,738
Yeah, $70 million,

191
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,357
I'd be on my way
to my own private island.

192
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,026
What, you don't spend
enough time alone?

193
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:33,028
You know what I'm gonna do?

194
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,146
I'm gonna buy you a yacht,
so you can come visit me.

195
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:37,449
Make it a private jet
and I just might.

196
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:38,917
You'd buy a jet?

197
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,535
No, I'd make you buy me a jet.

198
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:42,370
I'd open up an auto body shop.

199
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:45,373
$70 million, and you're gonna
become a mechanic?

200
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,158
Auto science specialist.

201
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,493
It's a calling.

202
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:50,095
I'd open a place

203
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:51,763
where people could go
without getting ripped off.

204
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,882
Yeah, no need for cars
on the island.

205
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:56,718
What, you and Gilligan gonna
build a bike out of coconuts?

206
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,854
Think there's anything
in there?

207
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:00,355
Nope.

208
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:02,023
What, is this for
hamsters or something?

209
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:03,558
Only if they're food.

210
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,510
This is for a snake.

211
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:07,845
By the size of this tank,
I'd say a big one.

212
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:09,648
You think the owner took it
with him?

213
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,318
I sure as hell hope so.

214
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,619
You seen enough?

215
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:15,620
Oh, yeah.

216
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:17,038
Yeah.

217
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,524
G?

218
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:20,575
It's okay.

219
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:23,161
Just a false alarm.

220
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:33,722
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

221
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:54,326
Jack?

222
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:55,893
Jack Williams?

223
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:57,829
Yeah, that's what
they're telling me.

224
00:11:57,831 --> 00:11:59,531
I'm Special Agent Blye.

225
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:02,066
I was hoping to talk to you
about the robbery this morning.

226
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:05,236
I watched it on the news but
I... I still don't remember it.

227
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:07,872
It's not unusual
in traumatic situations.

228
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:10,759
Yeah, they said that, too.

229
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:13,795
They also said
I'm lucky to be alive, but...

230
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:16,097
I don't feel too lucky.

231
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:19,851
You may feel it's insignificant,

232
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:22,253
but any little detail
that you could recall

233
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,105
from this morning's heist
would be useful.

234
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:27,475
Accent of the thieves,
jargon they used,

235
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:29,861
even the smell of their cologne
would be helpful.

236
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:32,981
They say I killed a man.

237
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:36,451
And I don't remember
firing my gun.

238
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:38,987
I don't remember anything.

239
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:43,291
You see that woman
and those kids?

240
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:48,296
They say that's my wife
and-and children.

241
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:53,752
But I don't recognize them.

242
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:57,589
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:57,591 --> 00:13:00,091
No, I'm... I'm-I'm sorry.

244
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:02,560
Look, I'd like to help you,

245
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,462
but I can't.

246
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,481
And to be honest, I...

247
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:10,402
All I want to do right now is
just remember who the hell I am.

248
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,521
Okay.

249
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:17,308
Jack...

250
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,362
when you do remember
something.

251
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:33,842
Well?

252
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:38,179
He says he doesn't
remember anything.

253
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:39,547
You believe him?

254
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,349
Sounds pretty convincing.

255
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,219
That heist was
pretty damn slick.

256
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:46,354
It'd pay to have a man
on the inside.

257
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:47,689
They shot him in the head.

258
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:49,641
What better way
to cover your tracks.

259
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:51,860
That would explain
the sudden amnesia.

260
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:55,447
Put a guard on him.

261
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:57,532
In case he runs?

262
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:59,617
Or they come back
and finish the job.

263
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:02,570
Copy that.

264
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:04,155
So, I'll see you back at Ops?

265
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:05,824
Nice try-- you're my ride.

266
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:09,127
Besides, you and I could use
some quality time.

267
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:11,379
Awesome.

268
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:22,206
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

269
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,875
Yeah, what do
you got, Nell?

270
00:14:23,877 --> 00:14:26,511
I got a hit
on a clown costume.

271
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,097
Yeah, pass that
one on to Kensi.

272
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:30,565
She can check it out
on her way back.

273
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,517
Also, can you run a search
of recent purchases

274
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,202
of snake supplies
in the area?

275
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:35,236
What kind of snake?

276
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:36,905
A big one.
NELL: Okay.

277
00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:38,490
Thanks.

278
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:40,191
I know
it's irrational.

279
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:41,860
I didn't say anything.

280
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:45,680
(electronic door bell chimes)

281
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:47,115
Assistant Director,

282
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:49,200
do you not trust me
to handle this on my own?

283
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:51,453
Don't like being under the
microscope, Agent Blye?

284
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:52,620
No, it's not that--

285
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:54,739
Because you are.
What?

286
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,040
I'm kidding.

287
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,509
Okay, you're
a very busy man.

288
00:14:57,511 --> 00:14:59,928
I'm just maintaining
protocol, Agent Blye.

289
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,546
Don't take it personally.

290
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:03,631
Besides, performance
reviews are due.

291
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,683
Oh...
Great choice.

292
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:07,352
Comes with tear-away trousers,

293
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:09,471
bow tie, collar, cuffs.

294
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:11,272
Six-pack not included.

295
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:13,775
But we should
have your size.

296
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:15,059
Nothing like a little

297
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:18,213
role-play to spice up
the bedroom.

298
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:23,701
We're Federal agents.

299
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:25,570
I don't judge.

300
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:27,605
Uh, yesterday we had
a couple nuns in here,

301
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,791
bought leather cat suits.

302
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:31,442
All right, that's just weird.

303
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:34,496
You sold some costumes
to a guy a few days ago:

304
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,714
a gorilla, a clown, a pirate...

305
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,833
No refunds, exchange only.

306
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:41,719
We don't need a refund--
we need some answers.

307
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:44,255
Do you recognize
this guy?

308
00:15:45,307 --> 00:15:46,474
Nope.

309
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:48,927
You recognize him
in your costume?

310
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:53,932
No exchanges once it's worn.

311
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:54,799
That guy's dead.

312
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:56,100
No exceptions.

313
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:57,285
Who bought the costume?

314
00:15:57,287 --> 00:15:59,020
It wasn't the guy
who was wearing it?

315
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:01,138
Look...

316
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,473
I sell a lot of costumes.

317
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:04,692
I'm still restocking
from Halloween.

318
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:06,444
Okay, we're gonna need your
credit card records then.

319
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:08,613
(scoffs) Transaction
fees are murder

320
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:10,782
on a small business
owner-- cash only.

321
00:16:10,784 --> 00:16:13,001
Fine, we'll take your
surveillance tapes.

322
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:14,252
40 bucks.

323
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:15,253
We're not buying them from you,

324
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:16,671
we're Federal Agents.

325
00:16:16,673 --> 00:16:17,956
Okay, 20 bucks.

326
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:19,991
How about we shut your shop down

327
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:21,042
for running a meth lab

328
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:22,377
out of the basement?

329
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,829
Meth lab?!
There's no meth lab here.

330
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,631
Uh, there's no basement here.

331
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,666
Maybe not, but can
a small business owner

332
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:31,135
such as yourself
survive the red tape?

333
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:34,189
Hm?

334
00:16:37,726 --> 00:16:40,061
I'll be right back.

335
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:42,831
Wonderful.

336
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:46,901
"Grizzled vet," huh?

337
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:55,543
Meet Duncan Welch,
full-time criminal,

338
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:57,712
part-time pirate.

339
00:16:57,714 --> 00:16:59,814
His rap sheet reads
like a companion piece

340
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,666
to our dead clown
Clive Mayfield.

341
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,718
Do you think these guys
pick out their own costumes?

342
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,837
Like, maybe two
of 'em wanted

343
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,338
to be the pirate,
and then one of 'em's like,

344
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,973
"I called it," and the other
one's like, "You always

345
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:11,175
get to be the pirate.
I never get to be the pirate."

346
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:12,376
And the other one's
like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,

347
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:13,811
"you got to be
the pirate last time.

348
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:15,096
"This time I'm gonna
be the pirate,

349
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:16,931
and you get to be
the clown, sucker."

350
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:22,219
Just, you know, thinking maybe
their choice of disguise

351
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:24,022
might give you some insight
into these guys.

352
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:27,108
Psychological profiling
through costume choice?

353
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,694
Sounds silly when you say it like that.
NELL: No, it's...

354
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:32,580
it's an interesting theory,
but I think it might just be...

355
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:34,832
easier to check
his last known address.

356
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,334
Uh, 1274

357
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:38,253
Hillcrest Road, Sylmar.

358
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:39,871
Or you could do that.

359
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:42,590
Thank you, guys.
Mm-hmm.

360
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:45,593
If I robbed a bank,
I'd totally be the cowboy.

361
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:47,211
You?

362
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:49,881
Well, I...
wouldn't rob a bank,

363
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:53,051
but, clearly, you've
given this some thought.

364
00:17:55,854 --> 00:17:58,139
(scoffs)

365
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:00,975
(engine roaring,
tires screeching)

366
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:07,398
Federal agents!

367
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,885
All clear.

368
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:29,787
Looks like they
were executed.

369
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:30,788
Is that everyone?

370
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,340
Everyone but Duncan Welch,

371
00:18:32,342 --> 00:18:33,958
the guy we're
looking for.

372
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,510
He was here.

373
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:52,498
KENSI: Nell and Eric
confirmed the I.D.s

374
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,883
of the heist crew.

375
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:55,617
We have Patrick Rodgers,

376
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:58,587
Derrick Stovall,
and Marcus Terry.

377
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:00,306
Duncan Welch took the gold,
killed his buddies.

378
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,557
KENSI:
It's easier

379
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,393
to divide by one than by four.
Five.

380
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:06,301
Still need to find Duncan
and the cargo van driver.

381
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:07,147
KENSI: Okay.

382
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:08,464
I'll put out a BOLO:

383
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:11,066
male, six feet tall,
dark hair...

384
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,018
covering his entire body,

385
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,687
partial to bananas...

386
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:16,355
Duncan's partner
in the double cross?

387
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:17,990
Well, unless there's another
Dumpster out there

388
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:19,358
with a dead monkey in it.

389
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,659
Gorilla.

390
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,811
Apparently monkeys have tails.

391
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:25,865
Okay. Well, according
to his bank records,

392
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:28,300
Duncan Welch was spending a lot
of money before the heist.

393
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:29,668
Confident man.

394
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,321
Either that or someone was
bankrolling the heist.

395
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:34,340
Someone who's willing to piss
off the Treasury Department

396
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:36,658
and the Chinese government.
What was he buying?

397
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,794
Um, that's where it
gets interesting.

398
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:40,662
KENSI:
Check this out.

399
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:42,882
Lots of dinners,
jewelry,

400
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:44,183
women's lingerie.

401
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:46,051
Sounds like Duncan's
got a girlfriend.

402
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,137
Or a cross-dressing fetish.

403
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,190
Hey, we know he likes
to dress up.

404
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:52,942
You got his phone records?

405
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:54,143
KENSI:
Yes, I do.

406
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,696
CALLEN:
Hello, Gloria Bryant.

407
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,348
Could be a business associate.

408
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,150
From 9:00 a.m.
to 7:00 p.m., maybe.

409
00:20:01,152 --> 00:20:02,952
But from midnight to 3:00 a.m.--

410
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:04,487
that's a booty call.

411
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,407
Well, you know,
when two people call each other

412
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,125
in the middle of the night
and they're lonely

413
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,744
and they want to...

414
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:13,128
Is that what that's called?

415
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,914
I'm gonna shut up now.

416
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,832
Have an address, I got this.

417
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,834
Uh-huh.
I'm gonna go.

418
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:20,702
Ms. Blye?

419
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:22,471
Let me guess: more quality time?

420
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:25,174
No, I was gonna say
be safe, but...

421
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:27,176
I can join you if you like.

422
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:28,227
No, no.

423
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:29,728
I'm good.

424
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,880
I'm out.

425
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:42,224
Gloria Bryant?

426
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:43,342
Federal agent.

427
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:44,910
Um...

428
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,078
It's okay.

429
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,947
I'm looking for Duncan Welch.

430
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:49,114
GLORIA:
Oh, uh...

431
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:50,583
I haven't seen him.

432
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:53,285
Which, unfortunately,
is par for the course.

433
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,287
He just disappears

434
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:57,072
without a word
and then...

435
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:59,375
pops back up
like nothing's wrong.

436
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:01,844
Men.
Yeah, right?

437
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:03,796
I mean, I just figured
he was seeing somebody else.

438
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:06,265
Never thought it was
something illegal.

439
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:08,083
Gran Gran loved him.

440
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,635
Is that your grandmother?

441
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:11,937
Uh, yeah.
He'd sit with her sometimes

442
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,472
during her game shows.

443
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:16,108
Aw. Do you know
where I can find him?

444
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:19,194
No.

445
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,614
Although I might know
somebody who might.

446
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:24,233
He used to go fishing
with his buddy, Oki.

447
00:21:24,235 --> 00:21:25,734
Lives in Ojai.

448
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,620
I might have, like,
a birthday card or something

449
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:28,988
with his return address.

450
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,824
Great.
I'll go get it.

451
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:33,993
Thanks.

452
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,786
Gran Gran would be
so disappointed right now.

453
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:46,338
Where's Duncan?

454
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,756
I don't know.

455
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:50,125
And yet you ran.

456
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,679
Do you recognize
any of these men?

457
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:55,848
Oh, my God.

458
00:21:57,634 --> 00:21:59,768
No.
No?

459
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,470
Well, I'll give you a hint.

460
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,439
They all had two things
in common.

461
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:05,658
One, they were all friends
of Duncan.

462
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,143
Two, as you can see,
they're all dead.

463
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:11,113
Now that means that either
Duncan is a murderer,

464
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:13,248
or he's next on the killer's
list, do you understand that?

465
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,000
That means he's
in serious trouble,

466
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,535
and the only way
you can help him

467
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:19,588
is if you tell me where he is.

468
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,434
(sipping)

469
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:44,196
Are you going to tell me?

470
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,531
Tell you what?

471
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:47,316
(chuckles)

472
00:22:47,318 --> 00:22:51,286
Oh, you've gotten better.
I'll grant you that.

473
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:53,789
I had a good teacher.

474
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:57,793
You're in my house now, Owen.

475
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:01,830
I hope you don't truly
believe that, Henrietta.

476
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:04,866
He's not an NCIS agent.

477
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:07,302
Then he really isn't
your concern, is he?

478
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,672
So much for our detente.

479
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:11,173
Are we done?

480
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:13,926
He may not be NCIS,

481
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:17,763
but Mr. Deeks is one of my team.

482
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:20,482
If anything should
happen to him,

483
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:23,602
I would take it most personally.

484
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,994
Duncan Welch?

485
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:33,746
Federal agents!

486
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,280
Hands where we
can see them.

487
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:36,915
Got a body.

488
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,683
SAM:
He bled out.

489
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,935
Looks like hours.

490
00:23:57,554 --> 00:23:59,805
(crash, then clattering)

491
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:01,106
Guys?

492
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,265
Apparently this is
the end of the rainbow.

493
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:12,901
Always thought it'd be
a little more festive.

494
00:24:13,903 --> 00:24:15,454
HETTY:
<i>Well done.</i>

495
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:18,123
Assistant Director
Granger called

496
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,958
to congratulate all of you

497
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,660
on solving the
case so quickly.

498
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:24,112
There's still one
person unaccounted for.

499
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,582
We still don't know if he was
Duncan's partner in all this

500
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:29,051
or if he killed Duncan
and the others.

501
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,753
Well, take it from me,

502
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:33,789
they were more concerned
about their precious gold.

503
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:36,809
Ms. Blye, with me.

504
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:39,127
Something's not right.

505
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:40,629
That was too easy.

506
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:42,264
We're good, but we're
not that good.

507
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:44,399
Whoever killed Duncan
left him with the gold.

508
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:45,934
Why?

509
00:24:45,936 --> 00:24:47,269
He was at death's door.

510
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:48,854
The shooter could have casually
hauled away the gold.

511
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:50,355
Why not take it?

512
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:51,406
We could've spooked him.

513
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,909
Got there before
they had a chance.

514
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:57,145
Or maybe they
wanted us to find it.

515
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:05,420
(drill whirring)

516
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,456
(drill stops)

517
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,008
Tungsten.

518
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:13,796
It's bogus.

519
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:31,528
Tungsten: It's the 74th element
on the periodic table.

520
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,864
Its name derives from
the Swedish <i>tung sten,</i>

521
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,983
meaning "heavy stone."

522
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:39,101
Uh, its chemical
symbol is a "W"

523
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:41,938
because it was formerly
known as wolfram.

524
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,440
AKA my favorite element.

525
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:47,577
Nell's is ununoctium.

526
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,045
Don't.

527
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,213
SAM:
Ah...

528
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,881
young geek love.

529
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,499
But I digress.

530
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:54,667
NELL:
Tungsten and gold are

531
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:56,169
similar in weight, making it

532
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,171
the perfect
counterfeit substance.

533
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:00,340
Well, who would want
to steal fake gold?

534
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:01,808
SAM:
Maybe they didn't know,

535
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,476
or maybe it wasn't fake.

536
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,178
Whoever stole it
pulled a switch.

537
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,596
Okay, well, then
where's the real gold?

538
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,648
Comes back to the
cargo van driver.

539
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,266
CALLEN:
If they melted the real gold

540
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,901
to coat more bars of tungsten...

541
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,270
You could duplicate the gold
bars several times over.

542
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,856
Turning millions into billions
before anyone got caught.

543
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:19,859
Why didn't I think of that?

544
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:23,029
Um, so I could
solve the case.

545
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:24,530
I'm not a thief.

546
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:26,916
Is there something we should
know about you, Eric?

547
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,001
(clears throat)

548
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,869
Uh, what do you,
what do you got for us, Nell?

549
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:31,754
Anyway...

550
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,506
tungsten is about
50 bucks a kilo

551
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,174
and the gold bars
are 12.4 kilos each,

552
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,760
so we're talking about
a loof weight.

553
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,596
Eric, we're gonna need to know
who's been buying tungsten.

554
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,048
And we're gonna need somewhere
where we can smelt it.

555
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,466
(snickering)

556
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,018
I'm sorry, it's just...

557
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,102
it's just, like,
one of those words.

558
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,186
I can't explain it.

559
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:51,190
Well, I will investigate
the smelting operation.

560
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,142
(laughing):
Smelting.

561
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,144
I'm sorry.

562
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,280
I'm sorry,
I just can't explain it.

563
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:02,201
Mr. Callen? A word.

564
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,988
<i>You know there's</i>
<i>more going on here</i>

565
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,706
than catching a thief.

566
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,659
You mean how this could
affect our economy?

567
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,160
If it were to get out

568
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:15,465
that America's gold
reserves were compromised,

569
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,202
it would wreak havoc
on our banking system.

570
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,889
I'm wondering if that's
been the plan all along.

571
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,842
If it is, we're not looking
for a heist crew.

572
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,511
This could be an economic
terrorist attack.

573
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,763
How's the world gonna react

574
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:34,233
if we try to pay off a debt
to China using fake gold?

575
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,768
Not very well indeed.

576
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,520
So who benefits
from sowing discontent

577
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,939
between two superpowers?

578
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:41,407
Exactly.

579
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:45,445
Who and why is just as
important as finding the gold.

580
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:49,065
The country's already facing
a fiscal challenge.

581
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,702
If this were to get out,

582
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,123
it could destroy the economy
once and for all.

583
00:28:02,963 --> 00:28:05,181
Wolfram, you get any hits
on the tungsten?

584
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,599
Too many to count.

585
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,134
I'm trying to
narrow it down.

586
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:09,686
What about the smelting?

587
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,937
(snorts, snickers)

588
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,139
(chuckling):
Smelting.

589
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:15,725
How is it that you find
"smelting" to be so funny

590
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,544
and "frelting" to be
absolutely horrifying?

591
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:22,532
Did you find anything?

592
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,866
No, uh, not on the furnace,

593
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,103
but have you heard of
the Reptile Super Show?

594
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,455
Yeah.
It's in Pomona next month.

595
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,773
It's, like, world's largest.

596
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,658
I'm sorry,
you know this how?

597
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,626
Yeah, I went with my ex...

598
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,411
(clears throat):
With my friend.

599
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,280
Oh. Interesting.

600
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:41,884
So, what, is it like a dog show?

601
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,254
Do they dress their lizards up
in little outfits

602
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,223
and parade 'em around a ring?

603
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,010
No, and there's no outfits
in dog shows either.

604
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:53,346
We only do that to children.

605
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:54,814
Great.

606
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,933
Well, short of being
a herpetologist,

607
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,235
I never understood
the allure of owning a snake.

608
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,187
You don't like pets?

609
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:03,606
I mean, shouldn't a pet
be something you can,

610
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:04,857
I don't know, pet?

611
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:05,858
Hence the name.

612
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,309
You can pet a snake.

613
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:10,530
Can if you wanted to.

614
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,532
Do snakes like being petted?

615
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:17,820
This just took a really
weird turn, didn't it?

616
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,455
Yeah.

617
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,658
I'm think I'm gonna go
catch up with the guys.

618
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,094
But maybe we should run
a multivariable search

619
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,512
where you cross-reference
the tungsten

620
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,930
with the smelting
facilities?

621
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,298
(snickers)

622
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,850
(laughs)
Sorry.

623
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,769
Yeah.

624
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,972
(snickering)

625
00:29:39,393 --> 00:29:41,477
Agent Blye, how did it go
with Gloria Bryant?

626
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,012
She tried to give me the slip,

627
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,198
"tried" being the
operative word,

628
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,649
but you're the
Assistant Director.

629
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,768
I'm sure you've
been briefed, sir.

630
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,987
Touché. Any new leads?

631
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,355
Yes. There are some details
that need to be run down.

632
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:54,523
Hopefully, they'll pan out.

633
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:55,741
All right, good job.

634
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:58,744
Keep me posted.

635
00:29:58,746 --> 00:30:01,464
Oh, uh, I hope I get
that gold star

636
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,832
in my performance review, sir.

637
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,134
P-Rs are below my pay grade.

638
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,552
Oh. But before, you said that...

639
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,087
Disregard that.

640
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:10,923
Okay, then what was all that

641
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:14,510
ride-along, quality-time
stuff all about?

642
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,845
Just keeping you on your toes.

643
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,097
Think of it more as
an evaluation.

644
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,016
For...?

645
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,185
I'm an ambitious man,
Agent Blye,

646
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,403
who won't be
Assistant Director forever,

647
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,690
and you need to think
about the future.

648
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,161
You never know.

649
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:37,283
Good luck with the case.

650
00:30:41,388 --> 00:30:43,389
<i>I just had the strangest</i>
<i>encounter with Granger.</i>

651
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:45,958
Everything about Granger is
strange, if you ask me.

652
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,043
What do you have?

653
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,128
Um, a cargo van was stolen

654
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,297
from a rental lot in
Toluca Lake last month.

655
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,582
Surprise, surprise.

656
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:55,051
Hey, Sam, do you still
want me looking

657
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,352
for reptile supplies?

658
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,020
No.
Okay.

659
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,055
Where are we?

660
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,523
Nowhere.

661
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,091
Come on, guys,
we're missing something.

662
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:04,894
Everyone leaves a trail
everywhere they go

663
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,362
whether they know it or not.

664
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,447
We know they have a cargo van,

665
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:12,151
guns, ammo...

666
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:13,569
Costumes.

667
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,988
They paid for parking,
paid for gas.

668
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,439
They could have stopped
for Starbucks.

669
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:20,209
Somebody has to have
left a clue somewhere.

670
00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:23,996
Tungsten.

671
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:25,614
Who needs it?
What's it used for?

672
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:26,999
NELL:
Everything,

673
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:29,752
from electronics to
chemical catalysts.

674
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,137
That's part of the problem.

675
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,139
We need to focus on anomalies.

676
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,507
Cross-reference
everything we have

677
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:36,309
on Duncan, his crew, the heist,

678
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,843
and find the guy behind
the gorilla mask.

679
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,628
He's the key.

680
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,681
But what if they've already
moved the gold out of L.A.?

681
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:45,768
ERIC:
Hey, guys.

682
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:47,970
Found something.

683
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,022
A company called
Carlisle Industries purchased

684
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:55,077
a tilting smelting
furnace for $37,000.

685
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,313
That's one expensive
turkey fryer.

686
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,832
According to this, Carlisle
Industries manufactures

687
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,151
custom tungsten
alloy crankshafts

688
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,287
for the after-market
auto industry.

689
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,205
So it could be
a legitimate purchase.

690
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:07,840
Possible, but unlikely.

691
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,376
Carlisle Industries didn't
exist a month ago.

692
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:11,827
And here's the clincher:

693
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,463
Last week, Carlisle
Industries received

694
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,133
a half-ton shipment of tungsten.

695
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,168
There's our anomaly.

696
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:44,774
What are we thinking, Kens?

697
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,443
1,700 degrees.

698
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:48,745
They're cooking something.

699
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:49,963
You ready?

700
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:51,414
Yup.

701
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,616
Okay, we are up and running.

702
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,388
Where's she hiding
the camera?

703
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,224
Somewhere she's sure to have
his full attention.

704
00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:03,677
You know I can hear you, right?

705
00:33:07,264 --> 00:33:09,099
KENSI:
Hi.

706
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:10,984
Can I, uh...

707
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:12,319
help you?

708
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:15,138
Yes, I am Wendy
with the IPA.

709
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:19,809
Industrial Park Association.

710
00:33:19,811 --> 00:33:22,529
Our records show that
Carlisle Industries is overdue

711
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:24,331
for an OSHA safety inspection.

712
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,316
Yeah. Okay, uh...

713
00:33:27,318 --> 00:33:30,286
The thing is, my boss,
he isn't here right now.

714
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:33,089
Can you, um,
leave a card

715
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:34,874
or a number and...

716
00:33:34,876 --> 00:33:37,260
I'll make sure he calls you back
to set up an appointment.

717
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:39,796
Nothing says welcome like having
a 300-pound Neanderthal

718
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:41,264
crammed behind a desk.

719
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:44,050
First impressions are important.

720
00:33:44,052 --> 00:33:46,502
I'm sorry, Mr.--?
Remo.

721
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:49,055
Right. This is why
I'm here now, Mr. Remo.

722
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:50,673
This is my appointment.

723
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,008
Well, you're gonna
have to reschedule,

724
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,476
'cause I'm about to lock up.

725
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:54,778
Why don't you call your boss?

726
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,646
I don't know where he is.

727
00:33:56,648 --> 00:33:57,897
Well, then find him.

728
00:33:57,899 --> 00:33:59,582
Look... honey...

729
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:01,034
Shouldn't have said that.

730
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:02,535
Big mistake.

731
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:04,537
Excuse me?

732
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:05,989
My boss isn't here.

733
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:09,325
I'm about to lock up,
and you're leaving now.

734
00:34:10,294 --> 00:34:12,412
I'm gonna put this in my report.

735
00:34:12,414 --> 00:34:13,580
Oh, you do that.

736
00:34:13,582 --> 00:34:14,798
Eric.

737
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,249
Looks like Kensi
could use a little help.

738
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:18,918
We're on it.
Colossus, line one

739
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,471
and a two and a three...

740
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:23,039
(phone lines ringing)

741
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,145
(chuckles)

742
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:38,988
Sorry about that, "honey."

743
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:44,277
All right.

744
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:50,683
(grunts, muffled shout)

745
00:35:14,141 --> 00:35:16,926
(low, indistinct conversation)

746
00:35:48,425 --> 00:35:50,626
(door clicks shut)

747
00:35:53,347 --> 00:35:55,565
(clanging)

748
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:04,858
I'll check that way.

749
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:28,131
Shh.

750
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,167
(grunting)

751
00:36:46,183 --> 00:36:47,901
(muffled grunt)

752
00:36:57,628 --> 00:36:59,528
(grunting)

753
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:15,678
(gunshots)

754
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,130
(grunts)

755
00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:28,942
I had him.

756
00:37:28,944 --> 00:37:30,660
Course you did.

757
00:37:30,662 --> 00:37:32,528
Obviously.

758
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:35,564
Whatever.

759
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:50,179
CALLEN: Forget armed robbery, assault,
economic terrorism,

760
00:37:50,181 --> 00:37:53,049
and several prison lifetimes'
worth of lesser charges--

761
00:37:53,051 --> 00:37:55,268
we got seven counts
of murder, gentlemen.

762
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,603
Seven.

763
00:37:56,605 --> 00:37:58,471
But only one envelope.

764
00:37:58,473 --> 00:38:00,756
In case you didn't already
know it, that gold you stole

765
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:02,392
was essentially the
vig Uncle Sam owes

766
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:04,093
on a loan to
the Chinese.

767
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:05,478
Why don't you tell them
what they won, Sam?

768
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,863
Well, in the interest

769
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:09,032
of international cooperation
and full disclosure,

770
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:12,118
we've agreed to send one
of you lucky contestants

771
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,287
back to Shanghai
for questioning.

772
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:15,321
That's right,
an all-expense-paid trip

773
00:38:15,323 --> 00:38:16,706
to the land of Ping-Pong, panda,

774
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,074
and human rights violations.

775
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:21,044
But... only one
of you gentlemen can go.

776
00:38:21,046 --> 00:38:22,662
So talk amongst yourselves,

777
00:38:22,664 --> 00:38:24,497
and in 1,200 words or less,

778
00:38:24,499 --> 00:38:26,049
tell us who is most deserving

779
00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:28,117
to go and why.

780
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,420
CALLEN:
Good luck, gentlemen.

781
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,591
(door shuts)

782
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:37,310
(sighs)

783
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,512
How long do you think
before they rat each other out?

784
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:42,565
Man, as long as it takes
for Panda Express.

785
00:38:44,985 --> 00:38:46,469
What was in the envelope?

786
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,821
Lakers tickets.

787
00:38:48,823 --> 00:38:50,773
<i>My</i> Lakers tickets?

788
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:53,609
(sighs)

789
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:57,030
Come in.

790
00:38:57,032 --> 00:38:58,247
Hey.

791
00:38:58,249 --> 00:38:59,449
Hi.

792
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:00,833
Your family gone?

793
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:02,752
Yeah, Tracy had
to take the kids home.

794
00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:04,337
It was past their bedtime.

795
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:06,372
So, you starting to remember?

796
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:08,624
Yeah, and doctors say I should
get more and more each day.

797
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:09,926
That's great.

798
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:11,244
I still don't remember
getting married

799
00:39:11,246 --> 00:39:12,729
or my kids being born but...

800
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:14,714
But you will.

801
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:16,516
I hope so.

802
00:39:16,518 --> 00:39:18,468
On the other hand,
I wish

803
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,436
I could forget
what happened today.

804
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:24,357
I had two tours in Afghanistan
and I never shot anybody before.

805
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:26,893
You got to take the good
with the bad.

806
00:39:26,895 --> 00:39:29,228
It was self-defense.

807
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,648
Anyway, I just wanted
to check in

808
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,901
and let you know
that we caught the guys,

809
00:39:34,903 --> 00:39:36,703
thanks in part to what you did.

810
00:39:36,705 --> 00:39:38,071
Appreciate it.

811
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:40,156
Get some rest.

812
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:41,240
I will.

813
00:39:41,242 --> 00:39:42,742
Thanks, Agent...

814
00:39:42,744 --> 00:39:44,944
Um... I-I'm sorry.

815
00:39:44,946 --> 00:39:46,262
Blye.

816
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:48,697
I know. I was just messin'
with you.

817
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:52,335
Bullet missed
your funny bone obviously.

818
00:39:52,337 --> 00:39:54,537
Take care.

819
00:39:56,974 --> 00:39:59,008
(laughs softly)

820
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,144
ERIC:
Guys, facial rec got a hit

821
00:40:01,146 --> 00:40:03,930
on the man
behind the gorilla mask.

822
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:06,599
NELL: Jahveed Abbasi,
Iranian Nationalist.

823
00:40:06,601 --> 00:40:08,484
ERIC:
Countless bombings

824
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:11,320
in Israel, Europe, Iraq.

825
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:13,272
Does not play well with others.

826
00:40:13,274 --> 00:40:15,124
It sounds like this wasn't
just a heist

827
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:16,692
but a state-sanctioned
terrorist attack

828
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:18,111
on our financial infrastructure.

829
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,413
Either way, we stopped it.

830
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:21,531
This time.

831
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:22,515
Good work, guys.

832
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:24,951
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

833
00:40:24,953 --> 00:40:27,069
Uh, you...

834
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:28,788
you two leaving?

835
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:31,340
Yeah.

836
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:32,675
Together?

837
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:34,927
Uh, I don't know.

838
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:37,079
Are we?
(chuckles)

839
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:40,016
I mean, we're going home
simultaneously.

840
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:42,635
Roughly the same
direction, so...

841
00:40:42,637 --> 00:40:44,854
That wasn't meant to be
a skill-testing question.

842
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:46,922
(chuckles nervously)
Ha!

843
00:40:46,924 --> 00:40:49,609
Nice.

844
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:51,644
What was that?

845
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:52,945
Don't ask, don't tell?

846
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:54,280
(chuckles)

847
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:55,948
HETTY:
"O accursed hunger

848
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,533
"of gold,

849
00:40:57,535 --> 00:41:01,988
to what dost thou

Virgil.

851
00:41:03,408 --> 00:41:05,124
HETTY: Too bad
those two you put

852
00:41:05,126 --> 00:41:07,610
in the boatshed
aren't as well versed

853
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:09,212
in the classics.

854
00:41:09,214 --> 00:41:11,798
But they are singing
like the Vienna Boys' Choir

855
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,816
and pointing a finger
back at Iran.

856
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:16,502
Yeah, Tehran would love to see
us get into it with China.

857
00:41:16,504 --> 00:41:18,171
It would take the heat off them.

858
00:41:18,173 --> 00:41:20,089
Better luck next time.

859
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:21,957
Let's hope not.

860
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,843
And after this evening,

861
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:27,630
none of us ever need
speak of this again.

862
00:41:28,732 --> 00:41:30,149
(quietly):
It's in the vault.

863
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:32,351
Speak about what?

864
00:41:34,304 --> 00:41:36,856
"The man who can keep
a secret may be wise,

865
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:38,524
"but he is not half as wise

866
00:41:38,526 --> 00:41:40,860
as the man who has
no secrets to keep."

867
00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:43,079
Edgar Watson Howe.

868
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:46,482
And yet it's a necessary evil

869
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:48,984
in our business, I'm afraid.

870
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:51,487
Good night, Mr. Callen.
