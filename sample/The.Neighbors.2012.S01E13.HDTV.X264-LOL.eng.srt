1
00:00:01,991 --> 00:00:03,758
You're the only one
who agrees with me.

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:06,196
Yeah. I don't get
the vampire thing, either.

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:07,578
They're all
in such bad moods.

4
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:09,401
I know.
They're so mopey.

5
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:11,669
It's like, so you're undead.

6
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,856
Cheer up and get a tan,
am I right?

7
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:15,242
You are right.

8
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:16,664
(Both blow raspberry)

9
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,127
- That was good.
- Yeah?

10
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:19,178
Just like I showed you.

11
00:00:19,198 --> 00:00:21,090
- So, Amber...
- Well done, Weaver.

12
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,962
Thank you.

13
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,099
What was that for?

14
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,364
Nothing.
Um, what were you saying?

15
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,399
Uh, well, um...

16
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:31,114
I've been hearing quite a bit of talk
about an upcoming dance.

17
00:00:31,134 --> 00:00:32,060
Yeah?

18
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,278
And I was wondering if...

19
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:35,395
You would...

20
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:36,853
(Speaks indistinctly)
Wow, Amber, nice score.

21
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:39,029
Thank you so much.

22
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:40,871
Sorry. I'm totally distracted.

23
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:42,405
Jeremy asked me
to the dance.

24
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:44,743
Oh.

25
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,232
I know. It's crazy.

26
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:48,295
Every girl wanted him
to ask her, and he asked me.

27
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,539
I feel like princess Diana...

28
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,615
Would have felt

29
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,945
if prince Charles wasn't
the product of inbreeding.

30
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,698
(Forced laugh)

31
00:00:58,769 --> 00:00:59,731
Huh.

32
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:02,364
Why are you here
right now?

33
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:03,667
Grandma had better
be dead.

34
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:05,016
Grandma's fine, sadly.

35
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:07,420
What is it that you could
possibly be doing?

36
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,308
I'm signing your father and myself up
as chaperones for the dance.

37
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:12,883
Well, then I'm signing up
for the army. Afghanistan.

38
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:15,008
I'm going to be
a minesweeper. Deal?

39
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:16,327
I know this is
horrible for you,

40
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:17,723
but I'm doing it anyway,

41
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:19,460
because your father and I
met at a dance,

42
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,369
and I want to, and I deserve
to get something I want.

43
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:24,572
But I will allow you
to give us three guidelines.

44
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:26,449
No standing near me,
no looking at me,

45
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,310
no dancing, period.

46
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,653
- Even...
- That includes the Weaver running man.

47
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,286
All right. Done.

48
00:01:32,306 --> 00:01:34,093
Although your father
will be disappointed.

49
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:36,326
If you break
any of my rules,

50
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,118
I will make out
with Jeremy so hard,

51
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:40,964
so in front of you,

52
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:43,446
you won't be able to close
your eyes without picturing

53
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:46,363
some guy's hand
groping your daughter's butt.

54
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:48,378
You'll try
to think of the beach,

55
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:50,751
or something happy
so you can sleep.

56
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:52,899
But you won't be able to.

57
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,350
His hands.

58
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:56,200
My butt.

59
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:58,154
All night.

60
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:01,512
I think we'll all
have a great time.

61
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:03,471
Yeah. It should be good.

62
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:04,677
Bye, sunshine.

63
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:06,996
S01E13
Dream Weavers

00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:09,722
Sync by <font color="#ff69b4">ninh</font>
www.addic7ed.com

65
00:02:10,234 --> 00:02:11,408
- Oh.
- Man.

66
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:13,353
Now this is a suit.

67
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:14,854
(Laughs)

68
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:17,473
The cummerbund was
the same blue as your eyes...

69
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:19,242
And my eye shadow.

70
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:21,257
Now you were saying
that high school dances

71
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:23,056
are not just about dancing?

72
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,274
Right. They're kind of
like a love war zone.

73
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:27,517
There's heartbreak,
pursuit, rejection...

74
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:28,985
So much rejection.

75
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:31,246
And at this dance, Marty and I
had the whole shebang.

76
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,511
It was a night
of drama and tears,

77
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:36,008
but in the end,
we realized...

78
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:38,490
- We were soul mates.
- How exhausting.

79
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,063
Why wouldn't you skip
all that first part?

80
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:41,297
Well, sometimes you
have to get it wrong

81
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:42,830
before you get it right,
you know?

82
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,883
Actually, we don't.

83
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:45,560
Zabvronians are
so perfectly in tune

84
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,499
with the universal truth
that we don't get it wrong.

85
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,523
When it is time for two beings
to find each other,

86
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:52,912
we are pulled onto our feet
by an intractable force

87
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:54,789
and the same thing
is happening to our mate,

88
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:56,712
wherever they may be.

89
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:59,690
Hmm. And we are pulled by this
force to a nearby holy space

90
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,412
which you call a love field.

91
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,832
Oh, no. We don't
call anything a love field.

92
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:04,887
- No?
- (Both) No.

93
00:03:04,922 --> 00:03:06,724
Well, anyway,
that's how we meet,

94
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:09,485
and from that moment forward,
we are together

95
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,579
and in harmony for all eternity.

96
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,545
Well, not always
in har...

97
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:14,895
- In harmony for all eternity.
- Sorry.

98
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:17,412
Well, I wonder if
I'd like it being that easy.

99
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:20,284
The whole drama of dating,
the "will-they-won't-they?"

100
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:22,255
That's what high school dances
are all about.

101
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,553
Well,
that and the cool suit.

102
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:24,607
Oh, he still has his.

103
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:26,034
You wanna see it, Larry?
Come on.

104
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:27,617
I honestly just wanted
to bring your newspaper

105
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:30,859
and go ho... oh.
I always get sucked in.

106
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,231
Debbie Weaver,

107
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,716
will you tell me more about how
you met your soul mate Marty?

108
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:39,133
Let's make mimosas
and find the yearbooks, huh?

109
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:41,859
She's pretty fast and loose

110
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,907
- with the excuses for mimosas...
- Shh, shh, shh.

111
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:45,070
Mm.

112
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,987
Oh. This is so great.

113
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:50,112
Greg tansey was my date.

114
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:52,314
Wait.
Marty wasn't your date?

115
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:55,262
No. We went with other people.
That's the story.

116
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:56,600
- Oh.
- So Greg picks me up

117
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,954
in this really cool car
he borrowed from his dad.

118
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:00,676
Totally dreamy.

119
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:03,018
He comes to the door
with the perfect corsage.

120
00:04:03,038 --> 00:04:03,887
Corsage?

121
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:05,609
Oh, it's a flower
you strap to your wrist.

122
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,215
It's what boys
bring girls for dances.

123
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:10,464
A wrist flower?
That sounds preposterous,

124
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,218
- and yet now I really want one.
- Right?

125
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,537
Oh, I was so excited.
But then...

126
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:15,771
He stood you up.
But Marty,

127
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,361
who lived next door
and had much better hair,

128
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:18,954
took you anyway?
(Gasps)

129
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:21,359
No. Greg and I
went to the dance.

130
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,422
But he runs off
to hang with his guy friends,

131
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:24,787
totally leaving me alone.

132
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,054
I was so embarrassed.

133
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:28,711
I burst into tears
and ran outside.

134
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:29,885
I know it's all
going to be fine,

135
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:31,284
but I'm still so nervous
that it won't be.

136
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,972
So I pulled myself together,

137
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:35,784
and I go inside to get myself
a glass of punch.

138
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:37,967
And standing
by the punch bowl is...

139
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,495
Greg tansey's father.
He wanted his car back.

140
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:42,496
No. Marty.

141
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:46,172
He had gone to the dance
with this trashy girl,

142
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:48,250
Lisa Biscotti.

143
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,531
And they were having
a horrible time, too.

144
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:52,468
So he poured me
a glass of punch,

145
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:54,174
had me laughing right away.

146
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,570
I thought we spoke
for five minutes.

147
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,974
It ended up being
almost an hour.

148
00:04:57,994 --> 00:04:59,758
Time flew because you were in love.
(Exhales)

149
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:00,782
Exactly.

150
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:03,561
So we decided to break it off
with our dates,

151
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,846
we met on the dance floor,

152
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,816
he pulled me in close,

153
00:05:08,836 --> 00:05:11,752
and we danced
to "Dream Weaver."

154
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:13,737
Which is your name.

155
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,381
It was perfect, because
your name is in the song.

156
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:18,175
You are getting it now.

157
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,258
Wow.

158
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,673
That's why I want to chaperone
this dance, you know?

159
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:23,612
Sometimes it's nice
to have a reminder

160
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:25,024
of where it all started.

161
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:26,203
I think a high school dance

162
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:28,762
sounds like the most exciting,
romantic place in the world.

163
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,158
Ooh.

164
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:32,553
Let's watch John Hughes movies
about dances

165
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:34,869
and make more mimosas.

166
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:37,940
(Lowered voice)
They're mostly orange juice.

167
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,376
I think she has it
under control. I really do.

168
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,551
(Door closes)

169
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:46,285
Husband, I want
a "will-they-won't-they."

170
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,224
Fine. Order one on Amazon.

171
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:50,504
- You can put it on the credit card.
- No.

172
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:53,658
I want a dramatic story
about how you won me.

173
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:56,028
The way we got together
was so easy.

174
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:56,857
So boring.

175
00:05:56,877 --> 00:05:59,509
Oh, yes.
The universe drew us together

176
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:02,344
through space and time
to a perfect union.

177
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:04,229
What a snooze festival.

178
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,609
I want drama, pursuit.

179
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:07,917
I want you
to chase me.

180
00:06:07,937 --> 00:06:09,982
- What, into the kitchen?
- Metaphorically.

181
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,070
You want me to metaphorically
chase you into the kitchen?

182
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:16,070
I want you to win me
after a twisty, turny story

183
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,683
where it seems like you won't,

184
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:19,390
filled with disappointment
and wrist flowers,

185
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,818
and then,
just when all is lost,

186
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:24,690
a dreamy car.

187
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,947
But I already won you.

188
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,196
- Have you?
- Have I?

189
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:30,786
Oh, that's not
how you do it.

190
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:32,575
I'm going to storm out
dramatically.

191
00:06:32,595 --> 00:06:34,591
Oh, darling,
don't be ridiculous!

192
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:36,377
You're taking me to that dance!

193
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,379
Oh... come on, pumpkin!

194
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:40,831
Ugh. I guess this is
what I'm doing this week.

195
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:46,784
(Man) ? I have a crush on

196
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:49,783
? crush on miss Johnson

197
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:52,730
? I have a crush on

198
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,713
- ? crush on miss Johnson
- Ooh.

199
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:04,038
Hello. I'm Reggie.

200
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:06,282
I noticed you
don't have any friends

201
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:07,891
and might be desperate
for a date.

202
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,233
That's true.
I'm Giselle...

203
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:12,223
- Like the model.
- Great.

204
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:14,597
So I recently learned that the way you find
your soul mate

205
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:16,855
is to go to the dance
with the wrong person,

206
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,848
who you then break up with

207
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:20,521
after you find your soul mate
at the punch bowl.

208
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:22,221
So I was wondering,

209
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,529
would you like to be
my wrong person,

210
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:26,006
the one I will dump?

211
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:28,413
Can we still take pictures
at my parents' house?

212
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:29,195
Sure.

213
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,151
Okay. Awesome.

214
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:32,349
You can meet my turtle.

215
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,335
That's weird, but I'll
pick you up at 8:00.

216
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,861
Okay.

217
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:37,674
(Crickets chirping)

218
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:38,642
(Jangle)

219
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:41,446
Your date has arrived.

220
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:43,864
Oh, honey,
you look beautiful.

221
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:48,266
I even pulled out
the rhinestones.

222
00:07:48,286 --> 00:07:50,370
My neck will be green
by 10:00.

223
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:51,338
(Laughs)

224
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:53,740
Oh, oh. And...

225
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,979
I got you a boutonniere.

226
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:58,456
You got me flowers?

227
00:07:58,476 --> 00:08:00,243
I didn't realize
we were going all out.

228
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:01,707
You want me to wear the suit?
I could...

229
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:03,461
No, you look handsome.

230
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:05,923
Good, 'cause I don't think I can
hold my stomach in all night.

231
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,246
Come here.

232
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:08,449
Mm.

233
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,440
Okay. This whole
touching each other thing,

234
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,963
this is the last of that.

235
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:15,594
- Wow.
- Oh, she's an angel.

236
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:17,472
And thus ends
our talking for the night.

237
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,357
(Car horn honks)
Is Jeremy outside?

238
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:20,744
Bring him in here.
We wanna meet him.

239
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:22,295
- Oh, I need pictures.
- Right.

240
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,493
Well, then you'd better borrow
someone's hubble telescope,

241
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:26,875
because that's as close as
you're going to get to us.

242
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:28,116
- Just one.
- No.

243
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:30,027
- Just one of me and you?
- Not happening.

244
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:31,777
- Marty, Marty, take a picture.
- Almost. Almost.

245
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:33,204
- Okay.
- Now. Now. Now.

246
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:34,855
Now.
(Beeps)

247
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:36,850
Nope. All door.

248
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,513
Ah!

249
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:40,515
Oh, I hope she has fun.

250
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:41,746
I hope it's magical.

251
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:43,481
Well, I hope it's platonic.

252
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,475
And I hope
that Jeremy's a eunuch.

253
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:47,733
Are we picking them up,
or are they gonna meet us here?

254
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:49,804
What? Who them?
What are you talking about?

255
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,945
<i>(Dance music playing)</i>

256
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,511
Guys? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

257
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,845
- Break it up.
- No roughhousing!

258
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,398
Take it to the shower
where it belongs!

259
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:01,782
Go. Go.

260
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,006
(Both laugh)

261
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:05,004
If the boys just wanted
to hang out with each other,

262
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:07,337
why did they
even bring us?

263
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,174
I have no idea.

264
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:10,992
Well, I'm so glad I came.

265
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:13,974
You know what, though, Larry?
Jackie seems a little upset.

266
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:15,669
- You should go talk to her,
- I think.

267
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,366
Oh, no. Don't worry.
I know my wife.

268
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,034
<i>You know what we should do?</i>

269
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:21,291
Let's go outside
where the kids smoke

270
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,620
and watch 'em scatter
like cockroaches.

271
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,922
Oh, Marty Weaver,
you are fun. (Laughs)

272
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:26,888
- You're fun!
- Don't you start with me, big boy.

273
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:28,509
- Oh, you wanna start with me?
- Oh, you wanna start something, do you, big boy?

274
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:29,948
Yeah, I wanna start with you.
I'm gonna start with you.

275
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:32,630
Sometimes it's hard
to stay attracted to them.

276
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,048
So hard.

277
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:55,168
It's interesting...
mondays and wednesdays,

278
00:09:55,188 --> 00:09:56,719
I do upper bod,
Tuesdays and Thursdays,

279
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:58,625
I do lower.
Fridays are cardio.

280
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:02,001
But today, I was doing squats,
when I realized...

281
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,521
It's Friday.

282
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,133
So what'd you do?
(Exhales)

283
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:09,762
Switched to cardio.

284
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:13,154
I can't believe
that he's your date.

285
00:10:13,174 --> 00:10:14,445
She's his date.

286
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:15,500
I should get your number.

287
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,443
I'm gonna start
texting you now.

288
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,266
Oh, my.

289
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:26,214
It really is
quite magical, isn't it?

290
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,462
It's nice.

291
00:10:27,482 --> 00:10:29,758
Sometimes I light candles
and sit in my closet.

292
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:31,175
It's nice, too.

293
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,409
Okay.

294
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:36,593
I'm going to the punch bowl
to wait for my soul mate.

295
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:38,015
Can I stand near you?

296
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,527
Or would you like me
to keep my distance?

297
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:41,969
Giselle...

298
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:44,031
Keep your distance.

299
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:47,558
<i>(Dance music playing)</i>

300
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:49,380
Oh, my God.
That was awesome.

301
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,966
Girls, you missed it. We chased
down these kids with a flask.

302
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:53,925
They tried to get away
by jumping over these bushes,

303
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,377
but they fell in face-first.

304
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:57,250
(Snorts and laughs)
There was blood.

305
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,616
I love chaperoning.

306
00:10:58,636 --> 00:11:00,849
Husband! I want
to be "pretty in pinked,"

307
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,326
and I want it now.

308
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:04,123
You're completely
dropping the ball.

309
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:06,010
Oh, I disagree.
I think I'm doing great.

310
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,268
You didn't even
give me a wrist flower.

311
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:10,551
Why would I kill one
of my flowers for you?

312
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,525
Because you are
trying to get me.

313
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:14,356
But I already have you.

314
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,353
Larry, you should
go after her.

315
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:22,652
Like I said, I know my wife.
Now is not the time.

316
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:25,455
Oh! Below-the-waist
touching on the dance floor!

317
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:27,165
I'll be with you in a sec.

318
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:28,942
Crazy. He's having fun.

319
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:32,270
So, think you could hang with
your date for, like, a minute?

320
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,106
Wait, are you...
you really mad at me?

321
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,721
I thought we were chaperoning.
Is this a date?

322
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:37,448
Well, yeah.

323
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:39,819
I wanted to relive
the night we fell in love.

324
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:41,151
(Chuckles)

325
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:44,750
How about I go see if
the D.J. has "Dream Weaver,"

326
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,020
and then you give
your old man a dance,

327
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,100
because I still have
some funky moves.

328
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,627
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah, you wanna see?

329
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:50,607
- Let's see.
- Wanna see it?

330
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,885
- Remember this one?
- Oh. I like it.

331
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:53,449
You like this, when I
do this with the arms?

332
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:55,372
The attitude?

333
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:57,599
Oh, my God. Stop. Stop.

334
00:11:58,145 --> 00:11:59,454
- Go get me some punch.
- All right.

335
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:01,235
All right, be right back.

336
00:12:04,101 --> 00:12:05,632
Hey, Reggie,
what are you doing?

337
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:06,509
Debbie Weaver told me

338
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:09,006
about how humans meet their
soul mates by the punch bowl.

339
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:09,798
So I'm here.

340
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:12,250
No, buddy, that's just how
Debbie and I got together.

341
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:13,825
That's not everybody's story.

342
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:14,950
Oh.

343
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:19,475
(Sighs)
So I am so confused.

344
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,887
What's my soul mate story?

345
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,741
Buddy, don't let the ladies
get into your head, okay?

346
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:27,504
Stories are just that...
stories.

347
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:29,388
Can I tell you a secret?

348
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:31,229
That dance
that we met at?

349
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:33,384
When I went outside
to break it off with my date,

350
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:37,442
she was very upset,
so I tried to comfort her.

351
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:40,987
And then, you know, one thing
led to another, and...

352
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:44,516
- You get what I'm saying?
- Not if there's subtext.

353
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:47,792
We made out in the library,
up against a bunch of books.

354
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:50,500
I didn't even officially
break up with her.

355
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,198
You know, so then when I got
back, Debbie was there,

356
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:55,980
and, you know,
"Dream Weaver,"

357
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,581
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

358
00:12:57,601 --> 00:13:00,436
So you see,
no one ever really knows

359
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:02,570
how they found
their soul mate.

360
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,933
Or if their marriage
was based on lies!

361
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,470
No, no, honey,
I wasn't saying...

362
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,160
"Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah"?

363
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,641
Ugh! Animal!

364
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:16,196
You didn't see her
standing there?

365
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:19,149
Like, while we were talk...
never saw her?

366
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,979
(Crying)

367
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:30,250
High school dances suck.

368
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,280
Guys suck.

369
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,013
Why don't they
stop doing that?

370
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:35,259
- I don't know.
- We don't do that.

371
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,220
Not as much, no.

372
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:38,672

373
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:39,789
Oh...

374
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:42,673
Here you go, sweetheart.

375
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,131
That's the worst part.

376
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:47,349
Oh, God.

377
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,486
Hey. Why aren't you
dancing with your date...

378
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:00,462
And her turtle?

379
00:14:00,868 --> 00:14:02,648
I don't really
feel like it.

380
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:03,843
Mm.

381
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:05,867
So what's up with you
tonight?

382
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:07,619
You've been lurking
by the punch bowl,

383
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:09,271
and now you're sulking.

384
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,090
Acting a little
moody vampire-y, huh?

385
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,661
Just a little sad
because...

386
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:18,797
I thought tonight
would be the night when...

387
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:21,252
When I told you something.

388
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:23,466
Reggie, I've been
waiting for this.

389
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:25,850
- You have?
- Yeah.

390
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,295
Well, I mean, I didn't know that
aliens could swing that way,

391
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:30,622
but it's so cool
to be gay.

392
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:31,893
(Mutters)
Alien gay.

393
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,576
Totally rock 'n' roll, man.

394
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,946
No. Amber, no.
I am not the gay.

395
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:38,044
I thought tonight would be
the night that you realized

396
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:41,385
that you'd gotten it wrong
with Jeremy the jock...

397
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,517
And that I'm your soul mate.

398
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,854
Oh.

399
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:50,929
Reggie,
I think you're great,

400
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:54,226
but until tonight,
you were my only friend.

401
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,348
And you're probably still
my only real friend.

402
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:01,706
I just don't know if I really
see you that other way.

403
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:06,912
I'm sorry.

404
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:12,757
This is the worst thing
I've ever felt!

405
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:15,938
My stomach is burning!
My heart's aching!

406
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,703
I think I'm gonna die!

407
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:18,757
Oh! My son!

408
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:20,756
What do I do? Is he dying?
(Panting)

409
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,824
How do I fix it?
Does this help?

410
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:24,576
She thought I was gay.

411
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:26,480
- Well...
- Okay, I'm sorry, guys,

412
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,513
but there's not much you can do
to make this go away.

413
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:30,514
But the good news
is you're not dying.

414
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:32,053
It just feels like it.

415
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:34,076
How can humans stand this?

416
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,843
Well, often,
we eat our way through it.

417
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:38,357
Sad songs help.

418
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:40,331
And making out
with drummers.

419
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:42,403
But mostly,
you just need time.

420
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:43,905
That's the big one.

421
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:45,456
I gotta feel like this
for a long time?

422
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:47,565
Yeah. And probably
more than once.

423
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:48,521
What?!

424
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,904
You may think that you
totally found your soul mate.

425
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:53,785
And she doesn't feel
the same way,

426
00:15:53,805 --> 00:15:55,870
but that just means
you weren't soul mates.

427
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,558
- Aah!
- So get back out there,

428
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:59,678
and keep looking,
'cause you will find her.

429
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:03,153
Yes. Like Debbie Weaver
will find her real soul mate.

430
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:05,176
Tonight she suffers
because she has learned

431
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:07,881
it isn't Marty, but she
will get back out there,

432
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,556
and she will find him,
despite her age.

433
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:13,286
No. No.
That's not it at all.

434
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,706
I mean, Marty may have been
a completely revolting

435
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,133
little monster
of a 16-year-old,

436
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:19,528
but he made me laugh
that night instead of cry.

437
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:21,188
And there have been
a million times since

438
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,450
where he has turned
my tears into laughter,

439
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,891
often via
the Weaver running man...

440
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:27,987
Which he doesn't
even know is funny.

441
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:30,507
He doesn't even know it.

442
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:33,935
He is my soul mate.

443
00:16:34,518 --> 00:16:38,626
And that is
the universal truth.

444
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,025
Honey, stop texting him
and move on.

445
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:45,681
There are drummers
in your future. Trust me.

446
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:49,620
Wow. She knows a lot.

447
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,514
Yes, she does.

448
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,111
I think I'm gonna
go back to the dance.

449
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:55,769
Go, my son.

450
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:58,003
I'm so proud of you.

451
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:00,175
And I am going home.

452
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,284
Because my soul mate,

453
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,867

who I am destined

454
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,257

all of eternity with,

Who knows? Maybe my spot
was next to the dance floor,

527
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:12,301
not the punch bowl.

528
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:17,104
<i>?unmeasurable, unchanging all the time ?</i>

529
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:19,499
I love this song!

530
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,608
They used it in "true blood,"
my favorite show.

531
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:23,755
Some people think that I look
like the main vampire guy.

532
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:26,076
Do you think so?
I met him in a mall once.

533
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:28,310
We have the same jaw
and we both squint.

534
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,097
Other people think that I look
like if Matt Damon

535
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:32,070
and Ethan Hawke
had a baby together.

536
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,532
I don't know
about that, though.

537
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:35,977
My auntie June thinks that
I look like Milla Jovovich.

538
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:37,975
What's that supposed to mean?
She's a girl.

539
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:39,787
My grandpa said that
I look like Warren Beatty.

540
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,120
I have no idea...

541
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:05,503
Break it up.

542
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:09,222
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

543
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:11,059
That's the second time!

544
00:21:18,955 --> 00:21:20,235
(Switch clicks)

545
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:23,738
Seriously?

546
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:25,139
Oh, shoot.

547
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:26,491
That's sad.

548
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:27,992
Leave the bra!

549
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:29,963
Oh! Okay! Go! Go!

550
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:32,714
I don't want to see the two
of you in here ever again!

551
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:33,864
Is that clear?

552
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:35,700
Crystal!

553
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:36,593
(Boys laughing)

554
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:38,256
I can hear you.

555
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,545
