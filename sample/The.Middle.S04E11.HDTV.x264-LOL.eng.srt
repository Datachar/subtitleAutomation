(Crow caws)

3
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:06,217
<i>(Frankie) High school</i>
<i>is chock full of land mines.</i>

4
00:00:06,305 --> 00:00:08,002
<i>But Axl had made it through</i>
<i>his four years</i>

5
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,403
<i>pretty much unscathed...</i>

6
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:11,580
<i>until the first day</i>
<i>of the last semester</i>

7
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:13,016
<i>of his senior year.</i>
(School bell rings)

8
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:14,378
- Foster.
(Girl) - Here.

9
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:15,462
Randall?

10
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,376
(Boy) Here.

11
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:17,778
- Heck.
- Here.

12
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:20,521
- Heck.
- Still here.

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,389
Uh, no, it says I have
two Hecks in this class.

14
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:24,605
Well, that must be a typo,

15
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:26,084
'cause there's no other Heck...

16
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:27,317
except...

17
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,205
Sorry I'm late.

18
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:31,376
(Gasps) Axl!

19
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:33,370
I didn't know we were
in the same class.

20
00:00:33,518 --> 00:00:35,001
Oh, my God. (Laughs)

21
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,632
This is my brother.

22
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:38,097
(Laughter)

23
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:39,253
(Door opens)
(Axl) And another thing--

24
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:40,477
why are you always raising your hand...
(Door closes)

25
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:41,815
and asking questions
like a dork?

26
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:42,752
Stare at the clock,

27
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:44,470
and wait for the bell to ring
like a normal person.

28
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,862
Excuse me
if I like to participate.

29
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:47,881
What's going on?

30
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,248
So I was sitting
in my life skills class,

31
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:50,668
minding my own business,

32
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:52,592
when hurricane Sue rolls in,

33
00:00:52,712 --> 00:00:54,595
blowing geek
and raining nerd everywhere!

34
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:55,981
What are you even doing
in that class?

35
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:57,502
It's for freshmen
and sophomores only,

36
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,652
not loser seniors who missed it

37
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:01,575
'cause they were
taking math two times.

38
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:04,583
Ha! It was English I took twice.
Who's the idiot now?

39
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:07,829
Make her drop out.
It's not just me.

40
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:10,062
There's 30 innocent lives
in there she's ruining.

41
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:12,926
Okay, clearly, you two shouldn't
be in the same room... ever.

42
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:14,780
Can't one of you switch
to a different period

43
00:01:14,905 --> 00:01:16,305
or school or something?

44
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:17,601
Look, I'd say
try getting along,

45
00:01:17,764 --> 00:01:19,266
but I'd never
keep a straight face.

46
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,076
Why don't you pretend
you don't know each other?

47
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:23,138
That was my plan, too,
but Sue kept talking to me.

48
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:24,528
You pushed my desk
into the hallway!

49
00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:25,434
You left me no choice!

50
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,196
Enough. The whole reason
we send you to school

51
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:28,278
is so we don't have to
deal with you

52
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:29,899
for seven hours a day.
Now go do your homework.

53
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:31,043
(Axl) I don't have any.
(Sue laughs)

54
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:31,891
Yes, we do.
(Gasps)

55
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,254
See?! That's exactly
what I'm talking about!

56
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,424
Look, like it or not,
life is full of stuff,

57
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,004
and you just have to
roll with it.

58
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:40,370
(Clatter and crash in distance)

59
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:49,341
What was that
we're supposed to do again?

60
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:50,685
When the stuff happens?

61
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:52,491
(Sighs)

62
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,090
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Axl wasn't the only one</i>

63
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,614
<i>with an unwanted guest</i>
<i>in his class.</i>

64
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:05,519
(Children shouting playfully)

65
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:27,302
(Door squeaks)

66
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:28,892
Have you been spying on me?

67
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:30,450
<i>Whoa.</i> Whoa.

68
00:02:30,602 --> 00:02:32,049
(Door closes)
Stop the interrogation.

69
00:02:32,178 --> 00:02:35,021
I'll spill.
Here, have-- have a seat.

70
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:39,658
Hi.

71
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,606
I'm Dr. Fulton,
the school therapist.

72
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,807
Your social skills teacher

73
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:46,999
gave me the heads up
about this guy named Brick.

74
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:48,601
Look, if this is gonna
turn into a whole thing,

75
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,135
I'm gonna need cookies.
The nurse gives you cookies.

76
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:52,841
Can I be straight
with you, Brick?

77
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,590
You don't seem to have
many friends.

78
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:56,853
And I get that.

79
00:02:57,014 --> 00:02:59,532
You know, I didn't have
a girlfriend until I was 30.

80
00:02:59,661 --> 00:03:02,032
(Chuckles) But this is no time
to bring up Shelly.

81
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,716
- Let me cut to the chase.
- Please.

82
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,747
In all my observing,
I don't think I once saw you

83
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:09,357
having a conversation
with another student.

84
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:10,866
Well, I don't know.

85
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,521
I'm pretty sure I said,
"take one and pass it back."

86
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,643
You know, making a connection

87
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:16,823
is not as tough
as you might think.

88
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:18,874
Have you watched
the kids in the hall?

89
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:22,183
They have this whole unspoken
language of communication

90
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,170
that helps them to link up.

91
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,833
Sometimes it can be
something as small

92
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,185
as just, like, a tiny head nod.

93
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,339
They also think it's fine

94
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:31,058
to punch each other
in the privates.

95
00:03:31,188 --> 00:03:34,504
(Laughs) Well, that is
always a classic.

96
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,114
But the good news is,

97
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,646
I think I can teach you
some strategies

98
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,288
that might help you
to score some amigos.

99
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,826
- Are you game for that?
- Do I have a choice?

100
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:46,324
No, you do not.

101
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,915
I think the best way to proceed

102
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:50,164
would be
to schedule our sessions

103
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:52,277
during your library time.

104
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:53,286
What?

105
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:54,771
No, not my library time.

106
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,938
You can't do that.
I know how this works.

107
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,775
You can't do anything
without my parents' permission.

108
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,466
Oh, but, Brick...

109
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:03,716
I already have it.

110
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,288
(Dog barking in distance)

111
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,122
Hello, mother.
Hello, father.

112
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:11,181
So now I need a therapist?
Am I really that weird?

113
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:12,915
Look, you're no weirder
than you've ever been,

114
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:15,298
it's just that suddenly,
the school seems to care.

115
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:17,913
Don't you think that's something
we should talk about?

116
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:19,706
What happened to
"you're growing up, Brick,"

117
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:22,242
"we should include you
in the conversations, Brick"?

118
00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:23,628
It's good for you,
and it's free.

119
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:25,058
You're doing it.

120
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,470
It is free, right?

121
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:31,159
Oh, yeah.
Checked twice.

122
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,302
Good, 'cause I finally
got through

123
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:34,262
to the insurance company.
Apparently they're backed up,

124
00:04:34,402 --> 00:04:35,544
and it's gonna be
at least a week

125
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:36,928
before they can
process our claim.

126
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:39,606
What? A week with no windshield?
(Door closes)

127
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:41,115
This is not
convertible weather, Mike.

128
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:42,580
What are we supposed to do?

129
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:44,797
(Wind blowing)

130
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:48,065
For your first
life skills project,

131
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:49,987
you will be assigned a career.

132
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:52,295
In addition
to a 10-page written paper,

133
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:53,740
you will create a resume

134
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:56,205
and have visual aids
for your presentation.

135
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,844
You will have two weeks
to research

136
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,962
and present your findings
to the class.

137
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:01,927
Remember,
my young professionals,

138
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:04,482
<i>the</i> most important
life skill of all--

139
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:06,370
have fun!

140
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:08,427
We're gonna be doing
this assignment in pairs,

141
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:11,144
so why doesn't everyone
go ahead? Find a partner.

142
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:14,807
(Indistinct conversations)

143
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:21,910
(Axl) And they said
it couldn't be done.

144
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:23,866
Mega-shoelace.
(Camera shutter clicks)

145
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:24,832
So, is there anyone

146
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:26,585
who still doesn't
have a partner?

147
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:29,794
Perfect.
You two are now a team.

148
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:33,996
No!

149
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:35,633
(Thud)

150
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:43,845
Look, Axl,

151
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:46,618
it's no picnic for me
being your partner, either.

152
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:47,875
You don't think
I would have rather

153
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:49,160
been paired up
with Spencer Hegman

154
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:51,328
and his notorious
attention to detail?

155
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,724
I would.
But I got you instead.

156
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:56,305
So let's just try
to make the best of it.

157
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,930
So do you have any ideas
for the paper?

158
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,027
(Mouth full) - No.
- Resume?

159
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,130
Negatory.

160
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:02,485
Food demonstration?

161
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:03,653
Bleh.

162
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:04,728
Oh.

163
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,789
Axl, stop screwing around!

164
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:09,374
Vijal Bawa and Connie Wong
have already started.

165
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:11,066
- I know this for a fact!
- Oh, my God.

166
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:13,079
School Sue is even more annoying
than home Sue.

167
00:06:13,212 --> 00:06:14,711
Would you just relax?
We got two weeks.

168
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:17,051
Come find me in 13 1/2 days.
(Bag rustles)

169
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,482
N-- Axl,

170
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:20,264
you cannot wait
till the night before!

171
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,884
Sure I can. That's what
they want us to do.

172
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:23,682
<i>What?</i>

173
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:24,938
(Turns on TV) It's true, Sue.

174
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,009
Teachers are lazy.

175
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:27,615
They know it only takes
a day to do a project,

176
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:28,921
but if they gave us
assignments every day,

177
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:30,356
they'd have to
grade 'em every day.

178
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:31,731
They don't want it,
we don't want it.

179
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:33,468
It's an unspoken agreement.
Who are you to mess

180
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:34,986
with the American
educational system?

181
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:36,266
We're not number one
in the world for nothing.

182
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:37,442
Suck it, China!

183
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,407
That's why they gotta
make all our stuff for us.

184
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:42,400
(Groans and squeals loudly)

185
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:44,482
Okay, Brick.

186
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:48,565
Here's a little trick
I like to call eye contact.

187
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:50,258
Try using those peepers

188
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:54,624
and really opening yourself up
to the other students, hmm?

189
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:57,603
(Indistinct conversations)

190
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,604
Another thought--
you like books.

191
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:07,046
Why don't you find
some fellow book buddies

192
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,298
and try to connect with them?

193
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:11,798
So, what kind of story
you looking for?

194
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:14,143
Man versus man?
Man versus nature?

195
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:17,216
How about
a nice epistolary novel?

196
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:19,243
(Sighs)

197
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:24,518
One surefire way
of making friends?

198
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:25,976
Finding something
the other kids are into

199
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:28,543
and gettin' on board
with that program.

200
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:32,360
Hey, Brick. Uh...

201
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:36,488
I thought today's assignment
was playing tag.

202
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:37,590
I am.

203
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,956
I've achieved the highest
level of tag. I'm it.

204
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:50,090
You know, I went on
kickinitteenstyle.com

205
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:52,313
and took the "rate your
assignment partner" quiz,

206
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:56,130
and you are a "severe
collaboration limitation."

207
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:59,055
With no due respect, I disagree.
(Paper wad thumps)

208
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:00,590
I thought you might
say something like that,

209
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:02,473
so I also ranked you
on the sibling scale,

210
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:04,526
and guess what?

211
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:06,369
You're a "bummer brother."

212
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:09,044
So... yeah.

213
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,559
(Scoffs) Whatever.
This whole thing is lame.

214
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:12,539
(Thumps)

215
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:13,899
Except kitchen floor hoops,

216
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:16,011
which I just invented,
and is totally awesome.

217
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:19,403
I know you fancy yourself
some kind of rebel, Axl,

218
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:22,316
but sometimes in life, you just
have to follow the rules.

219
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:25,737
<i>I</i> put on sunscreen
an hour before going outside.

220
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,327
I wait till the bus comes to
a complete stop before standing.

221
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:32,391
You don't think I would love
to fill up on bread? I would.

222
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,266
But that's not
how the world works.

223
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,524
The rule of this project

224
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:37,267
is that you and I
take the allotted two weeks

225
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,185
and do it <i>together.</i>

226
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,460
And that's just what
we're gonna do, mister.

227
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:43,924
'Cause a "D" might fly
in Ax Land,

228
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,401
but it doesn't work
in Sue City.

229
00:08:46,532 --> 00:08:49,568
And not the one in Iowa.
The one right here.

230
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:54,014
(Sighs)

231
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:56,590
<i>So Sue was making about</i>
<i>as much progress with Axl</i>

232
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:58,678
<i>as we were</i>
<i>with the insurance company.</i>

233
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:01,382
<i>But I was not gonna drive</i>
<i>around without a windshield.</i>

234
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:04,174
<i>I just needed to be</i>
<i>a little creative.</i>

235
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:05,839
(Wind whistling)

236
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:08,426
(Squeaks)

237
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:12,084
(Squeaks, snaps)

238
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,891
(Wind howling)

239
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,752
(Ripping)

240
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:27,050
So I <i>don't</i> want to be it?

241
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:28,088
Right.

242
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:29,546
But doesn't <i>it</i>
have all the power?

243
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:31,565
If you're it,
you have to chase people.

244
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:35,081
Who says? If I'm it,
don't I make all the decisions?

245
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:36,684
(Whispers) It.

246
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:39,300
(Slurps) Okay. I'm calling it on boredom.
(Sets down can)

247
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:40,667
- Night.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

248
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,843
Not so fast. It's your turn
to do the dishes.

249
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:44,882
<i>Oh.</i> Right.

250
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:47,499
Oh, wish I could, but I can't.

251
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,718
Got a really big project
tomorrow,

252
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,341
so I'm just gonna go watch
a few hours of TV

253
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,855
to get the brain fired up
and then get started.

254
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:54,269
Don't bother.
It's already done

255
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,280
and tied up and stuffed
in a bag by the door.

256
00:09:56,449 --> 00:09:59,292
As should <i>you</i> be
for your lackluster effort.

257
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,440
Wait. Wasn't this project
both of yours?

258
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:03,362
- Yes.
- Yes.

259
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:06,110
But I guess she went ahead
and did it without me.

260
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,410
Can you believe this?

261
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:08,710
I was so looking forward
to learning,

262
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:10,667
and she robbed me of that.
She's so selfish.

263
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:12,610
Guess that frees you up
to do the dishes, then.

264
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:14,852
Unless...
Tag. You're it. (Laughs)

265
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:16,368
See, Brick?
That's how it works.

266
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:18,146
- Wait, Axl, we still need to decide...
- I'm not gonna do the dishes for you.

267
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:19,541
...who's saying what when!

268
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:21,205
(Brick) You can't
pawn stuff off on me...

269
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:23,102
Brr!
I cannot get warm.

270
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:24,586
Seriously, I've been
in the house for hours.

271
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:26,850
I'm still freezing.
Feel my face.

272
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:28,839
H-hey!
Get your cold nose off me.

273
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,691
(Sighs) It's not my fault.

274
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:32,601
People need windshields.

275
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,630
Well, you may get one
soon enough.

276
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,525
Here's the check
from the insurance company.

277
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:38,662
(Click)

278
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:39,902
Hang on.

279
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:41,520
They're denying our claim?

280
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,027
<i>What?</i> Wh--

281
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,012
let me see that.

282
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:49,954
Where's the money?
There's no check in here.

283
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,836
Not putting a check
in the envelope is our trick.

284
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:53,336
I don't want it done to me.

285
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,256
We're denied 'cause of
code 426E.

286
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:58,066
What's 426E?
(Dog barking in distance)

287
00:10:58,253 --> 00:10:59,623
"Act of God."

288
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,359
We <i>have</i> act of God.

289
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:03,169
We have
the comprehensive policy.

290
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:05,088
Remember? You thought
it was too expensive,

291
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:06,957
and I said the only
other safety net we have

292
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:09,219
is the Hoosier Lotto,
so we ended up getting it.

293
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:10,179
You know what?

294
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:12,273
I know those receipts
are around here somewhere.

295
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,295
'Cause we paid those premiums.

296
00:11:14,415 --> 00:11:16,680
I remember, because
we were a little late,

297
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:19,108
and the guy was really nice
about taking it.

298
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:20,706
Yeah, they're real nice
about taking your money,

299
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:22,499
it's giving it back
they have a problem with.

300
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:23,848
Well, we are going down there,

301
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:25,221
and we're bringing our car

302
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,338
so that they can see what they've done to us.
(Papers rustling)

303
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,480
I am not taking this lying down.
(Thud)

304
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:33,936
Had a thought, Brick.

305
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:36,236
I've been sending you
out to talk to other kids

306
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:38,642
with nothing in your toolbox.

307
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,187
And that was my bad.

308
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:41,905
So I've taken the liberty
of scripting up

309
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:43,806
a little practice conversation

310
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:47,310
that I think might just
get the old ball rolling, huh?

311
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,327
"Hey."

312
00:11:50,696 --> 00:11:51,984
"What's up, dude?"

313
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:54,514
"Oh, you know.
Just chillin'."

314
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,140
"That's cool."

315
00:11:56,739 --> 00:11:58,876
"Hey, man, I like your style.

316
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:00,970
You seem like a cool guy."

317
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,582
"You seem cool, too.

318
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:06,495
And hey. I totally appreciate
the eye contact, buddy."

319
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,942
"Thanks. Maybe we could
hang out sometime.

320
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:10,892
What do you say, bro?"

321
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:12,709
I really don't think
I would say "bro."

322
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:14,551
Oh. Oh, okay.
Well, that's no big.

323
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,632
We'll just, uh, change that...

324
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:20,753
to "ace," hmm?

325
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:22,402
Can I ask you a question?

326
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,005
Why do I need to make friends
with kids, anyway?

327
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:26,601
I mean-- I mean,
what's the point?

328
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:28,414
They're not interested
in what I have to say,

329
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,871
and I'm certainly not interested
in their conversations.

330
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:32,532
You've seen them in the halls.

331
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,146
They shove, they kick.

332
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,856
They take delight
in screaming for no reason.

333
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,594
If somebody farts,
it's the highlight of their day.

334
00:12:39,737 --> 00:12:41,052
They chase each other around

335
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:43,484
so that way, they may in turn
be chased themselves.

336
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,231
I still don't understand
that one.

337
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:48,491
Well, y-yeah, Brick,
but... everyone needs friends.

338
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,703
Well, I do have friends--

339
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:51,644
the librarian,
the crossing guard,

340
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:52,882
you.

341
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,054
Oh.

342
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,190
Oh, well, thank you, Brick.

343
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:59,620
That-- oh. (Chuckles)
That gets me right here.

344
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:02,171
But I really mean
friends your own age.

345
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:03,714
But if you look at
the entirety of my life,

346
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,312
won't I actually be
spending more time

347
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,241
with adults than kids, anyway?

348
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,193
Sure, but--

349
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,339
Think about it.

350
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,913
If the whole point of this
is to prepare me

351
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:13,634
to be able to make connections
with adults later in my life,

352
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,964
aren't I actually ahead of
the other kids in that regard?

353
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,640
Uh, I-in <i>theory...</i>

354
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:20,850
So... why is it so important
for me

355
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,585
to make friends with kids?

356
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,139
Mr. Flurry! Rocking the gray...

357
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:29,301
(Slaps) as usual.

358
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:32,005
Thanks, Axl.
Great game the other day. (Snaps)

359
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:33,414
(Chuckles)

360
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:34,918
Axl! Where have you been?

361
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:36,397
Have you even gone over
the note cards?

362
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:38,810
We are presenting
first today. <i>First!</i>

363
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:39,879
Calm it down, school Sue.

364
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:40,945
I'll practice
during the announcements.

365
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,102
It's the Axl method.

366
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:44,013
No, that is
the failing-the-class method.

367
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:46,216
Just stick to the note cards
and follow my lead.

368
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:48,751
No improvising.
Let me get you your apron.

369
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,076
Oh, no.

370
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:53,282
Oh, no!

371
00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:55,716
- Oh, <i>no!</i>
- What?

372
00:13:55,912 --> 00:13:57,179
I grabbed the wrong bag.

373
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,429
This is your stupid stuff!
Oh! (Board thuds)

374
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:01,772
Oh, my God.

375
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:03,789
Oh, my God. We're dead!

376
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:06,182
Everything was in there--
the paper, the resume,

377
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,437
the note cards, the menus,
the aprons.

378
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,800
(Gasps) The note reminding me
to get the food for the class

379
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:11,914
out of the fridge.

380
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:13,502
I gave you one job to do...

381
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:16,529
You gave me <i>every job!</i>

382
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:18,655
(School bell rings) Okay.

383
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,076
Okay.

384
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:21,864
That's it.

385
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:23,846
We're gonna get an "F."

386
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:25,426
I'm the kid who gets F's now.

387
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:26,659
That's who I am.

388
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,634
Maybe I'll just get a tattoo.

389
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:30,256
That's it?
You're just gonna give up?

390
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,394
Oh, my God.
What is your problem?

391
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:32,804
It's not even due yet.
We got, like, five minutes.

392
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:33,938
We can do this.

393
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:36,604
Hey. Steve.

394
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,022
(Laughs) What's up?

395
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:39,279
What up, Ax?

396
00:14:39,408 --> 00:14:40,774
Not much. Hey, remember
that time at the lake

397
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:42,544
I introduced you
to Lindsay Sullivan?

398
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:43,546
How's that going?

399
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:44,874
Dude, she's my girlfriend now.

400
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:45,959
I owe you one.

401
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:48,432
Yeah. You do.
And don't forget that.

402
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:50,413
Okay. (Chuckles nervously)

403
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:52,209
(Door opens)

404
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:54,225
(School bell rings)

405
00:14:56,718 --> 00:14:57,857
(Woman) All right.

406
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,547
(Keypad clicking)
"Hey, Michelle. Need a favor."

407
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:03,364
Okay. I'm looking forward

408
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,971
to hearing
everyone's presentations.

409
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:07,568
We don't have a lot of time,
so let's get started.

410
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:09,812
Let's see-- Sue Heck
signed up to go first?

411
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:11,164
<i>(Tone sounds over PA, click)</i>

412
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:12,379
<i>(Girl) Hi. This is Michelle</i>

413
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,622
<i>with your morning</i>
<i>announcements.</i>

414
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:16,503
<i>But first, will Axl Heck</i>
<i>please report to the office?</i>

415
00:15:16,678 --> 00:15:18,781
Well, Axl, we had
a presentation ordered,

416
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:21,253
but if you can find someone
who'd be willing...

417
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,004
Uh, right here.
I'll switch.

418
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:25,103
Okay. Steve,
you and your partner go first,

419
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,874
Axl, you can go to the office,
but make it quick.

420
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,496
<i>The class</i>
<i>was called life skills,</i>

421
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:34,437
<i>and Axl sure put his</i>
<i>to good use.</i>

422
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,686
Hey, Erica.
Look at you making posters.

423
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,554
- You're crazy good.
- Thanks.

424
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:39,687
Know what I could use?

425
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:40,918
One of these, about...
(Exhales)

426
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:43,476
Alan Hung!
What's up, buddy?

427
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,211
You can, like, hack into
people's computers, right?

428
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,898
'Cause there's this paper
on my sister's computer,

429
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:49,095
the password
is "I heart trying."

430
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,815
(Boy) So, you see,
there are many aspects

431
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:53,314
to a dry cleaning business--
tagging, treatment,

432
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:55,673
pressing, tailoring,
collection, and...

433
00:15:55,781 --> 00:15:58,209
Beth. That's business class,
isn't it?

434
00:15:58,327 --> 00:15:59,518
Yeah. It's so boring.

435
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:01,601
I bet. Know what could
be fun for you?

436
00:16:02,857 --> 00:16:04,115
Hey, Bernice.

437
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:05,786
Nice work
on the tater tots yesterday.

438
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:07,089
Can I help you with this?

439
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:08,565
(Bag rustles) I need a favor.

440
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,963
(Playing scales)

441
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:20,261
Okay, it's time
for our final presentation.

442
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,365
Nope. Nope. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

443
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:25,366
Where you going,
Mr. Heck?

444
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:26,243
What's all this?

445
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:27,550
Hey, Principal Cameron.

446
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:29,293
I'm actually on my way
to my life skills presentation,

447
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:31,245
and I'm sorta late, so...

448
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,676
I see. Well, do you
<i>sorta</i> have a hall pass?

449
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:36,491
'Cause if not, you're gonna
<i>sorta</i> need to roll that cart

450
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,553
all the way down to detention.

451
00:16:38,672 --> 00:16:39,886
Uh...

452
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:41,242
Oh.

453
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,884
Here it is.

454
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:44,203
Must have been
in my back pocket.

455
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:46,189
You know, you might want
to turn those into badges,

456
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:49,251
so you can clip them
right here, or here.

457
00:16:50,235 --> 00:16:51,341
All right. Get to class.

458
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:54,573
Uh...
I like the badge idea.

459
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:56,236
You're sharper than you look.

460
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,221
Yes.

461
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,008
Sue, where's Axl?

462
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:02,630
(Door opens)

463
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:04,364
Ladies and gentlemen,

464
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,012
The Ax is back.

465
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,461
(Laughs)

466
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,147
Hey!

467
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:14,171
Oh, Sue.
Dropped her resume. Silly.

468
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,557
That would have been a mess.

469
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:17,027
All right, Sue.

470
00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:19,671
Okay. And do you
have your report?

471
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,221
Of course.

472
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:23,190
And it's ten pages?

473
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:25,213
Actually 11.
Hope that's okay.

474
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,631
(Laughs)

475
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,703
Hello. This is Sue,
my name is Axl,

476
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,831
and we will be
your chefs today.

477
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:43,879
(Gasps) (Students) Ooh!

478
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,193
Mmm.

479
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:49,168
(Playing Italian music)

480
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,192
Imagine yourselves
in an Italian restaurant.

481
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,907
How do you think something
like this comes together?

482
00:17:57,115 --> 00:17:58,759
I don't <i>know!</i>

483
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:01,202
Thank you, Sue, for expressing
what we're all thinking.

484
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:03,032
♪

485
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:11,091
So we have paid our premiums,

486
00:18:11,286 --> 00:18:13,956
on time.
We are organized people.

487
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:16,600
Just bear with me.
I have it right here.

488
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,767
Whoops-- that's a warranty
for the popcorn popper.

489
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:21,404
(Laughs) And this is the record

490
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:23,556
for Brick's
chicken pox vaccine.

491
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:24,924
Sorry.

492
00:18:25,195 --> 00:18:26,912
Takeout menu.

493
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,930
Oh. Another
chicken pox vaccine.

494
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,082
This one's Brick, too.

495
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:35,359
Oh, so Sue's the one that hasn't
been vaccinated. Huh.

496
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:37,613
Actually, I just pulled up
your file.

497
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:41,441
Yep. You are paid up
and covered for acts of God.

498
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:44,953
See? Thank you. So do we get
the check from you,

499
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:48,383
or, uh, maybe from that other
cubby over there by the coffee?

500
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:50,322
And are those doughnuts
for everybody?

501
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:51,675
Hold on now.

502
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,686
Looks like the incident
of January 10th

503
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:56,653
is <i>not</i> covered
under acts of God.

504
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,769
(Both) What?

505
00:18:57,877 --> 00:18:59,828
A tree branch
fell down on our car.

506
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,059
How is that not an act of God?

507
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,940
Tree-- made by God,

508
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:05,712
blown down by the wind--
more God.

509
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:07,231
That's actually
double act of God.

510
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,656
We should be
getting two checks.

511
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:10,565
Well, according
to the inspection,

512
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,688
your tree
wasn't trimmed properly.

513
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,763
Did you ever have it looked at
by a certified arborist?

514
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,068
Oh, I'm sorry.

515
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:20,061
We're in between
arborists right now.

516
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:21,640
What are you talking about?

517
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:22,690
Here's the deal--

518
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:24,159
unless you trimmed
your tree branches

519
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:26,817
to the acceptable length,
it's negligence.

520
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,913
And how are we supposed to know
what the acceptable length is?

521
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:30,608
I'm just gonna guess here,

522
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:32,968
but I'm thinking
it's the length of a branch

523
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:34,661
that when the wind blows,

524
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:36,765
doesn't fall down on your car.

525
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:37,967
(Sighs)

526
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,931
Look, we know an act of God
when we see one, okay?

527
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:43,798
We've had rain
from our ceiling.

528
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,595
We've had floods
from our dishwasher.

529
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:48,674
We've had bedbugs,
tornadoes, black mold,

530
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:51,322
red ants, a frog infestation!

531
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:52,242
Yeah. Frogs.

532
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:53,885
It's the end of days
at our house.

533
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,336
I am not kidding you!

534
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:56,913
Look, in other people's cases,

535
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:58,633
God works in mysterious ways,

536
00:19:58,767 --> 00:19:59,869
but not in ours.

537
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,640
With us,
he's pretty straightforward.

538
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:04,039
And we are not people
who ask for a lot.

539
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:07,730
But we <i>are</i> people who demand
what is ours and what is right,

540
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:09,235
and if you
cannot get with that,

541
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:11,203
then maybe you need
to get your supervisor,

542
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,822
because I don't think
that you want

543
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:17,364
good, paying customers like us
driving away angry.

544
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,298
(Wind whistling) I'm so angry.

545
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:23,372
Brick, you asked me why

546
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:25,483
you have to be friends
with other kids, all right?

547
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,888
And I ran it through
the old think tank,

548
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,196
and here's what I came up with.

549
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:33,549
I have no idea.

550
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,416
But I'm gonna be
applying for a job

551
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:37,256
cutting keys
down at the hardware store

552
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:38,940
if you don't show
some signs of improvement,

553
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:41,854
so I'm just asking you
as a friend... (Sighs)

554
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,001
Can you help me out?

555
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,577
Can you-- can--
can you do me a solid?

556
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:49,553
Can we move our sessions
so I don't miss library time,

557
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,547
but I do miss gym?

558
00:20:52,057 --> 00:20:53,235
Done.

559
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,356
<i>So how do we get life skills?</i>

560
00:20:56,935 --> 00:20:58,609
<i>Sometimes you learn 'em.</i>

561
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:05,962
<i>Sometimes you're born</i>
<i>with 'em...</i>

562
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:10,595
<i>and sometimes</i>
<i>you just have to rely</i>

563
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,134
<i>on an act of God.</i>

564
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:13,089
Hi.

565
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:15,619
We heard you were having
a little trouble with your car

566
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:18,365
and hope you'll feel free
to use the church van

567
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:19,909
for the next few weeks.

568
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:20,771
Aw.

569
00:21:20,874 --> 00:21:23,859
But we will need you
to drive the saintly seniors

570
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,899
to the beauty shop
on Wednesday.

571
00:21:26,294 --> 00:21:27,743
(Keys jingle)

572
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:31,320
Hey. It's got a windshield.

573
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:45,341
