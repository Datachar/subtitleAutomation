We need to raise

Oh, my God. We need to suspend
the stock exchange.

51

I don't know anything.

52

I'm not... I'm not keeping
anything from you.

53

I just...

54
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,508
They're not
telling us anything.

55

- Is the President alive?
- Edison.

56
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:16,012
I'm sorry. It's just...
There's a lot of fear out here.

57
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:17,697
- I have armed escorts.
- They're putting you in the bunker.

58

Along with
the speaker of the house

59

and the entire cabinet.
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:24,437
You know I don't have a choice.
I have to go to the bunker,

61
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:27,190
or else I'd... I'd be there
with you, Liv.

62
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:28,808
I know how hard this must be
for you.

I bought it at auction.

68
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:46,610
President Eisenhower wore it
when he was in office.

69
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:48,695
There are
only 48 stars on it.

70
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:50,230
It's very rare.

71
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:52,249
- You didn't have to.
- I know.

72
00:02:52,283 --> 00:02:53,500
It's your inauguration day.

73
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:55,919
I wanted to give you
something special.

74
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:57,337
You are
my something special.

75
00:02:57,371 --> 00:03:00,841
(Chuckles) We said we'd stop
when you were President.

76
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,726
Well, I'm not President
for another...

77
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:06,578
- 23 minutes.
- Mm.

78
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:10,834
Liv. I didn't know
you were here already.

79
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:12,302
I just got here.

80
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:14,504
(Laughs)
Oh, isn't this the best day?

81
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:16,473
Can you believe
this is happening?

82
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:18,174
I read a biography
on Dolley Madison

83
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:19,809
when I was 10
that I loved,

84
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:22,095
and now I live in her house,
do her job.

85
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:24,814
Ooh, Fitz, that's a nice pin.
Where'd you get it?

86
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:27,100
It was Eisenhower's.

87
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:29,185
Well, that's just...
(Chuckles)

88
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:30,487
That is fantastic.

89

Eisenhower's pin.

90
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:34,941
The press is gonna love it.
Right, Liv?

91
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:36,143
- Right.
- Oh.

I have all the speeches

Do you want to keep them handy,
or should I archive them?

114

Did you bring dresses?

115
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:29,129
- I'm sorry?
- For the inaugural balls tonight.

116
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:30,513
You brought dresses, right?

117
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:33,850
Uh, yes. But you're our boss,
and you're working,

118
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:35,635
- so it's...
- Go.

119

Go and put on your gowns
and have fun.

120

That's an order.

I am traditional.

I am not interested

secret. I am your boyfriend!

00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:41,948
We decided we have to stop.

181
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:45,952
I spent
the whole night dancing,

182
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:49,439
but never with the one person
I actually wanted to dance with.

183
00:07:57,765 --> 00:08:00,267
(Breathing heavily)

184
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:13,779
Mm. Stop.

185
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:15,097
No.
(Clatter)

186
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:16,381
Stop. Stop.
No.

187
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,917
Stop, Fitz. Fitz.

188
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:20,185
Whew!
(Exhales)

189
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:25,524
We can't stop.

190
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:27,609
I can't.

191
00:08:28,244 --> 00:08:31,713
You're the most important
person in my life.

192
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,384
I can't just stop.

193
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:40,071
Can you?

194
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:16,091
(Panting)

195
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:38,930

♪

198
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,660
The video we're showing
you here suggests

199
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,595
that Grant sustained either
three or four bullet wounds.

200
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,098
The doctors at
James Madison hospital

201
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,917
have yet to release any specific
information about his condition,

202
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:05,503
although we believe he is in surgery.
<i>(Crowd screaming and shouting)</i>

203
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:07,305
The White House has to be,

204
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,024
uh, I mean, it's not surprising
that they're remaining silent.

205
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:12,343
The person making a statement
for the White House

206
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:13,994
would normally be
the press secretary,

207
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,312
but as I told you earlier...

208

Press secretary Britta Kagen

was one of those seriously injured...

No word yet on her condition.

212
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,105
The magnitude
of what's going on...

213
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,925
We can forgive them a moment
of chaos within this crisis.

214
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:31,077
Of course,
there are protocols in place,

215

the first being that
priority one for the country

216
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:35,732
is securing the Vice President.

217
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:36,983

218
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:39,769
on the location of Vice
President Sally Langston?

219
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:41,888
We're going directly to the
Naval Observatory, ma'am.

220
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:43,606
We're going to the South lawn
of the White House.

221
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:45,658
We have strict orders to
escort you to the observatory.

222
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:47,227
The pilot's a marine, correct?

223
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:48,394
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,263
I am the acting
commander in chief.

225
00:10:50,297 --> 00:10:52,182
He is following my orders,

(Mutes TV)

235
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:23,578
- Liv will call if she needs us.
- Maybe she's wounded.

236
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:25,314
Maybe that's why we
haven't heard from her.

237
00:11:25,347 --> 00:11:26,447
Did the news say she was wounded?

238
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:27,833
- No.
- Then she's not wounded.

239
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:30,652
(Harrison) - This is out of control.
- Did that just happen?

240
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:31,986
Did she actually just land

241
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,222
on the South lawn
of the White House?

242
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:35,423
Where is she?
Is she in the oval?

243
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:37,058
If she's in the oval...

00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:41,746

246
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:42,881
No!
You're not!

247
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:44,399
Why?
Because...

248
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,034
I want the senior
communications staff gathered

249
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:48,702
and ready to brief me
in 20 minutes.

250
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,004
- You...
- Jeannine.

251
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:51,555
Hi, Jeannine.
Go to my apartment.

252
00:11:51,606 --> 00:11:53,223
(Keys jangle) Secret
service has the address.

253
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,409
Get me one gray suit,
one blue suit,

254
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:57,144
one black suit, six blouses,

255
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:58,929
three pairs of shoes,
some underwear,

256
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:00,798
and my toothbrush.
Bring them to me here.

257
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:01,882
Ms. Pope.

258
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,450
Yes?

259
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:04,818
Does this mean...

260
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:05,903
Are you...

261
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:08,021
Back?
Yes.

262
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,341
I'm back for as long
as you need me.

263
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:13,844
Everything <i>really</i> is
going to be okay.

264
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:16,696
Do you know who lands
on the South lawn?

265
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,864
Cyrus, you are way out of...

266
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:19,732
The <i>President</i>
of the United States.

267
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:22,285
The man has
a bullet in his head.

268
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:24,320
The country needs leadership.

269
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:26,072
- The world needs leadership.
- He may have a bullet in his head,

270
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:27,540
but it's still his lawn, Sally.

271
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:28,724
I am in charge now, and...

272
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:30,226
No! You're not in charge!

273
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,677
Have you read
the whole constitution,

274
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:33,763
or did you stop in rapture
after the second amendment?

275
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:36,115
I have had quite enough of this.

276
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,384
Allow me to summarize
the 25th amendment for you.

277
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:39,902
In the case of the removal
of the President from office

278
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:41,871
or of his death
or resignation,

279
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:44,390
the Vice President
shall become President.

280
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:45,808
Since none of these things
have happened,

281
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,843
the only way
you're President

282
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:51,980
is if the President <i>himself</i>
signs power over to you,

283
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:54,599
or you gather the
signatures of the cabinet.

284
00:12:54,634 --> 00:12:56,601
And that may have all been
a little confusing to you,

285
00:12:56,636 --> 00:12:57,986
so let me summarize further

286
00:12:58,037 --> 00:13:00,155
and tell you simply
that if the President dies,

287
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:01,506
I'll call you.

288
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,974
Until then, these men

289
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:05,944
are going to take you to a
secure, undisclosed location.

290
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:07,129
The hell they are.
I'm not going anywhere.

291
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,297
By being where you are
not supposed to be,

292
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:12,484
you are threatening the
security of this great nation.

293
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:13,919
These men are under orders

294
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:15,420
from the Department
of Homeland Security

295
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:16,972
and the Secretary of Defense

296
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:19,324
to take you
to a secure location.

297
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:21,476
Now you can walk out,
or they can carry you out.

298
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:24,645
And it makes no difference
to them, because guess what...

299
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,698
They serve at the pleasure
of the President,

300
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:28,266
and you...

301
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:30,435
Are not the President.

302
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:32,253
For the record...

303
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:34,888
(Kisses) The honor and privilege
of being here,

304
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:37,541
standing on such hallowed
ground, helping our President

305
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:39,493
set his agenda
for his first hundred days...

306
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,861
It never leaves me.

307
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:42,413
I'm so grateful,
madam Vice President,

308
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,748
because I'm gonna need your help
selling some big ideas.

309
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,367
I'm looking forward to it.

310
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:49,219
And I understand that part
of the first hundred days

311
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:51,505
will now be nominating
a supreme court justice.

312
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,941
That would be correct.

313
00:13:53,975 --> 00:13:55,826
Who knew this chance
would come so quickly?

314
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:58,612
I know. It's so exciting.
I'll be giving you my names

315
00:13:58,663 --> 00:13:59,746
by the end of the week.

316
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,114
Names?

317
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:02,699
That was the deal when Sally
signed on to our campaign.

318
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:04,568
I promised her first crack
at nominating a justice

319
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:05,952
if a vacancy occurred.

320
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,190
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

321
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,509
Thought perhaps you'd like to be
briefed on a few things, sir.

322
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:15,061
I am not a runner.
I hate running.

323
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:18,598
I'm only running so the leader
of China or Pakistan or whatever

324
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,716
can see photos of me running

325
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,150
and decide I'm too badass to pop.

326
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:22,919
I thought you might want to know
where the cameras are, sir.

327
00:14:22,953 --> 00:14:24,754
Cameras?

328
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:28,091
The surveillance cameras...
(Panting) In the White House.

329
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:29,743
There are cameras?

330
00:14:29,794 --> 00:14:31,227
Every morning, an agent reviews
the footage from those cameras

331
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,680
and either erases or archives
that video depending on...

332
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:35,315
- What you see?
- Yes, sir.

333
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:38,567
And I take it there's a camera
in the oval office.

334
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:39,885
- Yes, sir.
- And you reviewed

335
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,503
the footage the morning
after the inaugural ball.

336
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:43,255
I have not seen anything
worth archiving, sir,

337
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,308
not on my shift. But it won't
always be on my shift.

338
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,543
You understand, sir?

339
00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:50,645
(Birds chirping)

340
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,764
What are my options?

341
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:53,949
Sir?

342
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:55,650
You just told me there are
surveillance cameras

343
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:56,868
all over the White House.

344
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:59,588
I'm asking where
aren't there cameras?

345
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:01,506
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

346
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,809
The state of the union
address is about the future.

347
00:15:03,843 --> 00:15:06,111
It should be a showcase
of everything you believe.

348
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:07,779
A comprehensive, nonpunitive
immigration policy

349
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:09,281
<i>is</i> something I believe in.

350
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:10,899
That can't be your highlight.
It's not strong enough to...

351
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:12,400
It's what we ran on.

352
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:16,138
Immigration is noble,
but it doesn't light a fire.

353
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:17,472
If you can't see...

354
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:20,459
(Laughing)

355
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,294
We can't touch defense
or social issues.

356
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:24,529
It might upset the base.
I'm just saying.

357
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:26,548
And I'm saying
we need to be bold,

358
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:29,216
look forward, make a statement
with lasting impact.

359
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:31,402
(Grunts and pants)
Immigration policy

360
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:34,355
will get us a generation
of voters, maybe two.

361
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:35,389
(Grunts)

362
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:38,742
Fitz, stop running
for President

363
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:41,128
and start <i>being</i> President.

364
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:42,696
(Moans)

365
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:43,948
(Laughs)

366
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:46,950
Youth is the future.
Youth is the next generation.

367
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:48,802
You get young people involved
in volunteering.

368
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:50,420
You give them a stake
in the country's future...

369
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:51,738
And a credit
towards college tuition,

370
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:53,407
<i>and</i> you announce it
at the state of the union,

371
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:55,892
and any member of congress who
doesn't stand and applaud you

372
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:57,744
loses every parent
in their constituency.

373
00:15:57,762 --> 00:16:00,330
That is...

374
00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:01,681
That's gold.

375
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:07,137
What is that smell?

376
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:08,572
Fresh air,

377
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:09,656
sunshine,

378
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,475
the great outdoors.

379
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:14,711
Fresh air makes me
very nervous.

380
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:16,780
I'm an indoor person.

381
00:16:16,814 --> 00:16:21,601
That's what the person
I was dating says.

382
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:22,735
<i>Said.</i>

383
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,504
(Birds chirping)

384
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,090
You should call James.

385
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:29,425
I bet he misses you.

386
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,765
Worst-kept secret
in Washington.

387
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:40,936
(Exhales deeply)

388
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,921
I am a leader
of the republican party.

389
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:44,489
It's complicated.

390
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:47,909
It's not. You want to be
with the man you love.

391
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,811
Be with him.

392
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:51,746
I'm an indoor person,
Liv.

393
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:56,368
(Knock on door)

394
00:16:58,354 --> 00:16:59,988
Mellie, what are you...
(Laughs)

395
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:01,890
Surprise! (Laughs)

396
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,674
Honestly, I had to come.

397
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:05,343
The kids just left to go back
to boarding school,

398
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:07,478
and I'm not used to being all
alone in the White House yet,

399
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:09,647
so I just thought,
why not come up here,

400
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:12,051
see how the state of the union
speech is going?

401
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:13,385
It's going great.

402
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:15,670
Yeah, I told Mellie our sessions
have been very productive.

403
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:16,488
Yes.

404
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,523
Well, I would love to hear
all about it over dinner,

405
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,741
which is why
I'm at your door.

406
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:22,410
Fitz said you wouldn't want
to have dinner,

407
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:23,911
but I said,
of course you would.

408
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:25,913
Of course.

409
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,020
In a few moments, we're gonna
take you live to the White House

410
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:42,622
where former White House
communications director

411
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:45,007
Olivia Pope
will hold a briefing.

412
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:46,842
Pope, of course, was
part of the storied team

413
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:48,511
that ran President Grant's
election campaign.

414
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,079
When she left
the administration,

415
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:52,314
it was a move
that surprised many.

416
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:54,883
The choice to hand the podium
to Pope is unusual,

417
00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:57,102
but I am told that there's been
a lot of chatter of support

418
00:17:57,136 --> 00:17:59,204
<i>for Pope's display of patriotism...</i>
(Camera shutters clicking)

419
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:02,408
<i>In stepping up at this time</i>
<i>of extraordinary crisis.</i>

420
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:04,726
President Grant is in surgery.

421
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:06,395
His condition is described
as critical,

422
00:18:06,446 --> 00:18:07,779
as is the press secretary.

423
00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:10,165
The first lady was unharmed.

424
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:12,050
Any further updates
about the medical condition

425
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:13,936
of the President
and press secretary Britta Kagen

426
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:16,154
will come from the chief
of surgery at the hospital,

427
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:17,706
not from this podium.

428
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:19,891
Specific questions
about the attack

429
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,893
are being handled by the FBI.
Ashley.

430
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:23,895
Is the Vice President
acting as President?

431
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:25,663
The President is
still the President.

432
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:27,081
There are reports the first lady
is being treated for...

433
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:28,399
The first lady is
not being treated.

434
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:29,734
Why haven't we seen her then?

435
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:31,319
The first lady is staying
at the President's side.

436
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:32,704
She was not harmed.

437
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:34,972
The Vice President just landed
on the South lawn.

438
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:36,574
Why isn't she briefing us
instead of you?

439
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:38,109
<i>The Vice President</i>
<i>isn't briefing you</i>

440
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:39,527
<i>because</i>
<i>our national security protocols</i>

441
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:41,763
<i>demand that her safety</i>
<i>be secured above all.</i>

442
00:18:41,897 --> 00:18:43,814
- Where's Huck?
-I think he had a date.

443
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,783
I wonder if he told her
he used to be a spy.

444
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:47,335
<i>(Ashley) So the secret service</i>
<i>took her from the oval office</i>

445
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:48,569
<i>and just threw her</i>
<i>in the basement?</i>

446
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,971
<i>Nobody threw anybody</i>
<i>anywhere, Ashley.</i>

447
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,873
If I'm ever shot, I want her
running the press conference.

448
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:54,192
Makes you wonder why she ever
left the White House.

449
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:56,710
<i>...And equipped with</i>
<i>state-of-the-art communications</i>

450
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:57,994
<i>and a highly trained staff.</i>

451
00:18:59,697 --> 00:19:00,981
Livvie.

452
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,749
(Indistinct conversations,
phone ringing)

453
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,951
I haven't seen you.

454
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:06,269
I'm busy.

455
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:08,788
I'm busy, too, however,
I'm not sending my aides

456
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,707
to meetings
in an attempt to avoid you.

457
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:12,092
I'm busy.

458
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:13,476
(Lowered voice)
Olivia, I miss you.

459
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:15,562
You walked her
to my cabin door.

460
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:16,947
I didn't have a choice.

461
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,531
I don't know
what you expect.

462
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,567
I don't want to be in this.
This is...

463
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:22,752
- I am not this person.
- Look...

464
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,704
(Lowered voice)
I know this is difficult.

465
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:25,939
Difficult? Are you...
Ahem.

466
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,226
Somehow,
I've become this person who...

467
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,443
I have no words.

468
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:32,162
We are together.

469
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:33,813
(Whispers)
That's all that matters.

470
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:36,081
Really? Because I'm feeling
a little, I don't know,

471
00:19:36,116 --> 00:19:38,234
Sally hemings/thomas Jefferson
about all this.

472
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:39,285
I have to go.

473
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:40,736
Livvie.

474
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:43,572
I have to go.
I have a meeting with Cyrus.

475
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:47,576
I'm afraid we're just
backed into a corner

476
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,211
on this one, verna.

477
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:49,544
When Sally signed
on to the campaign,

478
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:51,680
- Fitz had to promise that...
- I don't care what he promised.

479
00:19:51,714 --> 00:19:53,832
Justice Williams has a year,
maybe two left in him, tops,

480
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:56,334
before he retires, so we'll get
another shot at this.

481
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:57,986
You're a slam dunk for
the next spot on the court,

482
00:19:58,004 --> 00:19:59,420
- but we can't just...
- Have you two lost your minds?

483
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,823
I whored every ounce
of my integrity

484
00:20:01,857 --> 00:20:03,424
to get that man elected,

485
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:05,860
and here you are,
sitting on mount Olympus,

486
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:07,662
telling me to go be
a good mortal,

487
00:20:07,696 --> 00:20:10,331
and we'll send down some nectar
when we find the time.

488
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:11,633
No, sir.

489
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,351
No how.

490
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:15,370
Make it happen.

491
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:16,604
(Door closes)

492
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:20,190
The Detroit teachers union
seems to have decided

493
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:22,509
that now would be a good time
to go on strike.

494
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:23,478
Kim jong-il is engaging

495
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:25,663
in some fairly serious saber
rattling in the yellow sea,

496
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:28,215
and there have been six more
allegations of sexual misconduct

497
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:30,100
at the n.A.T.O. Base
in east Sudan.

498
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:31,552
So it's an easy day.

499
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:32,987
Oh, I also got a call
from some reporter

500
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:34,988
about some kind of
voting irregularities in Ohio,

501
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:37,091
- but it's nothing I can't handle.
- What was their name?

502
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,643
Oh, Richard something.
I'll take care of it.

503
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:42,279
No, I got it.
Give me his number.

504
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:50,854
Huck, it's Olivia Pope.

505
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:52,506
Can you do me a favor?

506
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,624
Morris.

507
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:55,642
Ms. Pope.

508
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,409
- I gave him some funyuns...
- Thank you.

509
00:20:57,427 --> 00:20:58,511
But I couldn't let him
on the grounds.

510
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,263
I understand. Huck?

511
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:03,850
The reporter you asked about
got his information

512
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:05,101
from a Jesse Tyler.

513
00:21:05,152 --> 00:21:06,969
He's an employee
of Cytron software

514
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:08,587
in palo alto, California.

515
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:10,523
Where have you been living?

516
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,225
A halfway house
on 6th street.

517
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:15,495
Huck, you live with me now.

518
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:18,347
But some clippers, give yourself
a haircut, take a shower.

519
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:20,400
- And, Huck?
- Yeah?

520
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:23,035
Take that shower before you
touch anything in my apartment.

521
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:24,771
Mm-hmm.

522
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:33,678
A Jesse Tyler is
calling some reporter,

523
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:36,047
hinting at voter fraud
in Ohio.

524
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:38,233
That boy's proving to be
a right pain in my oysters.

525
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:39,651
You know him.

526
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:42,187
Been calling my office,
looking to shake me down.

527
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:44,272
Appears he's trying
to call my bluff.

528
00:21:44,323 --> 00:21:45,257
You need to handle this.

529
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,008
Don't you worry a bit
about it.

530
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:50,295
Young Mr. Tyler's punching
way above his weight.

531
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:51,630
I got this, darlin'.

532
00:21:53,232 --> 00:21:55,900
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

533
00:21:56,918 --> 00:21:59,086
(Crickets chirping)

534
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,054
What's wrong?

535
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:01,338
(Sighs)

536
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:03,090
You pace in circles
when something's wrong.

537
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:05,125
When you're just thinking,
it's back and forth,

538
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,928
but when something's wrong...
Circles.

539
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:10,798
Did you need something,
Mr. President?

540
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:12,299
See, you used to sound sexy

541
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:13,851
when you called me
"Mr. President."

542
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:15,786
Now it just sounds like
I'm a gym teacher.

543
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,120
Did you need something?

544
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,472
The Sally hemings-
Thomas Jefferson comment

545
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:21,158
- was below the belt.
- Because it's so untrue?

546
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:22,343
You're playing the race card
on the fact

547
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:24,111
that I'm in love with you?
(Scoffs)

548
00:22:24,145 --> 00:22:26,380
(Laughs)
Come on. Don't belittle us.

549
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:27,898
It's insulting
and beneath you

550
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:30,934
and designed to drive me away.
I'm not going away.

551
00:22:30,968 --> 00:22:32,603
I don't have to
drive you away.

552
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:34,170
You're married,
you have children,

553
00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:35,422
you're the leader
of the free world.

554
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:37,407
You <i>are</i> away.
By definition, you're away.

555
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,125
You're unavailable.

556
00:22:39,176 --> 00:22:40,560
So this is about Mellie?

557
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:42,112
N-no! This is...

558
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:43,496
(Crying)

559
00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:48,668
I smile at her and I take off
my clothes for you.

560
00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:51,354
I wait for you.
I watch for you.

561
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:53,323
My whole life is you.

562
00:22:53,357 --> 00:22:55,592
I can't breathe
because I'm waiting for you.

563
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:59,262
You own me. You control me.
I-I belong to you. I...

564
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,530
You own <i>me!</i>

565
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:03,133
<i>You</i> control me.
I belong to <i>you.</i>

566
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,518
You think I don't want to be
a better man?

567
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,704
You think that I don't want to
dedicate myself to my marriage?

568
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:10,189
You don't think
I want to be honorable,

569
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,974
to be the man
that you voted for?

570
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:14,126
I love you.
I'm in love with you.

571
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,345
You're the love of my life.

572
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:19,881
My every feeling is controlled
by the look on your face.

573
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,185
I can't breathe without you.
I can't sleep without you.

574
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:25,187
I wait for you.
I watch for you.

575
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:27,356
I exist for you.

576
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,358
If I could escape
all of this

577
00:23:29,392 --> 00:23:31,660
and run away with you...

578
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,865
There's no Sally
or Thomas here.

579
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:39,084
You're nobody's victim,
Liv.

580
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,453
I belong to <i>you.</i>

581
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,905
We're in this together.

582
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:51,680
(Footsteps depart)

583
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:00,069
We're gonna be here
all night with you.

584
00:24:00,803 --> 00:24:02,621
Once again,

585
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:04,606
some three hours ago,
President Grant was shot

586
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,142
entering his birthday gala a...

587
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:08,610
I'm being told right now

588
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:11,179
that White House press secretary
Britta Kagen

589
00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:13,281
succumbed to her injuries
in surgery

590
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:15,117
and was pronounced dead
only moments ago.

591
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:17,269
Britta Kagen was 32 years old.

592
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,671
She has 2 daughters,
ages 5 and 3.

593
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:23,391
She started her career here
at BNC.

594
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:26,928
(Paper rustles)

595
00:24:27,763 --> 00:24:29,229
Let's go to Vanessa Leone

596
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:31,298
who's live at the vigil
in Lafayette Square.

597
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:34,401
(Cell phone rings)

598
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:38,455
- You all right?
- They just let us out of the bunker.

599
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:39,941
What the hell is going on
over there?

600
00:24:39,975 --> 00:24:40,958
What do you mean?

601
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:42,909
The Vice President
is making a play.

602
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:44,378
She spent the last two hours
lobbying cabinet members

603
00:24:44,412 --> 00:24:46,513
about signing over
the presidency to her.

604
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:47,731
She <i>what?</i>

605
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:49,466
All she needs is a majority...
Eight signatures,

606
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,235
and she's home.
She's two away.

607
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:53,654
Traitorous bastards. Jeannine,
get the cabinet in here.

608
00:24:53,688 --> 00:24:56,871
- The whole...
- Yes! The whole cabinet.

609
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:57,924
Cyrus, there's another way.

610
00:24:58,743 --> 00:25:00,376
Sally set the narrative
that Fitz is dying,

611
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,827
on top of which
there's all sorts of rumors

612
00:25:01,846 --> 00:25:04,180
about Mellie and the baby.
People are scared.

613
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:06,082
There's only one person
who can turn this around,

614
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:08,201
who can assure the public,
and stop Sally in her tracks.

615
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:16,327
(Whispers) Mellie.

616
00:25:18,562 --> 00:25:19,562
(Gasps) Is he dead?

617
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:20,896
(Normal voice) What?

618
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:22,064
They told me when they
took him into surgery

619
00:25:22,098 --> 00:25:23,833
there was a chance
he might die on the table.

620
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,451
They seemed
kind of scared of me,

621
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:26,952
so I thought
they'd ask you to come in

622
00:25:26,987 --> 00:25:29,188
and tell me that he was dead,
which would be...

623
00:25:29,222 --> 00:25:30,506
Is he?

624
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:32,274
I don't...
I don't know anything. No.

625
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:33,676
(Exhales deeply)

626
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,094
Mellie, I'm sorry, but I need
to talk to you a...

627
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:38,113
<i>Don't</i> sit down next to me

628
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:40,199
like we are friends.

629
00:25:41,768 --> 00:25:43,486
Sally Langston

630
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,472
is knocking on the door
of the oval office.

631
00:25:47,406 --> 00:25:48,890
You need to make sure

632
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:50,942
the American people don't open
the door and let her in.

633
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:52,143
(Gasps)

634
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,448
(Sighs)

635
00:25:56,482 --> 00:25:59,217
I'll need something to wear.

636
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:00,785
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

637
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,020
Apparently,
everything is color-coded.

638
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:04,555
There are tags
on each dress

639
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:06,874
indicating the date
and the event.

640
00:26:06,908 --> 00:26:07,991
- Shoes have corr...
- Thank you.

641
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:09,577
But there's more.

642
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:10,794
Thank you.

643
00:26:13,715 --> 00:26:15,733
(Door closes)

644
00:26:53,004 --> 00:26:56,607
(Crying)

645
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:57,992
(Sniffs)

646
00:26:59,543 --> 00:27:01,010
That's the constitution,

647
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:02,912
the actual constitution.

648
00:27:08,217 --> 00:27:09,385
You want to touch it?

649
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,719
I'm not touching it.

650
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:12,021
- Touch it.
- No.

651
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:13,789
There are, like, six people
in the last hundred years

652
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:16,391
who touched the constitution.

653
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:18,644
- Be the seventh.
- You be the seventh.

654
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,579
I'm the sixth.
I touched it four seconds ago.

655
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:21,747
You didn't wait for me.

656
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,415
It's the constitution.

657
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:37,196
(Whispers) Wow.

658
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,348
(Whispers) Wow.

659
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:45,703
"We the people."

660
00:27:45,737 --> 00:27:48,122
That's just...

661
00:27:50,058 --> 00:27:52,092
That's...

662
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:53,644
Just...

663
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:58,633
That's everything.

664
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:03,721
(Whispers) It's a new world.

665
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:05,223
It's a new world.

666
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:15,749
(Whispering)
I love you, too.

667
00:28:15,784 --> 00:28:19,536
I'm in love with you, too.

668
00:28:22,974 --> 00:28:25,459
(Sniffles)

669
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:28,011
(Whispers)
So we're in this together?

670
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:34,400
We're in this together.

671
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:55,422
(Crying)

672
00:29:01,028 --> 00:29:03,913
(Sobbing)

673
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:17,510
(Stops crying)

674
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,401
(Sniffles)

675
00:29:24,452 --> 00:29:27,821
(Clears throat)

676
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:32,375
(Sniffles)

677
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,794
(Sighs)

678
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:40,532
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

679
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,630
Let's talk about the first lady.

680
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:03,300
If, God forbid,
her husband were to die,

681
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,169
things would happen rapidly
for her.

682
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,955
Jackie Kennedy was forced
to discuss housekeeping details

683
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:11,491
with lady bird Johnson
four days after

684
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:13,293
the assassination
of President Kennedy,

685
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:14,510
and she was
out of the White House

686
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:15,913
within two weeks of his death.

687
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:21,050
One hopes that Mellie Grant,
pregnant with America's baby,

688
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,570
would be afforded
a far different outcome.

689
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:25,321
First of all, I'd like
to offer my condolences

690
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:27,473
to the family of Britta Kagen.
(Camera shutters clicking)

691
00:30:27,508 --> 00:30:28,975
She served this country
honorably,

692
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:32,562
and we all owe her
an enormous debt.

693
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:35,731
I'd like to thank Hal Rimbeau,

694
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:38,717
the secret service agent
who took a bullet last night

695
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:42,321
but continues to stand watch
over my family.

696
00:30:42,355 --> 00:30:44,073
I would also like to thank

697
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:47,960
those of you who have put
my husband in your prayers.

698
00:30:47,994 --> 00:30:50,663
Not only is my husband
a religious man,

699
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:54,166
he's a man who believes
that hope has power.

700
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,384
So...

701
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:59,671
Having America pulling
for him...

702
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:01,840
(Sighs)

703
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:04,442
Well, that just means
the world to him.

704
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:08,580
Now...
About my husband's health...

705
00:31:08,614 --> 00:31:10,348
There have been rumors...

706
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:14,435
Rumors that are not only
hurtful to my family,

707
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:16,103
they are hurtful
to this country,

708
00:31:16,138 --> 00:31:18,356
so let me put them to rest.

709
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,958
America has a President...

710
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:22,793
A living President,

711
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:26,647
and his name is
Fitzgerald Grant.

712
00:31:26,682 --> 00:31:28,699
He hasn't given up on you,

713
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:32,285
so please don't give up on him.

714
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,288
(Camera shutters clicking)

715
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:36,273
Thank you.

716
00:31:36,307 --> 00:31:37,458
(Camera shutter clicks)

717
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:38,959
(Mellie) Get his good side,
gentlemen.

718
00:31:38,993 --> 00:31:40,077
Focus on her.
She's better-looking.

719
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:41,244
(Laughs)

720
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:43,730
- Oh, your flag pin.
- What?

721
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:46,282
- Your flag pin's missing.
- Oh, I must have lost it somewhere.

722
00:31:48,202 --> 00:31:50,203
(Chuckles)

723
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:54,157
(Clicking continues)

724
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:56,626
It's called 50/50.
You go out into the community

725
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,677
for two years,
tutor inner-city kids,

726
00:31:58,728 --> 00:32:00,862
build homes, help with
environmental cleanup,

727
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,064
work for next to nothing,

728
00:32:02,082 --> 00:32:04,150
and in return, we give you
money for college.

729
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:05,417
And your boss proves once again

730
00:32:05,452 --> 00:32:06,986
that he's a conservative
in name only.

731
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,187
We need you to help sell it.

732
00:32:08,188 --> 00:32:10,038
It's a boondoggle,

733
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:11,423
but I'll sell it.

734
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,124
Super.

735
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:13,425
But let me remind you again

736
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,777
that there is a vacancy
in the supreme court,

737
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:17,179
and I've made my decision.

738
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,481
My choice is
Bradley Hargrove.

739
00:32:19,515 --> 00:32:21,282
I want him trotted out
in grand style,

740
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:24,686
confirmed by congress,
without so much as a scratch.

741
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,639
I'll inform the President
of your choice.

742
00:32:27,673 --> 00:32:29,741
Glad to be a team player, Cyrus.

743
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:31,860
(Door opens)

744
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:34,062
(Door closes)

745
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:39,267
Do I have to do it,
or can you?

746
00:32:39,301 --> 00:32:40,484
It has to be you.

747
00:32:42,237 --> 00:32:44,455
I need to talk to you
privately.

748
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:46,357
No. We are not
getting back together.

749
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:47,608
I want
to give you something.

750
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:48,943
Besides the last year
of my life back?

751
00:32:48,977 --> 00:32:50,595
James.

752
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:53,014
You won
what I'm giving you.

753
00:32:53,648 --> 00:32:54,932
A story?

754
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:56,900
A name.

755
00:32:56,951 --> 00:32:58,785
A nomination. Come on.

756
00:33:00,488 --> 00:33:02,372
They're saying hargrove,
my nominee,

757
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:04,357
- had a juvenile record.
- Well, does he?

758
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:06,409
He was 15. It was
supposed to be sealed.

759
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:08,011
We can counter this.
It's not too late.

760
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:10,330
No supreme court nominee
recovers from a hit like this.

761
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:11,932
Pay your maid
with the wrong checkbook,

762
00:33:11,966 --> 00:33:12,999
and you're toast.
But a criminal record?

763
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,801
His nomination's
as good as dead...

764
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:16,252
- Sally...
- And I think you killed it!

765
00:33:16,587 --> 00:33:19,789
I think you made promises
you never intended to keep

766
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,840
because you needed me
on the ticket.

767
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,158
Well, let me make a promise
to you.

768
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:24,093
I am in this for me now!

769
00:33:25,744 --> 00:33:27,379
Based on the gaggle,
you can expect the usual

770
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:28,647
"what'll be
in the state of the union?"

771
00:33:28,682 --> 00:33:30,149
And the S.C.O.T.U.S. put
Verna's name out there,

772
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:31,717
so you'll get questions
about that.

773
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:33,552
Oh, and you may get asked about
this explosion in California.

774
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,787
What explosion?

775
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:36,322
In Palo Alto,
a software company blew up.

776
00:33:36,356 --> 00:33:38,157
- Seven people killed.
- Terror connection?

777
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:40,025
Uh, too soon to say.
Could be an angry girlfriend.

778
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:43,095
Anyway, the company's name
is Cytron, if it comes up.

779
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:45,914
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

780
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:50,736
What did you do?
Did you blow up that office?

781
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,454
Did you kill seven people?

782
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,823
You said to take care of it.
I took care of it.

783
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:57,142
I didn't say to commit
cold-blooded murder.

784
00:33:57,176 --> 00:33:59,211
We all done what we done.

785
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,163
Can't get your cherry back.

786
00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:02,648
(Exhales)

787
00:34:02,682 --> 00:34:04,633
(Whispers) Seven people.

788
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,118
Collateral damage.

789
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:09,470
Jesse Tyler could've ended
this presidency before it began.

790
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,789
We're in this thing.

791
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:14,058
There's no turning away
if things get a tad messy.

792
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,327
You don't get that,

793
00:34:16,362 --> 00:34:18,446
you're living in a fantasy.

794
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:30,913
(Camera shutters clicking)

795
00:34:30,914 --> 00:34:32,431
He came through the surgery
well.

796
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,566
We were able to remove
all three bullets,

797
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:36,635
and his intracranial pressure
is coming down,

798
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,554
but he's still unresponsive.

799
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:41,223
Okay.
So what do we do now?

800
00:34:41,258 --> 00:34:42,525
We wait.

801
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,459
How long?

802
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:44,727
We don't know.

803
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:47,046
Truthfully, it could be a day.
It could be a week.

804
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,414
You have got to give me
something more, Dr. Carroll.

805
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,766
You have got to,
because "I don't know"

806
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,420
is not an acceptable answer.

807
00:34:54,454 --> 00:34:58,257
There was a lot of damage,
Mrs. Grant.

808
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:02,226
At this point,
he's lucky to be alive.

809
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:04,762
(Crying)

810
00:35:08,517 --> 00:35:10,217
Even with
the cabinet members' votes,

811
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:11,635
there might still be a way
to avoid this.

812
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:14,038
Cyrus. We find any
technicalities, even small ones,

813
00:35:14,105 --> 00:35:15,506
exploit them to their fullest.

814
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,209
Cyrus, stop!

815
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:19,176
It's over.

816
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,228
(Pants)

817
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:24,965
(Kisses)
Oh. Excuse me.

818
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,900
Sorry.
We're celebrating.

819
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:27,651
What's the occasion?

820
00:35:27,685 --> 00:35:28,735
I-I...

821
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:30,303
He asked me to marry
him, and I said yes.

822
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:32,055
And we're gonna have
a wedding and a baby

823
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:33,824
- and a house in Georgetown
with a garden. - Eh.

824
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:36,193
Oh, do you need
to talk to him?

825
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:37,994
Because I'm engaged.
I could go plan things.

826
00:35:38,028 --> 00:35:39,829
Okay.

827
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:41,431
(Chuckles)

828
00:35:41,465 --> 00:35:43,549
(Door opens and closes)

829
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:46,119
What is it?

830
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:49,621
That explosion in California...
Cytron...

831
00:35:49,656 --> 00:35:51,340
That was Hollis.

832
00:35:51,374 --> 00:35:54,043
(Gasps and exhales deeply)

833
00:35:56,296 --> 00:35:57,696
Thought it might be.

834
00:35:57,731 --> 00:36:00,282
He killed seven people, Cy,

835
00:36:00,316 --> 00:36:02,267
and he's setting some
poor innocent girl up for it.

836
00:36:02,302 --> 00:36:04,319
Her name's Lindsay Dwyer.

837
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:05,821
How shall we handle this?
What'll we do?

838
00:36:05,855 --> 00:36:07,589
There isn't anything
we <i>can</i> do.

839
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,308
What? There's always
something we can do.

840
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,310
Olivia, we're an hour and a half
from the state of the union.

841
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:14,495
We're an hour and a half
from giving kids

842
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:15,880
a chance to go to college,

843
00:36:15,915 --> 00:36:18,132
an hour and a half from changing
this nation for the better,

844
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:20,852
so what exactly would you have
us do? Expose what we did?

845
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:22,136
Have Fitz resign?

846
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:23,321
Make Sally Langston

847
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:24,589
the President
of the United States?

848
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:28,109
Hollis is
a dangerous person.

849
00:36:28,127 --> 00:36:31,179
We won.
Hollis isn't a threat to us.

850
00:36:31,213 --> 00:36:32,663
No one's a threat to us,

851
00:36:32,698 --> 00:36:34,482
because we <i>won.</i>

852
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:38,352
And it is sad what happened
to those seven people,

853
00:36:38,386 --> 00:36:39,753
it is heartbreaking,

854
00:36:39,771 --> 00:36:41,922
but they gave their lives
in service to their country.

855
00:36:41,956 --> 00:36:43,457
Lindsay dwyer
will give up her freedom

856
00:36:43,491 --> 00:36:44,925
in service to her country,

857
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:46,593
and that makes them
American heroes.

858
00:36:46,627 --> 00:36:48,795
That makes them patriots.

859
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,998
And the best way that I can
honor their sacrifice

860
00:36:52,016 --> 00:36:53,467
is to move on.

861
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:55,002
Buckle down.

862
00:36:58,372 --> 00:37:00,490
Liv, how are you?

863
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:02,141
Excited for the state
of the union speech tonight?

864
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:04,076
- Yes. (Chuckles)
- I'm excited, too.

865
00:37:04,094 --> 00:37:05,595
I read a final draft
of the speech.

866
00:37:05,629 --> 00:37:06,813
You and Fitz
did an amazing job.

867
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:08,181
Thank you, Mrs. Grant.

868
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:10,516
Well, I have something
of yours.

869
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:12,085
The secret service found it.
You know Hal, right?

870
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,419
He's on p.O.T.U.S. Detail.

871
00:37:13,454 --> 00:37:14,704
He found it the night
the President went

872
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:16,372
to the national archives
to view the constitution,

873
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:18,057
which surprised me,
because...

874
00:37:18,092 --> 00:37:20,260
If he'd gone to
the national archives to view

875
00:37:20,294 --> 00:37:21,861
the original constitution
of the United States,

876
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:26,232
he would've invited his wife,
but Hal said you were there.

877
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:28,067
So...

878
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:31,170
Mellie, I...

879
00:37:31,204 --> 00:37:35,207
We all want the same thing.
You and me, Cyrus...

880
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:36,692
We are a team.

881
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:38,977
We got him
in the White House,

882
00:37:39,012 --> 00:37:41,447
and we are going
to keep him here.

883
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:43,549
We are doing
our patriotic duty,

884
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:44,650
serving our country,

885
00:37:44,684 --> 00:37:46,719
working
for the greater good.

886
00:37:46,753 --> 00:37:49,521
We just...

887
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:51,773
Go about it differently,

888
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:53,224
I suppose.

889
00:37:58,914 --> 00:38:02,217
You'll make sure
Fitz gets this?

890
00:38:03,836 --> 00:38:05,253
(Whispers) Yes.

891
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:08,390
Thank you, Olivia.

892
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:12,410
(Applause)

893
00:38:12,444 --> 00:38:16,197
We gather this evening with
a new mandate for America.

894
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:18,883
<i>The American people</i>
<i>have made it clear</i>

895
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:22,336
<i>that they want an end</i>
<i>to partisan rancor,</i>

896
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:25,288
<i>and every new President</i>
<i>stands here</i>

897
00:38:25,323 --> 00:38:27,724
<i>vowing that things</i>
<i>will be different,</i>

898
00:38:27,758 --> 00:38:30,060
and nothing changes,

899
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:32,529
so listen to me carefully now.

900
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:34,814
This time <i>will</i> be different.

901
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:36,900
<i>(Cheers and applause)</i>

902
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:38,552
(Indistinct shouting)

903
00:38:38,586 --> 00:38:42,889
<i>I dedicate this presidency</i>
<i>to bringing integrity back,</i>

904
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,025
<i>responsibility back,</i>

905
00:38:45,076 --> 00:38:47,210
<i>governing back.</i>

906
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:49,713
<i>And I will remind</i>
<i>both my own party</i>

907
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:52,382
<i>and those across the aisle</i>
<i>every day,</i>

908
00:38:52,516 --> 00:38:55,051
<i>that we have the sworn duty,</i>

909
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:58,571
<i>the sacred obligation to not</i>
<i>just pay lip service,</i>

910
00:38:58,622 --> 00:39:04,110
<i>but to actually, finally,</i>
<i>and definitively do better.</i>

911
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:09,949
<i>(Cheers and applause)</i>

912
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:13,803
And so I leave you
with this pledge.

913
00:39:13,837 --> 00:39:17,690
At this time, in this place,

914
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:19,742
with this presidency,

915
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:24,497
it... will... be... different.

916
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:27,500
(Cheers and applause)

917
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:55,742
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

918
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:08,055
I, Sally Margaret Langston,
do solemnly swear...

919
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:10,657
<i>(Reed) President Sally Langston</i>
<i>makes history today</i>

920
00:40:10,692 --> 00:40:12,843
<i>as not only the first President</i>
<i>to take office</i>

921
00:40:12,894 --> 00:40:14,678
<i>under section 4</i>
<i>of the 25th amendment,</i>

922
00:40:14,729 --> 00:40:18,899
<i>but also as the first female</i>
<i>commander in chief.</i>

923
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:20,634
And will,
to the best of my ability...

924
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:23,202
And will, to the best
of my ability...

925
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,121
<i>The President remains in...</i>

926
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,172
<i>And I call him "President"</i>

927
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,658
<i>because technically, he is</i>
<i>still President as well...</i>

928
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:30,960
<i>President Grant remains</i>
<i>in critical condition.</i>

929
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,613
<i>There is no more information</i>
<i>on his status at this time.</i>

930
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:35,131
(Verna) So help you God?

931
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,166
So help me God.

932
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,401
Congratulations,
madam President.

933
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,569
Thank you.

934
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,971
<i>All we can do as a nation</i>
<i>is pray.</i>

935
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:46,590
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

936
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,960
<i>The FBI is issuing</i>

937
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:07,878
what's called a high alert,

938
00:41:07,896 --> 00:41:10,915
and they... they do have
a description of a suspect.

939
00:41:10,949 --> 00:41:13,051
The suspect is dark-haired,

940
00:41:13,085 --> 00:41:14,886
average height and build,

941
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,455
possibly with a buzz cut,

942
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,824
<i>seen entering</i>
<i>the Stanworth Hotel</i>

943
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:23,094
<i>wearing a red hoodie.</i>

944
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:25,063
<i>This is</i>
<i>America's most wanted man.</i>

945
00:41:25,097 --> 00:41:27,198
Average height, average build,
wearing a red hoodie...

946
00:41:27,232 --> 00:41:28,700
In Washington, D.C.,
home of the Redskins,

947
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:30,801
that narrows it down
to about 100,000 people.

948
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:32,103
Don't.
(Sighs)

949
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:34,171
<i>We're gonna be here all night</i>
<i>with you.</i>

950
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:36,824
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>at 8:05 Eastern standard time,</i>

951
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:38,342
<i>some 14 hours ago,</i>

952
00:41:38,377 --> 00:41:41,078
<i>President Grant was shot</i>
<i>entering his birthday gala.</i>

953
00:41:41,113 --> 00:41:43,180
<i>(Cheers and applause)</i>

954
00:41:43,198 --> 00:41:45,750
<i>(People screaming)</i>
