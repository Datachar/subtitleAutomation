1
00:00:01,644 --> 00:00:03,761
If that letter from
President Grant was forged,

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,062
there will be joint
congressional hearings

3
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:07,181
- and letters of impeachment.
- Good-bye, Edison.

4
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:09,733
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

5
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:11,267
Which one of you
forged his signature?

6
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,870
- I did.
- It's a federal crime. It's treason.

7
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:16,523
I have a sworn affidavit
saying that your husband

8
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:19,342
has failed to so much
as open his eyes.

9
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:20,560
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?

10
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:21,911
Hi.

11
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:23,530
(Voice breaks) Hi.

12
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:28,134
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

13
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:33,072
Oh, hi.

14
00:00:33,107 --> 00:00:34,206
"Oh. Hi"?
(Keys jangle)

15
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:35,441
Hello, Edison.

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,211
Olivia.

17
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,798
- What?
- What's going on? With us.

18
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:43,682
(Files rustling)
Nothing.

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,484
- Nothing's going on with us?
- Edison.

20
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:49,104
This serious boyfriend
that you had,

21
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:50,254
the one that you broke up with...

22
00:00:50,273 --> 00:00:51,490
Look, I have a lot to do
tomorrow,

23
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:53,642
and I haven't had much sleep
and I'm not in the mood to...

24
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:55,410
This serious boyfriend...
Was it Fitzgerald Grant?

25
00:00:57,763 --> 00:01:00,181
(Chuckles)

26
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:02,150
You're asking me
if I was in a relationship

27
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:03,668
- with the President?
- Yes.

28
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:04,803
- He's married.
- Yes.

29
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:05,904
- He's the President.
- Yes.

30
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:07,655
Is this a joke?
Are you kidding?

31
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,074
I'm waiting for you
to answer the question.

32
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:13,627
You're mad because
I wouldn't let you

33
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:14,912
into the President's
hospital room?

34
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:19,033
Not mad. Concerned.
Wary. Suspicious.

35
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:21,369
- Don't be. - Because the
President's not your boyfriend?

36
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:24,438
You really want to stop
asking me that.

37
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,356
I've been racking my brain
trying to find a reason

38
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:28,259
why you'd be stupid enough
to willingly attempt

39
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:29,727
to defraud the American people,

40
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:31,295
and the only reason
I can come up with

41
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:32,563
for why you'd be in so deep

42
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:35,031
is because you were his mistress.

43
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:39,002
Five...
that's sexist and insulting.

44
00:01:39,036 --> 00:01:40,954
You'd never suggest
Scooter Libby

45
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:42,539
was screwing Dick Cheney.

46
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:45,225
Four... the lengths you're going
to try to twist this

47
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:47,210
into a conspiracy are
cause for concern.

48
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:48,745
You should speak to
someone about that.

49
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:51,214
Three... the President
is awake and talking,

50
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:54,201
and the suggestion that he isn't
is partisan political crap

51
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:57,053
that I thought you had
enough integrity to rise above.

52
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:58,838
Two...
in the past three minutes,

53
00:01:58,872 --> 00:02:00,740
you've called me a criminal,
a whore,

54
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:02,442
an idiot, and a liar,

55
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:04,744
so this is pretty much the
last time we'll be speaking,

56
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:07,730
so one...who I am or
am <i>not</i> screwing,

57
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:09,131
what am or am not doing,

58
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,251
is no longer any of
your damn business.

59
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:14,420
You forget how well
I know you.

60
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:17,623
You this angry?
You have something to hide.

61
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:19,142
I have been summoned
to a meeting

62
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:21,210
at the white house tomorrow
with acting President Langston

63
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:22,645
about the letter
of reinstatement,

64
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:24,981
which she says is a forgery.
(Scoffs)

65
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:26,866
And she's going to tell that
to the entire cabinet

66
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:28,684
first thing in the morning.

67
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:31,220
So if there's something
that you want to tell me,

68
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:34,856
do it now, when I still
have time to help you.

69
00:02:51,307 --> 00:02:52,691
(Beep)

70
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:55,677
Cyrus, we have a problem.

71
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:58,547
(Projector
and camera shutter clicking)

72
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:01,683
sync and corrections by bellows
www.addic7ed.com

73
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:04,352
Increasing our military
presence in Asia

74
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:05,770
costs money, Governor.

75
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:08,189
Which is why we'd have to
shift our defense spend...

76
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:10,091
Can't just run to daddy
and ask for the dough

77
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,792
on this one.
(Laughter)

78
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,127
(Lowered voice) Use the attack line.
Attack line.

79
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:15,430
Go to my web site.
Look at my spending plans.

80
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:17,131
- Do the math.
- Oh, no.

81
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:18,683
Now he's giving
the voters homework.

82
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:20,518
Fiscal budget, we can afford to
make this common reallocation.

83
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:21,769
I'm sorry, Governor.
We have to move on.

84
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:23,004
I deserve a chance
to respond.

85
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,072
You think you deserve
everything, don't you, Governor?

86
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:26,524
(Laughter)
No... (Chuckles)

87
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:28,276
No. If we could get
back to medicare.

88
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,610
Look. Look.
Governor Reston...

89
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:31,145
- I can't.
- Tell me when it's over.

90
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:33,664
You need 270 electoral
college votes to win, right?

91
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:36,451
And you've got 188 locked up
from the deep red states.

92
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:38,002
So you need a pickup
of 82 votes,

93
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:40,288
most likely from a
combination of Ohio,

94
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:43,040
Florida, Virginia, Colorado,
Nevada, North Carolina.

95
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:46,127
So, basically, you can't afford
to lose more than one of them.

96
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,995
- And if I do?
- You're toast.

97
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:49,647
Did the debate
move the needle at all?

98
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:52,166
Not in your favor.
I'm sorry, Governor.

99
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:54,101
Numbers don't lie.

100
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:56,155
(Projector and
camera shutter clicks)

101
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:59,140
As the individual helping
finance this little enterprise,

102
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:01,643
I'd like to start feeling like
I'm getting my money's worth.

103
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:03,111
We've still got a month left.

104
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:04,345
Plenty of time
to turn things around.

105
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:05,513
That's just whistlin'
past the graveyard.

106
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:08,033
- We need to do something.
- You have a suggestion?

107
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,018
Stack the deck.

108
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:12,153
I found a computer nerd
of my own,

109
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:14,656
says he can rig the election
for Grant, easy as pie.

110
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,541
- Very funny.
- Am I laughing?

111
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:18,326
(Lowered voice) Okay.
You saying "rig the election"

112
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,880
on a campaign plane is like
joking that you have a bomb

113
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:23,548
in the security line
at the airport.

114
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:25,366
You don't do it unless
you want to end up

115
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:28,169
having your body cavities
searched by big men with guns.

116
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:30,138
Whoa.
Just trying to help.

117
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:32,874
We got a problem.
I am a solution man.

118
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:34,009
Your solution is a felony.

119
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,343
Well, then,
you're the fix-it gal.

120
00:04:35,377 --> 00:04:36,728
Quit bitchin'
and start pitchin'.

121
00:04:36,762 --> 00:04:38,930
(Clears throat)
Those numbers are fatal.

122
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:40,932
(Clears throat)
What this campaign needs

123
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:43,601
is a big pointy boot
to kick it square in the ass.

124
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:45,403
I was thinking... (Sighs)

125
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:47,906
Maybe it's time
we brought in help.

126
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,108
- He's not gonna like it.
- He will learn to like it.

127
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,994
We talking about Jerry?

128
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:53,028
Fitz's father?
That's... that's brilliant.

129
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:54,496
I wondered why
he wasn't on the trail.

130
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,331
I figured maybe his health
wasn't good.

131
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:57,866
(Cyrus) Oh, it's good.

132
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,334
The good senator
Fitzgerald Thomas Grant II's

133
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:01,169
gonna bury us all.

134
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:03,755
Fitz has been very clear
about his father.

135
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,390
He'll never agree to it.

136
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:06,524
That was then.

137
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,242
This is 10 points down.

138
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,761
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

139
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:11,930
No! You know better!
You know!

140
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:13,431
We are losing!
We are lost!

141
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:14,933
I can win this on my own!

142
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:17,602
You have political capital!
You need to start spending it!

143
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:19,721
(Lowered voice) I need to
point out voices carry.

144
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:21,756
(Sighs) You might want to
either lower the volume

145
00:05:21,774 --> 00:05:24,609
or continue this
conversation in a room.

146
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:28,229
You talk to him.
He actually listens to you.

147
00:05:28,263 --> 00:05:32,266
(Beep, door opens and slams)

148
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,644
(Panting)

149
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:44,045
Fitz...
Mm?

150
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,780
We're all concerned that
the campaign needs a spark.

151
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:47,548
Your father could be it.

152
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:51,552
And I really don't want to
discuss my father right now.

153
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:52,270
(Exhales) Mm.

154
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,189
Your father...

155
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:56,590
Is a national treasure.

156
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,559
Self-made man,
two terms as...

157
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:00,477
Governor, 4-time senator.
I know.

158
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,546
The image of him passing on
the torch to his son...

159
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:05,032
That will ignite the base.
The press loves him.

160
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,667
Everyone loves him.

161
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,786
<i>I</i> don't want him here.

162
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:12,372
He can help.

163
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,009
You need help right now.

164
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:20,064
You really think
we're at that place?

165
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:21,715
We're at that place.

166
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,669
If I say yes,

167
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,271
will you stop talking
about the campaign

168
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,655
for the next 20 minutes?

169
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,090
Why?

170
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,860
Hmm...

171
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,149
(Gasps)

172
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,851
The bullet tore
through your frontal lobe.

173
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:43,853
We managed the swelling,
and with any luck,

174
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,705
the effects you see
will be minimal.

175
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,939
Effects such as?

176
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,474
Dizziness, fatigue, irritability.

177
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,493
The symptoms we commonly
associate with concussions.

178
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:52,211
And if they're not?

179
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,147
Our frontal lobes
control executive function.

180
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,965
So sometimes in patients
we've seen

181
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,034
an inability to make decisions,
a shorter attention span.

182
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:59,669
We've had patients who
haven't been able to write,

183
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:01,304
patients who suffer
from aphasia.

184
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,922
- Aphasia?
- Speech impairment?

185
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,240
Either you can't speak
at all, or if you can,

186
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:06,292
it's hard to find your words.

187
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,028
We'll also be on the lookout
for changes in personality.

188
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:10,696
It all depends on the patient.

189
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,715
That's why I want to get
a neurology team in here pronto

190
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:14,600
- and see where we are.
- So when can I get back to work?

191
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,435
Assuming there's no permanent
damage, three weeks.

192
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,703
(Sighs)

193
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,605
Walking across a room
will feel like a marathon.

194
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,790
(Knock on door)
Am I interrupting?

195
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,225
Thank you, doctor.

196
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,412
<i>(Woman speaking</i>
<i>indistinctly over P.A.)</i>

197
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,913
(Door closes)
What is it?

198
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,800
I'm afraid we have
a Sally Langston problem.

199
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,636
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

200
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:35,837
The letter of reinstatement

201
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,272
submitted on behalf
of President Grant

202
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:40,074
was entirely premature.

203
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,927
Regrettably, he is not
in any sort of condition

204
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,080
to resume the powers
and responsibilities

205
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:48,099
of this office at this time.

206
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,736
Understanding, as always,
that our first and only duty

207
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,755
is to the American people,

208
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,909
I have prepared a document
for your signatures

209
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:00,328
declaring that we are left no choice

210
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:03,014
but to challenge President
Grant's fitness...(Door opens)

211
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,365
To again assume...

212
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,986
Morning, everyone.

213
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,841
Sorry I'm late.

214
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,355
Are we sure this was
a good idea?

215
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:21,522
He's just gonna show his face,
shake a few hands,

216
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:22,874
hear ten minutes
of the briefing,

217
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:23,941
and go back to bed,

218
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,960
and Sally disappears forever

219
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:28,680
into that political black hole
called the vice presidency.

220
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:30,431
- He's looking great!
- Guy's a medical miracle.

221
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:33,868
Madame vice President,
how are you today?

222
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:38,723
(Laughs)
(Laughs)

223
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:41,559
That was small of me.
I need to work on that. (Chuckles)

224
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:44,295
I need a fresh shirt.

225
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,847
Ask Izzie to send one down for me.

226
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:48,182
Why don't you we get you up to bed?

227
00:08:48,216 --> 00:08:49,600
I have to get down
to the sit room.

228
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,168
Fitz, you did it.
You're back.

229
00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:53,036
You're President.
You have nothing to prove.

230
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:54,955
Until Sally Langston
puts a letter on my desk

231
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:58,141
accepting my reinstatement,
I have everything to prove.

232
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,843
Have I thanked you for that,
by the way?

233
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:01,078
For forging my signature

234
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:02,496
and forcing me
out of the hospital

235
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,697
before my stitches
had healed

236
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:05,683
to save you from jail
and keep my job?

237
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:07,935
Thank you.

238
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:10,621
(Sighs)

239
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:13,222
I can't show any weakness.

240
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:14,641
This is not
a show of weakness.

241
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:17,310
You were shot. You've made
a miraculous recovery.

242
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:19,112
No one is expecting you
to spend five hours

243
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:20,496
in a military briefing.

244
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:23,549
Sally Langston
is dancing around the fire.

245
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:27,353
She's not gonna stop
until my head's on a stick.

246
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:29,589
They need to see me,
not her,

247
00:09:29,623 --> 00:09:32,125
being commander-in-chief
of the armed forces.

248
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,977
I need a clean shirt.

249
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:36,846
And that's the difference

250
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,997
between Governor Reston and me.

251
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:41,500
My plan provides for $2 trillion
in discretionary spending.

252
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:43,101
Just say "spending cuts."

253
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:45,003
"Discretionary" confuses people.

254
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:47,455
$2 trillion in spending cuts,

255
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,891
which will save
Americans money

256
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:51,409
and stimulate growth.

257
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:55,196
Ah, to hell with spending cuts!
I want my taxes lowered!

258
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,964
(People murmuring) We titans
of industry built this nation.

259
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:59,017
We deserve to get a little relief

260
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:01,186
in these difficult economic times.

261
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,856
Everybody seems to forget
that the rich need help, too.

262
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,442
Boy, that sounded better in my head

263
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,710
than it did out loud, didn't it?
(Laughter)

264
00:10:08,744 --> 00:10:10,845
Jerry! (Laughing)
(Laughing)

265
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:12,213
We are so glad that you came.

266
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:13,398
Anything for you.
Oh.

267
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:15,033
Mwah!
(Laughs)

268
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:16,835
Good to see you, Jer.

269
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:18,853
- Hello, Fitzgerald.
- Dad.

270
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,956
Everybody,
why don't we take a break?

271
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:25,809
No, no, no. Keep working.
I'm just furniture.

272
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:27,611
(People murmuring)

273
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:28,929
Hello.

274
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,664
(Man) - Good to see you, Jerry.
- Hi.

275
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:32,049
Where was I?

276
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,768
(Olivia) Uh, save Americans
money, stimulate growth.

277
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:37,471
Save Americans money
and stimulate growth

278
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,239
while reducing the national debt

279
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:41,608
by $5 trillion over the next 10 years

280
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:43,293
from a deficit that
right now increases

281
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:46,730
by an average of
$3.68 billion a d...

282
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:49,265
Wait, wait, this isn't
a funeral, son.

283
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:51,717
Perk up! You got the looks.
Add the charm. (Chuckles)

284
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,936
- <i>As</i> I was saying...
(Jerry) - Okay, go on.

285
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:59,690
$5 trillion from a deficit
that right now increases

286
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:02,911
by an average
of $3.68 billion a day.

287
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,129
A day.

288
00:11:04,147 --> 00:11:05,564
When I am President,
I would...

289
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,033
Uh, no, no, no. Nobody wants
to hear all that math.

290
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,918
Here.
Let me show you how it's done.

291
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,720
Up, up, up!

292
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,572
(People murmuring)

293
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:15,841
Pleasure. (Sighs)

294
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,878
All right, sweetheart.
Feed it to me.

295
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,935
- A lot of people think this election
is about the economy. - Mm-hmm.

296
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,953
Tell us what differentiates
your economic plan

297
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:30,522
from Governor Reston's.

298
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:35,844
A mother is standing
on the sidewalk, choking.

299
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:38,430
She's, uh, swallowed
a penny accidentally,

300
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,632
and it's lodged in her throat.

301
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,918
A man in a suit comes by,

302
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,020
gives her the heimlich,
and out pops the penny.

303
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:47,939
Well, the... the woman says...

304
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,874
(Mouths words)
"Gosh darn,

305
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:51,859
I can't thank you enough."

306
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:53,878
And the guy in the suit said...

307
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,881
(Chuckles) "Oh...
Oh, no, I'm not a doctor.

308
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:58,499
I'm from the I.R.S.

309
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,685
and he snatched the penny
and he ran off.

310
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,837
That's what's gonna happen
if this guy wins the election.

311
00:12:03,871 --> 00:12:06,959
Next question.
(Laughter and applause)

312
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,745
(People laughing hysterically)

313
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,978
(Jerry) No! No!
That's not the best part.

314
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:15,766
I come back from Nevada
after watching them test

315
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,569
a hydrogen bomb, and I see
these bruises on my chest.

316
00:12:19,603 --> 00:12:21,921
So I go to an oncologist,
and I say,

317
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:23,423
"look at these bruises!

318
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:25,625
"I think I've been exposed
to radiation.

319
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,026
What should I do?"

320
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:28,878
And he looks at me
and he looks at my bruises,

321
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:31,514
and he says, "Nevada?"
And I go, "yeah."

322
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:33,733
He goes, "Jerry, that's
from leaning too hard

323
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,001
against the craps table."

324
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:36,185
(Laughter)

325
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:38,087
No, Verna was there.
She remembers.

326
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:40,306
- Well, I was more of a poker girl.
(Jerry) - Ah!

327
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:42,292
I bet she was.
(Laughter)

328
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:44,310
So when do you hit Florida?

329
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:46,162
Thursday.
You think you can join us, Jer?

330
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:48,765
- Hey...
(Fitz) - No.

331
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:52,367
You stump in Oregon.
I'll handle Florida myself.

332
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:54,553
(Laughs) Son...

333
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:55,938
Oh, no. You need me
in Florida.

334
00:12:55,972 --> 00:12:57,239
No, I don't.

335
00:12:57,273 --> 00:12:59,124
These young boys today.

336
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:00,709
They think they invented politics.

337
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:02,644
(Chuckling) We definitely
want you in Florida.

338
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,496
Did I say I want him in Florida?

339
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,765
(Mouths words) Look, I realize
you don't think I know anything,

340
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,867
but I've done more
in the past 20 years

341
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:11,220
than you'll do
in an entire lifetime.

342
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:13,222
You'll want me in Florida.

343
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:16,942
Unless you want to lose.
Do you want to lose, son?

344
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:18,377
(Scoffs)

345
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:25,033
(Swallows and sighs)

346
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:27,985
We'd be glad to have you.

347
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,887
So can I ask about
your campaign strategy?

348
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,572
No.

349
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,408
Honey. Why didn't you dig enough
dirt on Reston? (Liquid pouring)

350
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:37,594
We've had a clean campaign so far.

351
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:40,564
Fitz wants to keep it that way.
I think it's admirable.

352
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:43,316
Well, I think it's weak.
You want to win the presidency,

353
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:46,220
you have to attack, be strong.
Finish off your competition!

354
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:47,871
- You know this from experience?
- Fitz.

355
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:49,656
No, dad's giving me advice.
I'm just wondering

356
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:52,543
if it's from his vast experience
running for President.

357
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:54,178
Oh, yeah, you never ran, did you?

358
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:57,180
'Cause men who get caught
sleeping with prostitutes

359
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:58,665
don't get to be leader
of the free world.

360
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:00,483
Right?

361
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:01,635
Who wants coffee?

362
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:04,038
What was her name? Charity?
No, it was Hope.

363
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:08,041
Hard to forget that name.

364
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:09,893
You really kept hope alive,
didn't you, dad?

365
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:11,578
- Fitz.
- No, Hope is alive.

366
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:13,363
Mom's dead, though.

367
00:14:13,397 --> 00:14:15,865
(Mellie) - Enough.
(Fitz sighs)

368
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,367
(Sets down glass)

369
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:20,219
Jerry, I'm so sorry.

370
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:21,654
It's fine.

371
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:24,257
We have all had a long day. Hmm?

372
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,026
And I think I'm gonna turn in.

373
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,611
Mwah! (Kisses)
Mm.

374
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:30,646
Mm. Mm.
(Chuckles and kisses)

375
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:34,967
(Lowered voice) We'll talk
about this in the morning.

376
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,876
(Elevator bell dings)

377
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,261
(Sighs and mutters)

378
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,947
(Indistinct conversations)
(Clears throat)

379
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:54,453
You didn't wait for me.

380
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:57,356
It's late.
We can talk in the morning.

381
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,325
Or we can go to your room, talk there.

382
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:03,178
Or...

383
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:04,829
Not talk.
(Sighs)

384
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:06,698
Fitz, you're drunk.

385
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,034
And you're sad.

386
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:10,502
You should get to bed.

387
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,354
(Slurring) - I'm trying to get to bed.
- Stop it.

388
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:14,906
Come on.
Really, no. No.

389
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,558
You want to talk, we can talk.

390
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:19,628
We can get a cup of coffee, you can
sober up, but... mnh-mnh. Mnh.

391
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,313
(Stammering) No...
Come on.

392
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:23,081
(Elevator bell dings)
Stop it.

393
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:24,549
Fitzgerald.

394
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:26,318
(Head thuds)
Oh...

395
00:15:26,352 --> 00:15:28,470
(Sighs)

396
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:30,372
Um...

397
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,176
I'm sorry. I'm...

398
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:37,411
Sorry.

399
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:42,116
(Sighs)

400
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:46,070
Mellie...

401
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:47,738
I wanted to apologize for Fitz.

402
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:51,342
That's not like him, but he
has had too much to drink.

403
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,360
And he has always had
problems with his father,

404
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:55,913
and I just...

405
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:58,982
He respects you.
He needs you.

406
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,485
We both do, and...

407
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:05,556
I just don't want
what happened here tonight...

408
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,660
I'm so sorry.
I am.

409
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,596
I know how you must feel,
and I am so sorry.

410
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:14,598
It's okay.

411
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:17,051
Really.
I'm fine.

412
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,436
You don't have to apologize to me.

413
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:21,388
I don't know what he'd do without you.

414
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,840
I don't know what <i>I</i>
would do without you. (Chuckles)

415
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:25,408
(Breathes deeply)

416
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:36,924
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

417
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,044
The trouble with precision air
strikes is they're not precise.

418
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:41,295
There's too much
collateral damage.

419
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,781
Again, I think we should
have a S.E.A.L. team go in

420
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:45,683
and either capture or kill...

421
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:15,527
Kinyazi.

422
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,002
The east Sudan leader.

423
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:25,588
Send in a S.E.A.L. team
to capture or kill Kinyazi.

424
00:17:25,622 --> 00:17:26,972
Yes, exactly.

425
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,526
Thank you all.

426
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,511
Mr. President.
Mr. President.

427
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:42,287
(Projector
and camera shutter clicking)

428
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:45,290
There's no such thing as a
clean campaign! (Sighs)

429
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,008
It's an oxymoron!

430
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,143
From now on, you're...

431
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:49,644
There's still time
to call Hollis.

432
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,179
It's the only way
that you're gonna win this!

433
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:52,780
We don't have to put up with this.
(Shouting continues)

434
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:54,866
So we rig an election
instead, Cyrus?

435
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,968
I'm just saying it's an option.

436
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:59,437
I'm kidding.
(Door opens)

437
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:02,907
My son and I have had a talk.

438
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,426
We're gonna need oppo
on Reston. Everything...

439
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,978
S.A.T. scores,
parking tickets.

440
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:08,780
If he didn't put
the seat down once,

441
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:10,832
- we want to hear about it.
- Sir, with all due respect...

442
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:13,467
As I said before, we've been
running a clean campaign

443
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,868
since the primary.

444
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:16,836
Well, now I'm telling you
to get me some dirt

445
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:18,371
that we can pin on Reston.

446
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:20,540
- Sir, we don't work for you.
- We work for the Governor.

447
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:22,659
(Scoffs)

448
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:26,012
- Do we bring pillows to a
knife fight, son? - No, sir.

449
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:28,081
- Do we wanna run a real campaign?
- Yes, sir.

450
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:29,883
There you go.

451
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:33,536
Do what he says.

452
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:38,425
(Projector
and camera shutter clicking)

453
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,242
Harrison Wright, Abby Whelan.

454
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:41,927
The pleasure's all mine.
Hi.

455
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,779
Hi. Listen, we gotta
make this quick.

456
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:45,965
I got a meeting with the parole
officer in half an hour.

457
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,516
(Breathes deeply)

458
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:49,035
(Door opens)
Oh, God.

459
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,836
Oh.

460
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:52,438
I think he's coming
over here.

461
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:55,758
(Murmuring)

462
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,728
I'm Huck.

463
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:02,464
I brought you all here
to dig up some dirt

464
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:03,932
on the Reston campaign...

465
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,101
Disgruntled ex-girlfriends,
old coworkers...

466
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:08,553
Whatever we can find.
The dirtier, the better.

467
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:10,255
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
- So this is politics, huh?

468
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,957
(Olivia) - What about
Mrs. Reston's accounts?

469
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,990
(Huck) Clean.

470
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:14,576
(Abby) So have you known
the restons a long time?

471
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:16,645
(Harrison) Talk to me.
What haven't they uncovered?

472
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,214
He was a rager. Crashed his car into
a tree after a Christmas party.

473
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:20,982
Excellent.
The only witness is a loyal,

474
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:22,100
and there's
no public record, so...

475
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:23,735
So dead intel.
Abby?

476
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:25,453
He was a man-whore.
With a temper.

477
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:29,223
- How bad? - He had a bevy of
pi-phis at his Beck and call.

478
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:30,607
Lots of them are still bitter

479
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,076
about his less-than-chivalrous
dating style.

480
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,195
But then he met Joan
and mellowed out.

481
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:35,613
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
Stayed true, as far as I can tell.

482
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:37,598
- When did he meet Joan?
- '87.

483
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:38,866
Around the same time
he quit drinking.

484
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:42,903
You know, perhaps we need
more experienced and...

485
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:44,455
House-trained people
on this.

486
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:46,857
Sir, these people...
No more excuses.

487
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:48,843
If we don't get something on Reston,

488
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:50,494
something that sticks,
we may just as well

489
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:52,296
pull all of our ads, pack up camp.

490
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:54,382
Fitzgerald can't pull this
off on his own.

491
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,999
You know it and I know it.

492
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:59,269
(Projector and
camera shutter clicks)

493
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:01,588
We put all the lipstick
we can on this pig.

494
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:03,356
It's time to pony up
and seriously consider

495
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:05,742
all the options.
There are no options, Hollis.

496
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:08,428
Yes, there are.
I'm not saying I agree with it,

497
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:10,246
but we should discuss it.

498
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:12,432
(Lowered voice) Election rigging
is not an option.

499
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:15,851
(Lowered voice) I'm talking
about doing a patriotic thing.

500
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,486
You're not serious.

501
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:19,055
I may be a son of a bitch,
but Fitz is clean as a whistle.

502
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,156
Am I right, Cyrus?

503
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,944
He's the real deal.

504
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:28,597
A patriot.
A believer.

505
00:20:28,631 --> 00:20:31,316
How rare is that?
How often does that come along?

506
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:33,585
Once in a generation,
if you're lucky.

507
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:35,404
I'm just saying,
this is our chance

508
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:38,757
to put a man with integrity
inside that big white house.

509
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:42,811
So you want to do this
because Fitz is so good? Really?

510
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:46,114
Doesn't matter why I want to do it.

511
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:48,016
It matters why you'd want to.

512
00:20:50,403 --> 00:20:51,870
What are we talking about?

513
00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:55,206
(Normal voice) Nothing.

514
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:57,709
(Normal voice)
Pull up a chair, Mellie.

515
00:20:57,743 --> 00:20:59,094
Let's have a discussion.

516
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:10,814
Fitz is out on his feet.
He's weak,

517
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:12,516
has trouble concentrating,
plain as day.

518
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:14,234
Presiding over a national
security crisis...

519
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:15,652
It's damn near treason.

520
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:17,988
- He's nixed the air strikes.
- Ooh. He's what?

521
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:19,739
Do I bring him
before congress,

522
00:21:19,774 --> 00:21:21,525
expose his unfitness
to the American people?

523
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,426
No. No.
You do nothing.

524
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:25,295
Just let him hang himself
with his own lasso.

525
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:26,763
Mulish pridefulness
about provin' himself

526
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:28,181
has always been
that boy's Achilles' heel

527
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:29,633
goin' back to him
and his daddy.

528
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,051
All you got to do
is lay back, be set,

529
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:33,620
step in once he crashes
and burns.

530
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:36,072
Your dad is helping.

531
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:38,207
The numbers are giving you
good news.

532
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:39,792
- Although...
- Although?

533
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:43,312
You're still 7 points down
overall.

534
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,748
(Groans)

535
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,634
Come on!

536
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:51,436
How was this not fixed earlier?
You!

537
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:53,021
You have done this before, right?

538
00:21:53,056 --> 00:21:54,957
This is not your first time
plugging in a microphone?

539
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:57,960
We did hire someone who knows
how to do this job, right?!

540
00:21:57,994 --> 00:22:00,028
Governor.
That's Jason.

541
00:22:00,063 --> 00:22:01,930
And he's almost done fixing
the sound system.

542
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:03,932
- He just needs a minute.
- This is a town hall forum.

543
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:05,751
You got people spread
all around the room,

544
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:07,953
and I cannot hear
what they are saying!

545
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:11,288
What's the point of a debate
prep if I can't debate?

546
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:13,541
Everyone, good work.
But let's call it a night.

547
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:14,726
(Sighs)
Go home, get some sleep.

548
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,744
We'll start here again
at 7:00 A.M.

549
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:19,581
Not you.

550
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,334
Those people are working
their butts off for you.

551
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:25,302
- Then we need better people.
- Or we need a better candidate.

552
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,437
Screw you.

553
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:28,322
I am getting killed
in these debates.

554
00:22:28,373 --> 00:22:30,608
I lose votes in these debates.
I need to be prepared.

555
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,794
Which is what we were doing when
you started yelling at people.

556
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:34,378
I am yelling because no
one is doing their job.

557
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:36,531
- Your job is to make sure I win.
- Good.

558
00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:40,667
I was worried you thought
my job is to get felt up

559
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:42,218
in elevators
by my drunken candidate.

560
00:22:42,253 --> 00:22:43,703
I'm sorry about that.
You know I'm sorry about that.

561
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,572
- Do you even want this?
- What?

562
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:47,290
Do you even want
to be President?

563
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:48,692
Obviously.

564
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:50,660
Is it obvious?
I'm running.

565
00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:52,529
You're running like
you're being chased.

566
00:22:52,563 --> 00:22:54,264
You're not running like you want
to cross the finish line first,

567
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:56,933
and so I'm asking you,
do you want it?

568
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:59,786
Or are you just wasting
everyone's time

569
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,406
and money and energy and
faith and hopes and dreams?!

570
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:04,808
- I want it.
- Why?

571
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,176
- Liv. - Why do you want
to be the President?

572
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,344
Okay, Olivia.
Why?!

573
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:08,928
I don't know what you
want me to say!

574
00:23:08,963 --> 00:23:11,681
That's your problem.
You're always trying to say

575
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:12,949
what you think
everyone wants to hear,

576
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:14,584
be what you think everyone
wants you to be,

577
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,885
and I should have caught it before.

578
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,788
I would have if we weren't...
(Sighs)

579
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:23,426
I know you...

580
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,161
Because you let me know you.

581
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,631
But America has no idea
who you are,

582
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:31,800
because you've never let them
know who you are.

583
00:23:31,835 --> 00:23:33,302
Nobody can tell you
how to do that.

584
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:35,604
I can't fix that, because
I'm not running for President.

585
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:37,439
Neither is Cyrus,
neither is your father,

586
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,757
so who are <i>you,</i>

587
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,494
and why do <i>you</i>
want to be President?

588
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,680
Mellie came to me.
I tried to stop it, but...

589
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,682
(Sighs) He's Fitz.

590
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,051
He'll look okay on tv, but...

591
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:51,320
- What? - The man is supposed
to be in the hospital,

592
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:54,189
and instead he's been
working all day.

593
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:57,176
(Lowered voice) I don't think
he'll last on his feet

594
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,578
more than 30 seconds.
You have to shut this down.

595
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:04,917
(Indistinct conversations)

596
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:06,819
(Door closes)

597
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,921
I hear someone
is being stubborn.

598
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:11,439
Cyrus sent you.

599
00:24:11,457 --> 00:24:13,358
It might not be wise to
answer questions on live tv

600
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:14,976
in your condition.

601
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,045
It might not be wise,
but that's what I'm gonna do.

602
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,764
Mind telling me why?

603
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:22,033
What you said.

604
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:23,651
I'm stubborn.

605
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:29,974
(Exhales)

606
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,811
(Exhales and chuckles)

607
00:24:35,464 --> 00:24:36,748
(Exhales)

608
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:40,884
- You almost died.
- Yes.

609
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:43,019
- Don't do it again.
- Okay.

610
00:24:48,426 --> 00:24:50,227
(Kisses)

611
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:52,379
(Sighs)

612
00:24:52,413 --> 00:24:54,080
You can't do
this press conference.

613
00:24:54,114 --> 00:24:56,733
You're not strong enough...
Not yet.

614
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:58,985
I'm doing the press conference.

615
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,405
Tell me why. Tell me why
it's so important to you.

616
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:03,857
(Groans softly)

617
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:09,312
This is <i>my</i> office.

618
00:25:09,347 --> 00:25:11,214
I'm the President.

619
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:14,100
They can shoot me
if they want to,

620
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:15,868
but I'm not going anywhere,
because the people

621
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:17,386
of this country elected
me to this office,

622
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:20,256
and the people deserve to see me
and to know that I'm in charge.

623
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,324
(Knock on door)

624
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:26,929
(Door opens and closes)

625
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:29,265
Well?

626
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:32,084
He's doing the press conference...

627
00:25:32,102 --> 00:25:33,469
Live.

628
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,372
And he's going to take
questions.

629
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:38,424
And it's gonna be great.

630
00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:40,826
And it's gonna be great.

631
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,261
(Exhales)

632
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,964
Reston's narrative is that
he was an angry young man

633
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:53,333
until meeting his wife Joan,
who turned him into

634
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:55,268
the upstanding
public servant he is today.

635
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:58,038
Turns out it wasn't love
that fixed him.

636
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,956
- It was Prozac.
- Hmm.

637
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,457
(Projector and camera shutter clicks)

638
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:03,209
- But this isn't Reston's.
- We pulled it from his trash.

639
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:05,328
His doctors hide it
under a bunch of fake names,

640
00:26:05,362 --> 00:26:07,329
but they all lead back
to Samuel Montrose Reston.

641
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:09,398
Fluoxetine.
60 milligrams a day.

642
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:11,784
For the past 20 years.
That's a pretty heavy habit.

643
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:14,437
My suggestion, if we choose
to go forward with this,

644
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:16,455
is to leak rumors
of prescription drug abuse

645
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:17,907
to the press
before the final debate.

646
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:19,492
It will take over
the news cycle

647
00:26:19,526 --> 00:26:21,410
and prevent Reston from
being able to prepare properly.

648
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:23,545
That's a fine suggestion, honey,

649
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,547
but that's not what
we're gonna do.

650
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:28,133
We're gonna sit on it
until the debate itself.

651
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,085
And then you're gonna work it
into one of your answers

652
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:32,754
and blindside Reston
and send him up a creek

653
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:35,641
without a paddle
and demolish him in the process.

654
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:38,176
(Olivia) - Ahh.
(Jerry chuckles) - Huh?

655
00:26:38,928 --> 00:26:40,895
If you need a rest or don't
know the answer to a question,

656
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,181
take a sip of water.
This is a press conference.

657
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:44,916
This is a town hall-style debate...

658
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,284
Real Americans
with real questions

659
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:47,952
looking to you for real answers.
Put them...

660
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:50,655
at ease. This isn't about
military strategy.

661
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:51,906
It's about convincing
the American people

662
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:54,258
that their commander-in-chief
is not just back,

663
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,293
but up to the job.

664
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:58,028
So I wait for a question
about the military?

665
00:26:58,062 --> 00:26:59,546
That's when you drop the bomb.

666
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:00,948
Give them a choice
between a candidate

667
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:02,349
who's flown combat missions

668
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:03,884
and a candidate who takes
antidepressants.

669
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:06,870
Got it?
Got it?

670
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:07,988
Fitz?

671
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:09,239
I got it.

672
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:10,774
Good.

673
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:14,710
Now show them who you are.

674
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:17,965
(Indistinct conversations)

675
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:23,904
(Applause)

676
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:33,030
(Camera shutters clicking)

677
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:36,116
At 5:00 this evening
eastern standard time,

678
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:40,270
a U.S. Navy S.E.A.L.team
parachuted into east Sudan

679
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:44,640
and captured its President,
Nijam Kinyazi.

680
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:46,325
(Reston)
The Governor's posturing, Carl.

681
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,659
He wants you to believe
that he's trustworthy,

682
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:49,011
that he's his father.

683
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:51,113
He's not his father.
His father was a self-made man.

684
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:52,798
The Governor...
he was made

685
00:27:52,832 --> 00:27:54,633
on a boarding school assembly line.

686
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,218
He can't relate to you.
(Camera shutter clicks)

687
00:27:56,252 --> 00:27:57,903
(Reporters shouting questions)
(Under breath) Here we go.

688
00:27:57,921 --> 00:27:59,605
- Yes, Carol?
- What were the casualties?

689
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:02,657
- None on our side.
- And theirs?

690
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:03,592
I don't have numbers
for you yet,

691
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:05,444
but I'm told there were
several, all non-civilian.

692
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:08,179
(Reporters shouting questions)
Yeah. Peter?

693
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:11,014
Having just survived
an assassination attempt,

694
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:12,750
is there any concern
about P.T.S.D.

695
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:16,437
or impaired brain functioning that
<i>could</i> affect your judgment?

696
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:21,542
(Shutters clicking)

697
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,978
(Reporters murmuring)

698
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:25,980
Oh, boy.

699
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:29,533
(Clicking continues)

700
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,436
(Moderator) The next question
is for Governor Grant,

701
00:28:33,454 --> 00:28:35,504
and it's from Jessica Moran.

702
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:37,240
- Jessica.
- Governor Grant...

703
00:28:37,274 --> 00:28:38,291
Hi, Jessica.

704
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,210
As the mother
of an 18-year-old boy

705
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:43,079
who's about to enlist
in the army,

706
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:46,249
why should I trust you
as our next commander-in-chief?

707
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:47,784
(Under breath) This is it.

708
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:49,702
You know, people talk
about a lack of patriotism

709
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:51,221
in our country.

710
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:53,856
They're wrong.

711
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,308
And your son is proof of that.

712
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:59,244
Now, as for whether
you should trust me

713
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,963
as commander-in-chief...

714
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:02,297
Say it.

715
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:04,666
(Chuckles)

716
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,668
What I should say

717
00:29:06,686 --> 00:29:09,121
is that I've served
in the military,

718
00:29:09,155 --> 00:29:11,806
and I've flown combat missions,

719
00:29:11,824 --> 00:29:13,659
and the courage that I exhibited

720
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:15,677
makes me fit
to lead this country.

721
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,763
That's what I should say,

722
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,649
because my pollsters
and aides and advisors

723
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:22,334
tell me that's what you
want to hear.

724
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:23,752
What the hell's he doing?

725
00:29:23,786 --> 00:29:25,737
But the truth is, Jessica...

726
00:29:25,772 --> 00:29:28,924
Those years I spent
in the Navy...

727
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,909
It wasn't courage I felt.

728
00:29:31,744 --> 00:29:34,062
It was fear.

729
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:35,880
Fear that I'd crash.

730
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:39,317
Fear that the life
that I wanted to live

731
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:43,337
would end in a ball of flames
a million Miles from home.

732
00:29:43,372 --> 00:29:47,175
It literally made me sick.

733
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:50,745
Now does that mean
that I am not fit

734
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:53,715
to be commander-in-chief?

735
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:55,383
(Camera shutter clicks)

736
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:56,584
(Projector clicks)

737
00:29:56,618 --> 00:29:59,504
(Camera shutters clicking)

738
00:30:00,938 --> 00:30:02,105
No.

739
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:05,758
In fact, I've never felt
more ready.

740
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:07,594
Weakness is our strength.

741
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:08,878
(Camera shutters clicking)

742
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:11,664
It's what makes us human.

743
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:14,867
- It's where our compassion
comes from. - I don't believe this.

744
00:30:14,902 --> 00:30:16,402
Our humility.

745
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:19,705
All qualities that make for
a great commander-in-chief.

746
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,809
You can't have someone
protect you

747
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:25,210
if they don't know
what you're afraid of.

748
00:30:25,244 --> 00:30:27,646
I know what you're afraid of.

749
00:30:27,664 --> 00:30:29,982
I know what
your son's afraid of.

750
00:30:30,017 --> 00:30:31,901
Why?

751
00:30:31,935 --> 00:30:33,986
Because I'm afraid of it, too.

752
00:30:34,021 --> 00:30:35,721
(Applause)

753
00:30:35,756 --> 00:30:36,973
(Jessica) Thank you.

754
00:30:39,424 --> 00:30:40,659
Works for me.

755
00:30:40,693 --> 00:30:43,328
- Grant the protector.
- Yeah.

756
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:46,164
Pull the file on Reston's stint
as Baltimore D.A.

757
00:30:46,182 --> 00:30:48,283
- We're painting him as soft on crime.
- Yeah.

758
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:50,736
(Applause,
camera shutters clicking)

759
00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:52,938
(Fitz) Good night.

760
00:30:58,894 --> 00:31:01,011
You knocked it
out of the park, sir.

761
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:02,680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

762
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:04,665
(Laughs)

763
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:06,934
So that's how you're gonna
win this thing, huh?

764
00:31:06,968 --> 00:31:09,320
By taking out a hankie
and crying?

765
00:31:09,354 --> 00:31:12,056
She teed it up for you
and you whiffed.

766
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,757
(Scoffs)

767
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:17,912
I know that I've won
fewer elections than you.

768
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:19,530
But not because you were
better than me,

769
00:31:19,548 --> 00:31:20,998
because you are not.

770
00:31:21,016 --> 00:31:22,933
You are a petty man.
You are an underhanded man.

771
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:25,669
You are a small man,
and I don't want to be you,

772
00:31:25,704 --> 00:31:27,938
not now, not ever.

773
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:29,640
You're gonna lose
this election,

774
00:31:29,674 --> 00:31:31,642
and it's gonna be
the end of this

775
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,744
so-called career of yours.

776
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:36,697
You're not cut out to lead.

777
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:38,649
You never were.

778
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:42,169
And I may be petty or whatever
else you want to call me,

779
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:44,488
but I'm a winner.

780
00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:48,676
And that's something
you'll never be.

781
00:31:53,365 --> 00:31:54,831
(Chuckles)

782
00:31:57,852 --> 00:31:59,687
(Gate clatters)

783
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:10,840
Mr. President,
if I could have a word.

784
00:32:10,874 --> 00:32:13,676
You're gonna need to move
this stuff out of here, Sally.

785
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,962
Of course. I'll send someone
right away.

786
00:32:18,013 --> 00:32:19,681
What do you need?

787
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:21,365
I just wanted
to congratulate you

788
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:22,851
on kinyazi.

789
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:25,553
I didn't think a S.E.A.L. team
was the way to go. I was wrong.

790
00:32:25,604 --> 00:32:27,372
These things don't always
break your way.

791
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:29,057
This time it did.

792
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:30,825
I always wanted
to give you this.

793
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:36,798
It's a copy of my letter
accepting your reinstatement.

794
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:38,783
When I questioned
your readiness to serve,

795
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:40,085
I was just thinking
about our country,

796
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,602
where it would leave us,

797
00:32:41,637 --> 00:32:43,054
how it would make us look
to the world.

798
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:46,140
I wasn't rooting for you
to fail or die.

799
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:47,725
The truth is,
your getting shot

800
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,411
was the scariest thing
that ever happened to me.

801
00:32:50,445 --> 00:32:53,331
I haven't slept a night
during this whole time.

802
00:32:56,318 --> 00:32:59,537
It is not easy
being President.

803
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,590
Thank you, Sally.

804
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:06,660
You are welcome,
Mr. President.

805
00:33:09,263 --> 00:33:10,947
Got my boy sleeping
with his phone under his pillow.

806
00:33:10,982 --> 00:33:12,883
One call from me,
this election's ours.

807
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:15,652
- No. - We don't use him,
we're gonna lose this thing.

808
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,621
Or maybe you thought that
little math girlie was wrong

809
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:20,139
about how everything's gonna
shake out in Ohio.

810
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,092
I can't <i>believe</i>
we are having this conversation.

811
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,377
- Olivia, let's be practical.
- Mm.

812
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:26,045
- What do you want?
- What?

813
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,297
- What do you want out of this?
- I don't know.

814
00:33:28,331 --> 00:33:30,199
Verna here is gonna be
supreme court justice

815
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:31,566
first time there's a vacancy.

816
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:33,402
Cyrus is gonna be
chief of staff.

817
00:33:33,436 --> 00:33:35,254
Mellie... well, First Lady.

818
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:39,675
And what are you, Hollis?

819
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:41,810
I'm a guy everyone
sitting here owes a favor to.

820
00:33:41,844 --> 00:33:46,115
Olivia, you need to think
about your future and decide...

821
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,783
What do you want?

822
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:53,255
- It has to be unanimous.
- Cyrus...

823
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:56,492
No, the only way we trust each other
is if everybody's ass is on the line.

824
00:33:56,526 --> 00:33:58,826
If it's not unanimous,
we don't do it.

825
00:33:58,827 --> 00:34:00,478
Then we don't do it.

826
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:04,899
(Sighs)

827
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:09,303
Governor?

828
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,988
Fitz, you all right?

829
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:15,810
My father had a heart attack
and died 20 minutes ago.

830
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,505
(Projector
and camera shutter clicks)

831
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,496
It was a very nice funeral.

832
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:41,368
I liked what you said
about your father.

833
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:43,337
It was a lie.

834
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:46,073
The story about the dog
he got me for my 10th birthday,

835
00:34:46,107 --> 00:34:48,542
I made it up.

836
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:50,511
'Cause you can't get up
at your father's funeral

837
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:53,947
and tell the story about how
you sat outside his office door

838
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:56,533
on your 10th birthday and...

839
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,452
listened to him
bang his secretary.

840
00:34:58,486 --> 00:34:59,486
(Grunts)

841
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:01,655
(Exhales)

842
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:04,992
I'm not sad.

843
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:07,578
I'm relieved.

844
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:11,648
I'm free.

845
00:35:11,683 --> 00:35:13,951
(Wood clatters)
(Grunts)

846
00:35:15,203 --> 00:35:17,871
And I want it, Liv.
(Axe clatters)

847
00:35:17,906 --> 00:35:20,073
I want to win this election.

848
00:35:20,808 --> 00:35:22,809
I'm going to win.

849
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:26,462
It's mine.

850
00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:31,183
Do you think I'll make
a good President?

851
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:36,939
I think you'll make
a <i>great</i> President.

852
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:00,913
Put down the axe.

853
00:36:00,947 --> 00:36:02,381
Put it down!

854
00:36:02,415 --> 00:36:03,465
(Wood clatters)

855
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,737
Come here.

856
00:36:33,913 --> 00:36:36,715
(Stifled crying)

857
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:38,600
(Sobs)

858
00:36:38,635 --> 00:36:42,154
(Sobbing)

859
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:46,358
(Continues sobbing)

860
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:56,449
I'm changing my locks.

861
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:57,567
I wanted to talk to you,

862
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:58,701
and I didn't want
to wait in the hall.

863
00:36:58,735 --> 00:37:00,369
We're done talking.
(Keys clatter)

864
00:37:00,403 --> 00:37:03,022
I've been thinking about this.
Everything.

865
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,407
And you were right.

866
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:06,109
It was sexist to suggest

867
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:07,744
that you were in a relationship
with the President.

868
00:37:07,778 --> 00:37:10,363
I was to wrong to think
that there was a conspiracy,

869
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:13,032
that someone forged
the President's signature.

870
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:16,152
I'm sorry.

871
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:17,587
I was wrong.

872
00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:21,958
You forget that
I know <i>you</i> too well.

873
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:27,547
And so I know
when you are lying, Edison.

874
00:37:31,285 --> 00:37:33,519
I love you.

875
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:36,355
I am <i>in</i> love with you,

876
00:37:36,406 --> 00:37:38,206
and I don't care
what you've done,

877
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,242
who you've loved...
I don't care.

878
00:37:40,276 --> 00:37:42,511
And if you will have me,

879
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:45,147
I would very much
like to marry you.

880
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,985
(Groans)
You were incredible today.

881
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,587
I've never seen anything
like it.

882
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:55,323
That press conference was flawless.
(Groans)

883
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:56,708
Struck just the right tone.

884
00:37:56,742 --> 00:38:00,127
Presidential. Strong.
Everything. Back to normal.

885
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:02,262
(Sighs) I was worried,
I have to admit.

886
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,732
I was very worried.
Something like this happens...

887
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:06,200
a shooting or an accident...

888
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:08,802
You remember senator Hutchins.
He was in that car accident.

889
00:38:08,837 --> 00:38:11,355
Now he's quadriplegic,
and his poor wife...

890
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,207
She has to change his diapers.
(Groans softly)

891
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,575
I can't even imagine.

892
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:16,710
Your life can change in an instant.

893
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:19,363
<i>We</i> were lucky.

894
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,465
You're back. You're you.

895
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,033
That is...

896
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:26,370
To have our life go back
to the way it was...

897
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,672
Is a gift.

898
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,624
Everything's good.
I'm grateful.

899
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:32,710
I'm so grateful.

900
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:36,080
And... honestly?

901
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:39,265
Your approval rating
has never been higher.

902
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,434
You can have anything
you want right now.

903
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,186
Anything.
We should think about that.

904
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,439
We should take advantage
of this moment politically.

905
00:38:46,473 --> 00:38:48,675
But we have to be
smart about it.

906
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:51,694
What do you think?
What do you want?

907
00:38:53,163 --> 00:38:56,082
If <i>you</i> could have anything...

908
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:02,972
I want a divorce.

909
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:07,409
You're telling me
that even though

910
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:09,161
there are 120 million people
voting in this thing,

911
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:10,595
all we care about is Ohio?

912
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,963
Our problem isn't Ohio.

913
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:14,416
Our problem is Franklin,
Summit, and Defiance.

914
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,201
You're right.
Take out those three counties,

915
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:18,103
and this election
is a statistical dead heat.

916
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:19,988
It could go either way.

917
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,807
Painting Reston as soft
on crime has been a godsend.

918
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:23,859
There isn't any crime
in Defiance?

919
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,094
I just do the math.
(Papers thud)

920
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:29,347
(Telephone ringing in distance)

921
00:39:29,365 --> 00:39:31,466
I don't know how you can
even consider...

922
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:33,819
It isn't my idea. Hollis...

923
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:35,137
Hollis is your guy.

924
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:37,456
Hollis is Fitz's guy.

925
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,659
Let's not play innocent here.

926
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:44,328
Fitz is clean.
Fitz walks on water.

927
00:39:44,363 --> 00:39:46,797
Fitz makes the fishes
and the loaves.

928
00:39:46,832 --> 00:39:49,016
And people like Hollis
and me and you...

929
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:50,217
(Scoffs)

930
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:53,071
Don't roll your eyes.

931
00:39:53,105 --> 00:39:55,940
You're one of us, Olivia.

932
00:39:55,974 --> 00:39:58,793
We march behind him.

933
00:39:59,427 --> 00:40:01,161
We sing his happy tune.

934
00:40:01,196 --> 00:40:03,030
And then we pick up
our hatchets,

935
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:05,883
and we chop up the judases
into bloody little pieces

936
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:10,354
and dance around their corpses,
because that is our job.

937
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:14,575
That is what we do.
We take care of Fitz.

938
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:17,210
And we don't do it
because we are believers,

939
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:18,796
which we are.

940
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,831
We don't do it for the rush
or the high or the power,

941
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:23,650
which we are most
certainly junkies for.

942
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:27,320
We do it because Fitz can't.
He can't do it.

943
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:30,724
If he could do it, we wouldn't
worship at his altar.

944
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:35,145
People like Fitz...
They go down in history.

945
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:39,949
People like us, we create the history.
(Breath quavering)

946
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:43,869
We run this world
so he can lead it.

947
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,423
In order to lead it, the people
have to elect him, Cyrus.

948
00:40:47,457 --> 00:40:48,924
The people have to find him worthy.

949
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:50,793
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

950
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:53,479
The way this world works,

951
00:40:53,513 --> 00:40:55,765
the people is you and me

952
00:40:55,799 --> 00:40:57,867
and Hollis and Mellie and Verna.
(Breathing heavily)

953
00:40:57,901 --> 00:40:59,718
- We're the people.
- Cy...

954
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,837
No. It comes down
to two questions, Olivia...

955
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:04,573
does he deserve to be President?

956
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:06,709
And if you believe he does,

957
00:41:06,743 --> 00:41:08,928
do you think he can win it on his own?

958
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:12,331
If you can say "yes" to both,

959
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:15,551
then we'll never discuss
election rigging...

960
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:17,486
Ever again.

961
00:41:26,229 --> 00:41:28,730
Do you think I'll make
a good President?

962
00:41:28,731 --> 00:41:29,831
He's the real deal.

963
00:41:29,832 --> 00:41:32,233
- Once in a generation.
- You're gonna lose this election.

964
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:33,651
<i>Do you think I'll make</i>
<i>a good President?</i>

965
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:34,986
Fitzgerald can't pull this
off on his own.

966
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:36,254
- I gotta win this election.
- What do you want?

967
00:41:36,305 --> 00:41:37,855
- It's mine.
- <i>Think about your future.</i>

968
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,540
- I'm going to win...
- I'm a winner.

969
00:41:39,575 --> 00:41:41,542
- ...this election.
- That's something you'll never be.

970
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,794
It's mine.

971
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:48,900
(Cyrus) It's a finite number
of people, Mellie.

972
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:50,251
- That's all I'm saying.
- Cyrus, we are all working

973
00:41:50,268 --> 00:41:51,368
as hard as we can work.

974
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:52,536
I know.
I know that.

975
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,020
So we tell them they just...
(Speaks indistinctly)

976
00:41:54,038 --> 00:41:55,505
Yes.

977
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,274
Yes?

978
00:41:58,876 --> 00:42:00,410
So you're...

979
00:42:00,445 --> 00:42:02,329
In.

980
00:42:08,336 --> 00:42:10,870
(Beep)

981
00:42:10,888 --> 00:42:12,689
(Clears throat)

982
00:42:15,944 --> 00:42:17,561
It's a go.
