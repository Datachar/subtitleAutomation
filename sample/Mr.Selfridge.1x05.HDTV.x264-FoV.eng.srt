1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
You don't steal
from your work family!

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,240
I'm so sorry, Mr Selfridge.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,440
I don't see the Selfridge's
livery on the side.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,240
It's always you that loads it?
I do what Alfie and Sam tell me.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,480
You're a shop girl.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,040
Lost your job, have you? You've done
your damage. What more do you want?

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,720
I am Selfridge.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,560
You knew I was falling
in love with you.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,560
Was it revenge for Ellen Love,
was that it?

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,480
Your contract with Selfridge's
is over.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,200
I don't see your wife anywhere!

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,880
My wife is not your concern.
Goodbye, Ellen.

13
00:00:29,979 --> 00:01:00,427

<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

14
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:03,282
This seems a rather expensive
enterprise, Mr Selfridge.

15
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:06,402
It will more than pay for itself.
How will we get it in the window?

16
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,642
Don't worry about that.
Henri's an old hand.

17
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:10,842
We'll dismantle it
and then put it together.

18
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:14,862
My God! It worked like a dream
for us at Marshall Field.

19
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:16,671
But back then,

20
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:21,071
there were only 1,500 registered
drivers in the whole of Chicago.

21
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:26,151
In London today, there are over
36,000. They'll come, they'll see,

22
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:28,991
they'll walk inside
and they'll buy the products.

23
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,871
Isn't she a beauty?

24
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:34,551
This automobile is not insured
for anyone to drive.

25
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:36,791
Not even you, Mr Selfridge.

26
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:38,831
Ah!

27
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:41,191
What do you think?

28
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,871
Magnificent!
How is the window shaping up?

29
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:46,871
"Motoring for the Modern Age!"

30
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:49,511
Well, I miss Agnes Towler's
keen eye.

31
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:51,351
So get her to work with you.

32
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,071
I can't. She's gone.

33
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,751
Gone?

34
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,911
What? Didn't you know?

35
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:02,031
After that business with her father,
she has left.

36
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:08,111
Well, at least
George is still in work.

37
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,071
Without his wages,
I don't know where we'd be.

38
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:15,471
You'll look out for him, won't you?
Course I will.

39
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:19,551
My dad's come back.

40
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:21,271
I thought you'd changed the locks?

41
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:26,511
He turned up last night, drunk,
passed out on the stairs.

42
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:29,311
My landlady told me
if I didn't get him out of the way,

43
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,871
that we'd all be out.
We'll have to work out something.

44
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:34,911
He can't stay here forever.
I've been thinking...

45
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:36,991
maybe it's not so bad
you left your job.

46
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,431
What?
Well, for you and me.

47
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:42,431
We can go out together now.

48
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:45,151
How about we go down
to Brighton this weekend?

49
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:48,151
Brighton? What would we do there?

50
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:53,351
Walk on the beach, go down the pier,
hold hands in the moonlight.

51
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:56,711
I know you're trying to cheer me up,
but I'm not in the mood.

52
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:59,471
I'm asking if I can court you.

53
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:01,631
That's what I'm doing!

54
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,471
Oh, I see.

55
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,511
Hadn't it crossed your mind at all?

56
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,391
Not really.

57
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:12,711
Well, maybe a bit...

58
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:15,871
A bit?
Well, I suppose that's a start.

59
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,791
I like you, Victor, you know I do.

60
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:23,511
But I'm more trouble than I'm worth.

61
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:27,911
What with George and my dad,
and me without a job.

62
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:31,831
You don't want to court me.

63
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,951
I do. More than anything.

64
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,071
Are you my girl then?

65
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:51,391
I think I must be.

66
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:17,511
Miss Towler available?
I always deal with Miss Towler!

67
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:20,191
I can't imagine wearing
that over my face.

68
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:23,231
Keeps the flies out of your mouth,
I suppose.

69
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,191
Lady Carlyle's here, Miss Mardle.

70
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:28,991
She wants to see all the
motoring gloves that we've got.

71
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:31,111
Well, show them to her!

72
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,431
She's asking for Miss Towler.

73
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:36,231
Tell her Miss Towler has left,
but you can help her.

74
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:38,351
Shoulders back, good diction.

75
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:49,151
Those are the most supple leather
we have, Lady Carlyle.

76
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:54,511
The abrasions on the palm allow the
driver to grip the steering wheel.

77
00:04:57,191 --> 00:05:00,191
What are we to say to customers
about Agnes, Miss Mardle?

78
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:03,591
You'll be courteous and assist them
with whatever they are looking for.

79
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:05,391
Now get on with your work, Doris.

80
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:08,991
It must say 'Motoring',
at a glance. What do you have?

81
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:10,951
This is the Dorothy Levitt blazer,

82
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:12,871
inspired by the great motorist
herself.

83
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:17,671
A woman could wear this anywhere,

84
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,151
walking, bicycling,
even to a garden party. No?

85
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,391
I have just the coat.

86
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:27,311
It's new in.

87
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:35,871
It also comes in leather.

88
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:39,591
A lady in leather -
does that appeal, Mr Leclair?

89
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,111
Very much, Miss Ravillious.

90
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:44,391
Leather is good, thank you.

91
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,431
Do you have an appointment
to see Mrs Selfridge?

92
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:50,231
She'll see me.
Just tell her I'm here.

93
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:52,071
Rose!

94
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:53,911
Rose!

95
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:55,951
Mrs Selfridge.
It's alright, Fraser.

96
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:59,311
Apologies, Mr Temple. I'd forgotten
that I was expecting you.

97
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:01,911
I see you've brought the painting.
Please, come in.

98
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,111
What are you doing here?

99
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:18,631
Look, I, erm... I came to apologise
for the other day.

100
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:21,351
I was rude to you and...

101
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:25,431
Well, I've been feeling awful
about it.

102
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:29,991
I'm sorry too. I shouldn't
have lied about who I was.

103
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:32,431
No.

104
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,951
Friends?

105
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:37,191
Mm. It depends.

106
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,111
On what?

107
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,351
On this!
Come on, I'm dying to see it!

108
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:45,671
Can I?
Yes. Please...

109
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,631
I can't believe you've finished it!

110
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:57,231
What do you think?

111
00:06:57,271 --> 00:07:00,351
It's nothing like
you've done before.

112
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,751
I told you, you inspire me.

113
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,751
It's good. It's really good.

114
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,871
Thank you.

115
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:13,831
Harry will like it.

116
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:15,791
I don't want him to have it.

117
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:17,511
Don't you see?

118
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:20,471
Now you've brought it into the
house, I have to give it to him.

119
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:23,391
I have responsibilities and
I've been pretending I haven't -

120
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:25,151
Your husband neglects you.

121
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:28,711
No, I love him and...

122
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:31,311
he loves me too, in his own way.

123
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,631
Not like I could.

124
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,751
Who are you?

125
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,871
Erm... I'm a friend of
your mother's.

126
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:02,911
This is Mr Temple, and...
he's been painting my picture.

127
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:06,431
I'm gonna give it to Pa
as a present.

128
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:10,631
Your painting!

129
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:13,871
Yes, I used to paint,
before you came along.

130
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:17,871
Now, run along to Grandma.
I'm just gonna see Mr Temple out.

131
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:21,511
Oh, and Beatrice darling, erm...

132
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:24,751
don't tell anyone about this.

133
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:27,631
It's a surprise.

134
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:41,151
Oh no!

135
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:42,911
Will she say anything?

136
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:45,431
I don't know. You have to go.

137
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,431
You have to go!

138
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,231
I can't.

139
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:58,911
You're not a conventional person
at heart.

140
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:03,151
Don't stifle your true self.
This may be your last chance.

141
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:10,231
No...

142
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,071
No.

143
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:17,151
You'll see me again.

144
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,311
You can depend on that.

145
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,720
How fast does it go?

146
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:43,248
Forty, fifty miles an hour.

147
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:44,928
When you're behind the wheel
of one of these,

148
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:48,193
you feel like you're going so fast,
that nothing can touch you.

149
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,313
Wow! I wanna drive one.
You will one day.

150
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:52,033
Uh-oh!

151
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,753
We've been spotted, Gordon!

152
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,993
Be brave, prepare for....

153
00:09:57,753 --> 00:09:59,433
Come here, you!

154
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:03,113
I've got a secret
that I can't tell you.

155
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,673
You do? Well, I'm gonna
tickle it out of you! Come on!

156
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:07,393
What is it?

157
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,353
What time is it? Is it late?

158
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:29,753
Harry, you shouldn't have opened it.

159
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:31,473
It was a present for you.

160
00:10:31,513 --> 00:10:33,753
I didn't realise
that you missed painting.

161
00:10:33,793 --> 00:10:36,593
Yeah, I don't think
I realised it either.

162
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:40,113
Who's the artist?

163
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:44,833
He's called Roderick Temple.

164
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:50,353
He caught you well.
Where did you meet him?

165
00:10:50,393 --> 00:10:52,153
At the National Gallery.

166
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,353
And where did he paint you?

167
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:58,433
In his studio.

168
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:03,473
Harry, he's just a boy.

169
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:06,593
If I'd considered it at all
inappropriate to be painted by him,

170
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,353
I wouldn't have gone ahead with it!

171
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:10,513
I thought you could
hang it in your office,

172
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:12,233
on the wall opposite your desk.

173
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,713
But if you don't like it...

174
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:19,593
I just wish I'd known, that's all.

175
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:22,233
If you had, it wouldn't have been
a surprise, would it?

176
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:28,473
You know I value you,
more than anything.

177
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:31,393
Yes Harry, I know that.

178
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:35,673
Where are you off to so early?

179
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:38,313
There's something I need to do.

180
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,473
I got it.

181
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,193
Wait right here for me, thank you.

182
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:58,233
Give me money! Give me money!
Oh, is that the biggest one?

183
00:11:58,273 --> 00:12:00,953
There we go. You had the money
the whole time, right there!

184
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:03,153
Ha ha! I'm outnumbered!

185
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:33,673
Of course, you'll have to
get yourself another job.

186
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:39,913
I mean, we can't all three of us
live off George's wages.

187
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:44,593
Who are you?

188
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:47,233
The front door was open.
I'm looking for Agnes Towler.

189
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:49,433
We don't accept gentlemen callers.

190
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:56,953
Wait in there.

191
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:13,073
Here, I've got a mate,
and he owns this pub in Poplar,

192
00:13:13,113 --> 00:13:14,953
and he's looking for a bar maid.

193
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:18,953
A bar maid? What's wrong with that?
You're lucky to get the offer.

194
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:25,273
Swell downstairs for you.
I put him in the front parlour.

195
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:33,193
Mr Selfridge!

196
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:34,953
What are... What are you doing here?

197
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,953
I could say the same for you.

198
00:13:38,873 --> 00:13:40,553
Why aren't you at the store?

199
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:44,513
I left. I won't accept it.
I'm here to take you back.

200
00:13:45,473 --> 00:13:47,433
You show great potential.

201
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:50,193
You remind me of myself
when I started out.

202
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:54,513
Grasping for every chance,
keen as mustard to learn.

203
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:56,553
You love it, don't you?

204
00:13:56,593 --> 00:14:00,633
The customers, the selling, the feel
of the merchandise under your hands.

205
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,433
I love it more than anything.

206
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:04,473
That's why I don't wanna lose you.

207
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:08,593
Come back. Who cares what happened
with your father?

208
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:10,313
If you don't, no one else will.

209
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:12,473
But Mr Selfridge, don't you?

210
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:15,033
You're not him.

211
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,353
All the, erm...

212
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:24,873
I can't seem to find my way
out of it, that's the trouble.

213
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:29,593
Every time I try to set myself and
George up without him, he finds us.

214
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,473
Thank you.

215
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:39,433
Is he in the house now?

216
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,913
Let me go talk to him.

217
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:14,793
Who the bloody hell are you?
Harry Gordon Selfridge.

218
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:19,073
I have certain conditions
to put before you.

219
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:22,793
What conditions?
Leave London immediately.

220
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:27,233
Live anywhere you like as long
as it's a good distance from here.

221
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:30,953
Who the hell do you think you are?

222
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:33,953
You come round here,

223
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:39,273
and you think that
you can tell me what to do?

224
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:44,193
This should pay for your travel,

225
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,353
keep food in your stomach
while you look for work.

226
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:51,193
Oh, I get it.

227
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:55,553
You have taken a bit of a shine
to my Aggie.

228
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:59,673
Tell me, has she offered
her services to you?

229
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:02,113
Argh!
Understand me!

230
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:05,353
If you drink your way through this
and end up on the street,

231
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:07,873
you will not return to London
to bother your daughter!

232
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:09,593
You will not contact her,

233
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:12,073
you will not come to my store
and seek her out.

234
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:17,633
I will not let you ruin her life!

235
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:19,353
All right, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

236
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:21,553
Stop! Stop! Please! Stop!

237
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:23,593
Please!

238
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:37,313
Do we have an agreement?

239
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:48,033
Hello, son.

240
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:53,633
'Your pa ain't no war hero.
He ain't dead either!'

241
00:16:53,673 --> 00:16:56,633
'My ma says he's alive
and living in Freemont...'

242
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,553
Pa?

243
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:15,233
Who is that lady, Pa?

244
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:17,993
Why aren't you at home
with Ma and me?

245
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:21,353
Your ma's high-toned bullshit
did it for me,

246
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:23,193
that's why I never came home.

247
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:27,553
But I'm your blood and you're mine,
whether you like it or not...

248
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:31,793
Mr Selfridge? Mr Selfridge?

249
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,513
Mr Selfridge?

250
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,233
Is everything all right?

251
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:51,873
He'll be gone by the time you
get back from work this evening.

252
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,793
What do you mean?
Just what I say - gone.

253
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:00,393
In this type of situations,
it's best to make a clean break.

254
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,633
No fond farewells. You understand?

255
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:07,073
Grab your coat and hat.
I'll give you a ride into the store.

256
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:31,833
Well, did you enjoy the ride?

257
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:34,993
It felt like flying!

258
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:37,953
Who knows?
One day, you may do that as well.

259
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,833
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

260
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:46,633
Now, you remember.
Don't apologise, don't explain.

261
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:49,353
As a tactic, it's always
worked well for me.

262
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:57,153
Thank you.
That's all right.

263
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:11,593
Look!

264
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:14,193
What's she doing back?

265
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,873
Can I help you, Miss Towler?
I've come back, Miss Mardle.

266
00:19:17,913 --> 00:19:20,353
Well, I'm afraid
that's not possible, my dear.

267
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:23,873
It was a mistake.
I didn't hand in my notice.

268
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,233
If you check, I'm still employed
by Selfridge's, by Mr Selfridge.

269
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:31,513
Right, well, I will have to confirm
that with Mr Grove of course.

270
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:33,793
But in the meantime,
we can put you to use.

271
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,513
You can unpack the new stock.

272
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:37,673
We are embarking on
a motor driving promotion

273
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:39,753
and those lap robes
have just come in.

274
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:41,593
Very good, Miss Mardle.

275
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,233
You can't just swan back in.

276
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,433
Looks like I just have.

277
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,953
Miss Towler!
Hello.

278
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,073
You've returned to us.

279
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:00,913
That is wonderful.

280
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:04,433
Welcome back.

281
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,633
George lad.

282
00:20:25,673 --> 00:20:27,913
Give us an 'and over here.
I'll just finish this.

283
00:20:27,953 --> 00:20:29,633
Now!

284
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:40,753
Thank you.

285
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:58,113
Miss Ellen Love,
to see Mrs Selfridge.

286
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:08,433
Miss Love, what a pleasant surprise.

287
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:12,913
I'm afraid this isn't
a social visit, Mrs Selfridge.

288
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:14,873
Oh? What a pity.

289
00:21:14,913 --> 00:21:18,833
Er, please,
can I offer you some coffee?

290
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:25,313
I'm here to tell you
that your husband has not
been faithful to you.

291
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:27,273
He's having an affair with me.

292
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:33,993
Well, I think I'll have some,
anyhow.

293
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,233
Is that all you can say?

294
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:44,873
Well, this news isn't a surprise
to me.

295
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:47,993
I knew from the moment
I first saw you two together.

296
00:21:48,993 --> 00:21:54,113
But the fact that you are here,
telling me about it...

297
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:56,193
Well, that is of interest.

298
00:21:56,233 --> 00:22:00,033
It suggests that
it's almost certainly over.

299
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,513
You're so cold.

300
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:09,633
No wonder Harry looks for
his passions elsewhere.

301
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:12,193
You've got him bad, haven't you?

302
00:22:14,153 --> 00:22:15,833
He loves me.

303
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:17,833
Mm, I very much doubt that.

304
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:20,513
Harry has had many similar liaisons.

305
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,633
You are the latest

306
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:26,753
in a long line of chorus girls.

307
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,593
I'm not a chorus girl!

308
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:32,993
That, I admit, could be
a mistake on my husband's part.

309
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:36,513
Unless there is anything else...

310
00:22:38,713 --> 00:22:41,113
..today is my housekeeping day.

311
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:48,273
Oh, Miss Love was just leaving,
Fraser.

312
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:50,353
And I'll have a coffee please.

313
00:22:56,593 --> 00:22:58,513
Tell him I came.

314
00:22:58,553 --> 00:23:00,953
And I will not be got rid of
that easily.

315
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,490
Is the chief in?

316
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,530
How's his mood?

317
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,970
My mood is just fine, Mr Grove.
Why? What's the problem?

318
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:54,007
Thieving in the loading bay?

319
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:56,287
What the hell
is wrong with this store?

320
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:58,807
Catch them red-handed
and throw them out on their ear.

321
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,527
How did you discover this?

322
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,687
Victor Colleano,
a waiter in the Palm Court,

323
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:04,447
came to me, voiced his suspicions.

324
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:06,247
Well, at least there's some loyalty.

325
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:08,327
I'll deal with it, Mr Selfridge.

326
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:12,767
Oh, and Mr Grove...

327
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:14,807
Miss Towler is back on the pay roll.

328
00:24:14,847 --> 00:24:17,127
But she left.

329
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,087
If she hadn't,
I'd have dismissed her.

330
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:21,047
That would have been a mistake.

331
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:23,207
Her father behaved disgracefully.

332
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:27,287
The parent is not the child.
Not in my store anyway.

333
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:30,527
So am I to allow Miss Bunting
to return,

334
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:32,887
and turn a blind eye to
these loading bay workers?

335
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:34,847
That is different.
They stole from us.

336
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:39,287
The staff will not understand
why she has been allowed to return.

337
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:41,407
Well, then I will explain it.

338
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,167
Call a staff meeting this evening.

339
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:45,207
Let the heads of each department
know.

340
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,607
George, load that stuff
an' all.

341
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:01,327
George, I need to talk to you,
urgent! What are you doing?

342
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:06,167
What are you doing?
It's a fiddle. Don't you get it?

343
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:09,167
Bloody hell!

344
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:13,247
That is the property of Mr Harry
Selfridge! Out on your ear! Get out!

345
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:14,967
I've been loading that van!

346
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:18,007
Don't say anything. If anyone
asks, keep your mouth shut.

347
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:21,847
And I thought Alf was my friend.
I'll be your friend, alright?

348
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:25,127
Thanks, Victor.
But you need to wise up.

349
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,087
Your sister's out of a job,
feeling cut up.

350
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:29,687
She's ain't out of a job no more!
She found something?

351
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:32,967
She's back here, isn't she?
She's back at Selfridges.

352
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:35,967
I want to put a whole family
in it.

353
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:38,087
Father, mother, children.

354
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:42,807
And the motor will be at an angle,
so it is almost flying.

355
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:45,727
You know for the children,
it has to be like a fairy tale.

356
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:49,647
They are going to the park, straw
hats, which they wave in the air.

357
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:51,567
Scarves, flowing out behind them.

358
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,327
A sailor suit for the boy.

359
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,447
A little white pinafore
for the girl.

360
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:59,287
It's going to be beautiful!

361
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:02,007
I'm glad you're back.

362
00:26:03,887 --> 00:26:05,807
This could be an exciting time
for you.

363
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:08,007
Mr Selfridge has brought you
back personally.

364
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:11,847
Mr Selfridge is THE best man
in the world!

365
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:13,567
He is?

366
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:16,127
He hasn't just given me my job back.

367
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,887
He's, erm... He's persuaded my dad
to leave town.

368
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:22,687
I can't tell you
how good that feels.

369
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:28,367
You know, the world is opening up
to you.

370
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:32,727
There is so much to learn,
if you reach out and take it.

371
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,887
So, Miss Love's day is over.

372
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:08,847
The question is -
who will take her place?

373
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:12,767
He overrides
every decision I make.

374
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:15,007
I'm his Chief of Staff!
In an emergency,

375
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:17,807
I would take over running the store.
But he doesn't value me.

376
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:19,727
Roger, I'm sure
that's just not true.

377
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,687
Perhaps it is I
who should tender my resignation.

378
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,567
No, you mustn't!

379
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:29,407
You're the only one
who really understands me.

380
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,167
Miss Mardle.

381
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:34,167
Lady Loxley.

382
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,967
How can I help you today?

383
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:40,767
I'd like to see your collection
of foot muffs, for motoring.

384
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:42,487
Very good!
Thank you!

385
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,407
Staff meeting, 6 o'clock, downstairs.

386
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:47,687
Mr Selfridge.
Lady Mae, what a pleasure!

387
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:50,527
Tony Travers.

388
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:52,727
How's the family?
How's the charming Rosalie?

389
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:55,887
Oh, she's well, thank you.
Good. And dear Mrs Selfridge?

390
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:57,607
Oh, she's well too.

391
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:00,247
I didn't know you wife was
the artistic sort, Selfridge.

392
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:02,447
I saw her at the Chelsea Arts Club
the other day.

393
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:05,167
She was having a pretty good time
with Roddy Temple.

394
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:08,607
He's been painting
a portrait of Rose.

395
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,527
Oh, how wonderful.

396
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,687
I didn't get a chance to thank you -

397
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:14,607
He's a Bohemian sort of chap,

398
00:28:14,647 --> 00:28:17,447
and The Arts Club
is a pretty racy place.

399
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,687
I wasn't expecting to see
Mrs Selfridge there.

400
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:22,567
Tony, you are so behind the times.

401
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:26,007
Since the Duchess of Rutland
started to frequent it,

402
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,687
everyone who's anyone
wants to be seen there.

403
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:31,327
How clever of Mrs Selfridge
to gain entrance.

404
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:33,047
And now, if you'll excuse me.

405
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:40,727
That was childish.

406
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,607
Well, I enjoyed myself.

407
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:46,207
If you're going to do something
like that, tell me first.

408
00:28:48,247 --> 00:28:50,447
Aren't I even allowed
to think for myself?

409
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:52,287
No! That's not the point of you
at all.

410
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:55,567
In fact I'm no longer sure
what the point is.

411
00:28:57,887 --> 00:28:59,607
Well then, if you'll excuse me.

412
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,887
You're a man of many talents.

413
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:19,967
You can't want to work here forever.
Do you have ambitions?

414
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,327
I want to open my own restaurant
in Soho.

415
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:26,207
I have friends and some influence.

416
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:29,007
I also have a chef
with whooping cough.

417
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:30,807
Come and cook for me this evening.

418
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:33,367
We could perhaps discuss this matter
further?

419
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:46,647
What an interesting painting
of Mrs Selfridge.

420
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:20,847
Miss Blenkinsop!

421
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:23,367
I'd like 40 white roses
sent round to my wife.

422
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:25,247
No, make it 50.

423
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:35,287
I thought we decided yesterday,

424
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:37,447
it was a good thing
you don't work here - for us.

425
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:39,767
Mr Selfridge came over himself.

426
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:43,767
He asked me back,
gave me a ride in his motor!

427
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:46,887
Victor, I've never felt so proud!

428
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:51,687
I suppose we can court anyway,
on the quiet.

429
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,927
Come on, get your coat.
Let's get out of here.

430
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:59,007
Oh, Mr Selfridge is giving a talk.

431
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:00,807
He won't miss us.

432
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:02,807
I have to stay.

433
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:07,327
After, then.
How about I take you out for a meal?

434
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:10,287
My uncle's got this place in
Clerkenwell. I can't, not tonight.

435
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,687
I said to Mr Leclair that I'd
help with the window for tomorrow.

436
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:17,887
That man snaps his fingers,
you come running.

437
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,807
I want to be with you.

438
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:24,847
I want that too.
But I promised Mr Leclair.

439
00:31:24,887 --> 00:31:29,647
If I let him down, it'd be as if
I was letting Mr Selfridge down.

440
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,367
What about letting me down?

441
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:33,327
You'll say anything to get your way.

442
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:37,767
You know, I'm fed up
of being told what to do.

443
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,607
I'm not telling you what to do.

444
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:45,927
You have to wear white
to be presented, Lady Mae says.

445
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:48,007
All the young girls do.

446
00:31:49,047 --> 00:31:51,247
This one's pretty, don't you think?

447
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:53,487
I'm not sure about the train.

448
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:55,207
You must have a train!

449
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,127
And I have to get used to them.
When I eventually get presented,

450
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:01,807
the train has to be no less
than three yards in length
from the shoulders.

451
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:03,767
It sounds rather ornate.

452
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:05,487
It's tradition.

453
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:09,007
For you, Mrs Selfridge.

454
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:11,847
Oh!

455
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:19,327
White roses, they are so beautiful!

456
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,087
From Harry?

457
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:29,167
Thank you, Fraser. Will you put them
in water? I'll arrange them later.

458
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:30,967
How lovely they are!

459
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:34,887
I hope I find a husband like Pa.

460
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:56,798
I wanted to talk to you
about something

461
00:32:56,868 --> 00:32:59,028
that's very important to me.

462
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:01,068
Honesty.

463
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:03,628
We believe in upright behaviour
in this store.

464
00:33:03,668 --> 00:33:05,948
Every customer can trust

465
00:33:05,988 --> 00:33:08,308
they are getting exactly
what they're paying for.

466
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:10,508
They make a lovely couple,
don't they?

467
00:33:10,548 --> 00:33:12,468
I am proud of that!

468
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:14,228
I hope you are proud too.

469
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:17,868
But even here, standards can slip.

470
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:21,908
You steal from this store,
you steal from yourselves.

471
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:26,228
Now, you all probably know
I started off as an errand boy.

472
00:33:26,268 --> 00:33:29,108
I was ten years old,
I earned a dollar fifty a week.

473
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:32,948
The day they promoted me to
stock boy, I damn near cried.

474
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:35,028
And then when they gave me the key

475
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:37,628
to open up the store
in the morning...

476
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:41,268
that's the day that I...
I won't forget.

477
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:43,828
The manager trusted me.

478
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:47,628
Without trust,
you can't run anything.

479
00:33:49,788 --> 00:33:52,068
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

480
00:33:52,108 --> 00:33:55,268
I won't tolerate dishonesty.

481
00:33:57,028 --> 00:34:00,148
But I'm here for you,
if you need my help.

482
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:06,868
Recently, a member of our staff
thought she had to leave her position

483
00:34:06,908 --> 00:34:09,428
because a member of her family
behaved foolishly.

484
00:34:09,468 --> 00:34:15,028
Now, it wasn't her fault, so
I refused to accept her resignation.

485
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:19,068
I would have done the same for
any of you in the same situation.

486
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:24,908
If you are in trouble,
come to me, don't steal from me.

487
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,348
Honest endeavour, together.

488
00:34:28,388 --> 00:34:32,548
This is the Spirit of Selfridge's.

489
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:06,308
Your ladyship,
Mr Colleano to see you.

490
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:08,308
I'd given up on you.

491
00:35:08,348 --> 00:35:12,108
Shame. I've got some
spatch-cock quail in here.

492
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:17,068
You've brought spatch-cock quail
into my sitting room?!

493
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:19,228
Thought I'd serve it up
with a salsa verde.

494
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:21,068
But if you don't want it...

495
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:23,908
Well, you're here now.

496
00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:26,068
Show Mr Colleano the kitchen.

497
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,748
Brooooom!

498
00:35:32,788 --> 00:35:34,468
Hey, Pa!

499
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:38,268
Is the motor in the window yet?
Going in tomorrow.

500
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:40,068
Can I come see it?
You sure can.

501
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:41,788
See ya!
Alright!

502
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:48,628
Humphrey was now after something
else. He had made several traps -

503
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:53,628
Did you like the flowers?
I loved them.

504
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:56,108
I meant every word of the message.

505
00:35:57,508 --> 00:36:00,308
You're blushing.
I am not!

506
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:03,348
Not like you did when
the painter man kissed you.

507
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:05,628
Then you went really red.

508
00:36:19,748 --> 00:36:22,028
You're a good cook.

509
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:24,268
Sit down.

510
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:26,308
Help yourself to a glass of wine.

511
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:39,228
So Mr Colleano...
Or may I call you...? Victor.

512
00:36:40,788 --> 00:36:46,108
Victor. Tell me all about yourself.
Start from the beginning.

513
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,788
It suits you.

514
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:13,268
You should wear more colour.

515
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,788
Mr Leclair!

516
00:37:15,828 --> 00:37:19,748
I'd like to give it to you
for all your hard work tonight.

517
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:21,548
I couldn't accept this!

518
00:37:21,588 --> 00:37:25,028
Take it. I'll pay for it tomorrow.

519
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:27,748
Goodnight.

520
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:29,788
Thank you.

521
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:34,748
Good night.

522
00:38:21,388 --> 00:38:23,108
Oh no, you don't!

523
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:26,188
We need to have this out.

524
00:38:26,228 --> 00:38:29,828
It's bad enough that you kiss him
in this house -

525
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:32,708
but you do it in front of Beatrice!

526
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:34,708
Her own mother.

527
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:36,988
And then, you lied to me.

528
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:39,468
You said that everything
was gonna be alright.

529
00:38:39,508 --> 00:38:43,308
But you're having an affair,
with some two-bit painter!

530
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:46,588
You even sent the portrait
to my office!

531
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,828
What's happened to you, Rose?

532
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:53,868
Ellen Love paid me a visit
this morning.

533
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:58,348
Ellen? What did she want?

534
00:38:59,788 --> 00:39:03,428
Why does it have to be one rule for
you and another for the rest of us?

535
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:05,148
Whatever she said, it's not true.

536
00:39:05,188 --> 00:39:08,788
So you're telling me you're
not having a relationship
with Miss Love?

537
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,908
It's over.

538
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:22,828
And what about you?
Have you been with him?

539
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,628
No.

540
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:31,108
But would you blame me if I had?
I'd just be following your example.

541
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:34,028
Don't say that.
All these years I have sat at home,

542
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:36,468
while you've gone out
and had your fun!

543
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:40,028
Do you think that
I want to be this way?

544
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:43,388
Do you think that it makes me happy?

545
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:45,748
Now I'm meant to feel sorry for you,
is that right?

546
00:39:45,788 --> 00:39:48,908
Well, maybe I will tomorrow.
But tonight - you can go to hell!

547
00:40:05,388 --> 00:40:07,548
Another one.

548
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:09,588
Drinking, old boy?
Yeah.

549
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:11,948
Not like you.
And losing too.

550
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:13,828
I've lost a packet.
What can I get you?

551
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:15,708
Whiskey.
Whiskey.

552
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,428
What happened?

553
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:23,068
Well... Ellen paid my wife a visit
today.

554
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:24,788
Uh-oh!

555
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:31,548
Rose thinks I'm no damn good.

556
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:34,668
She may be right.

557
00:40:39,868 --> 00:40:42,028
Normally I stay off this poison.

558
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:48,708
My father had a penchant for it.

559
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:51,188
Really?

560
00:40:51,228 --> 00:40:53,348
You mother paints the Major
as a bit of a saint.

561
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:58,108
Let's just say -
Ma likes to remember the good times.

562
00:41:00,268 --> 00:41:02,588
What are we drinking to?
Anything you like.

563
00:41:03,988 --> 00:41:05,668
To my father!

564
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,388
The Major.

565
00:41:07,428 --> 00:41:10,348
To Pa and everything
that he stood for!

566
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,748
Cheers.

567
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:19,748
More cards, that's what I need.

568
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:21,588
Shouldn't you call it a night?

569
00:41:24,228 --> 00:41:25,908
Mr Selfridge?
Yeah.

570
00:41:25,948 --> 00:41:30,268
Someone to see you.
I'm sorry, I couldn't stop her.

571
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:41,628
What are you doing here?

572
00:41:46,108 --> 00:41:49,668
I told your wife,
and I'll tell you -

573
00:41:50,668 --> 00:41:54,948
I won't be cast off
like a piece of nothing.

574
00:41:54,988 --> 00:41:58,348
You're doped up and you're not
thinking straight. Just go home.

575
00:41:59,188 --> 00:42:01,388
The flat's not the same without you.

576
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:07,828
Please, Harry. Come with me.

577
00:42:08,668 --> 00:42:10,348
One last time.

578
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:14,308
I'm sorry if I misled you,
I really am.

579
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:17,388
But you have to understand,
I have a family.

580
00:42:22,628 --> 00:42:24,908
You're just the same
as all the others!

581
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:29,988
You are a whore mongering,
low-life bastard!

582
00:42:30,028 --> 00:42:32,348
Time to go, old thing. Time to go.

583
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:35,348
Please don't do this to me, Harry.
I love you. Come on!

584
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:37,348
I love you.
Let's go.

585
00:42:57,428 --> 00:42:59,108
Thank you, son.

586
00:43:01,908 --> 00:43:04,788
Harry, old chap? I put her in a cab.

587
00:43:04,828 --> 00:43:07,188
I'll go and check on her later,
see she's all right.

588
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:09,988
Go home. Get some sleep.

589
00:43:35,748 --> 00:43:38,068
'I've got a secret
that I can't tell you!'

590
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,788
Ellen?

591
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:01,828
Ellen?

592
00:44:16,308 --> 00:44:17,988
Jesus!

593
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:30,948
Harry. You came.

594
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:39,068
Come on, let's get you up.

595
00:45:03,028 --> 00:45:05,028
'Your father's no war hero.'

596
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:11,708
'I can't seem to find my way
out of it.'

597
00:45:13,868 --> 00:45:16,348
'Dad, you're nothing
but a common huckster.'

598
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:20,868
'But I'm your blood and you're
mine whether you like it or not.'

599
00:45:20,908 --> 00:45:23,108
'Come with me... with me...'

600
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:25,828
Not like you did
when the painter man kissed you.

601
00:45:25,868 --> 00:45:28,108
'All these years
I have sat at home!'

602
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:30,908
'..low-life bastard!'

603
00:45:30,948 --> 00:45:33,508
'Have your fun!'

604
00:45:33,548 --> 00:45:35,908
'You're nothing
but a common huckster.'

605
00:45:39,228 --> 00:45:40,948
'Nothing but a common huckster.'

606
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,268
'Who are you?'
'Who are you?'

607
00:45:58,788 --> 00:46:00,628
As you all must have heard
by now,

608
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:03,388
the Chief had a serious
automobile accident.

609
00:46:04,748 --> 00:46:07,908
I am Chief Of Staff.
This ship needs a Captain.
I am that man.

610
00:46:07,988 --> 00:46:10,668
Taking it bad, isn't he,
your Mr Leclair?

611
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:12,428
He's not MY Mr Leclair.

612
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:15,148
The Suffragettes are walking past
the building tomorrow.

613
00:46:15,188 --> 00:46:17,268
Some of the stores
are very worried about it.

614
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:19,648
They are not to set foot within
these four walls. Is that clear?

615
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:21,997
We've got a real problem
on our hands tomorrow.

616
00:46:22,037 --> 00:46:25,517
Unless we do something about it,
the store could be in real trouble.

617
