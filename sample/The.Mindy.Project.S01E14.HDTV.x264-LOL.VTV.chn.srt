вжд╩
I would love to meet a cool guy, except all the guys I meet

164
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:01,162
вжд╩
are either 19-year-old murderers or 80-year-old judges.

165
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:02,747
вжд╩
You know what, I think I'm gonna find you someone.

166
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:04,199
вжд╩
No, I really wouldn't try. Yeah, great.

167
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,835
вжд╩
This girl is the pickiest dater I have ever met in my life.

168
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:08,536
вжд╩
No, no, I'm actually a very good matchmaker.

169
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:10,038
вжд╩
Well, I wish you luck,

170
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,257
вжд╩
but no one's ever good enough for this girl.

171
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,324
вжд╩
So I wouldn't even try.

172
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:16,010
вжд╩
So Mindy at the museum...

173
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:19,180
вжд╩
Ah, Danny.

174
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:21,099
вжд╩
Tear up that suicide note. I have great news.

175
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:22,967
вжд╩
Okay, that wasn't a suicide note.

176
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:24,602
вжд╩
I was contesting a jaywalking ticket.

177
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:25,937
вжд╩
Oh. I am sorry about that.

178
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:27,522
вжд╩
Danny, I am going to set you up on a date.

179
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:29,891
вжд╩
This morning you said I should throw myself back into work.

180
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:31,142
вжд╩
That was, like, six hours ago, okay?

181
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:32,343
вжд╩
That's an entire lifetime for some bugs.

182
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:33,444
вжд╩
You're gonna love this girl.

183
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,396
вжд╩
She is pretty. She is smart.

184
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:37,448
вжд╩
She owns a motor scooter. Ah.

185
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:39,951
вжд╩
It's Lucy. Lucy of Jamie and Lucy?

186
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,619
вжд╩
They broke up? I am dating Jamie

187
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,787
вжд╩
of Jamie and Mindy.

188
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:43,788
вжд╩
We kissed mouths, Danny.

189
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:44,856
вжд╩
Okay, I don't know.

190
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:46,124
вжд╩
I just... I don't know if I'm ready.

191
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:48,042
вжд╩
Well, you would also be doing me a huge favor.

192
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,627
вжд╩
If you spend time with Lucy,

193
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:51,296
вжд╩
then Jamie won't spend as much time with her.

194
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:52,463
вжд╩
Also, this is a big deal.

195
00:05:52,464 --> 00:05:53,548
вжд╩
I am setting you up with someone.

196
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:54,782
вжд╩
You never set me up with anybody.

197
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,267
вжд╩
That's not true. I hooked you up with Reynaldo.

198
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,119
вжд╩
Your garbage man? Yeah.

199
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:00,121
вжд╩
He was smokin' hot, but he was a little pretentious.

200
00:06:00,122 --> 00:06:02,440
вжд╩
A little bit too well read, if I may say that.

201
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,441
вжд╩
Danny, please do this for me.

202
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,576
вжд╩
Can I think about it? Danny!

203
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:05,660
вжд╩
You are so selfish!

204
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:06,944
вжд╩
I don't care if you're depressed!

205
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:07,945
вжд╩
Just help me out for once! Okay, stop...

206
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:09,080
вжд╩
All right. I am gonna die alone

207
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:10,465
вжд╩
unless you do this for me. Stop hitting me.

208
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:12,834
вжд╩
I'll go on one date with her, okay?

209
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:14,135
вжд╩
Are you serious? One.

210
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:15,620
вжд╩
Oh, my God, Danny, thank you. Thank you.

211
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,954
вжд╩
Okay. When everyone's mean about you,

212
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:18,473
вжд╩
I defend you most of the time.

213
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:19,807
вжд╩
Okay, I'm good on the hug, though.

214
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,142
вжд╩
Thanks. To show my gratitude

215
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:22,594
вжд╩
for this kindness,

216
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:25,963
вжд╩
we can choose any city of real housewives to watch.

217
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:28,013
вжд╩
Miami.

218
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:29,033
вжд╩
Yes.

219
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,348
вжд╩
Deborah, do you like working in the morgue?

220
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:37,717
вжд╩
Well, I don't get a lot of patient complaints.

221
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:40,553
вжд╩
It's funny that you work in the morgue

222
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:44,340
вжд╩
because my name is morg-an.

223
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:48,311
вжд╩
Please wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

224
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:49,312
вжд╩
Nope.

225
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:51,314
вжд╩
Nothing. Sorry.

226
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:53,199
вжд╩
Uh, Dr. Reed.

227
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,734
вжд╩
Did you see me hit on that girl?

228
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:55,868
вжд╩
Unfortunately, I did, yes.

229
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,853
вжд╩
I've had my eye on her for a while.

230
00:06:57,854 --> 00:06:58,988
вжд╩
I'm gonna take her to the batting cages,

231
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:00,289
вжд╩
if you know what I mean.

232
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,824
вжд╩
Well, let me know how that doesn't work out.

233
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,076
вжд╩
Okay, here's my plan. I am going

234
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:04,961
вжд╩
to put these in the ladies' room

235
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:06,529
вжд╩
in all the stalls.

236
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:08,414
вжд╩
"Me with out go"... No, no, read it up...

237
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:09,665
вжд╩
Oh. "Will you go out with me?"

238
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,634
вжд╩
And then she'll be like, "What?

239
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:12,868
вжд╩
Yes."

240
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:16,091
вжд╩
Morgan, what if somebody uses the bathroom before her?

241
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:17,223
вжд╩
Yep, not a good idea.

242
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:18,707
вжд╩
Plan "B."

243
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:20,393
вжд╩
Surprise her in her car tonight.

244
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:22,095
вжд╩
That's a felony. Not on Valentine's day.

245
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:22,985
вжд╩
Doesn't matter what the holiday is.

246
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:23,729
вжд╩
Check the laws in this country.

247
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:25,064
вжд╩
I'm not even sure about that.

248
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:28,384
вжд╩
Morgan, wait.

249
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:30,853
вжд╩
- Maybe I could help you. - Really?

250
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:32,772
вжд╩
Oh, God, that would be so good.

251
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:36,409
вжд╩
Coming, I'm coming.

252
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,410
вжд╩
- Hey. - Hey.

253
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:38,945
вжд╩
Why are you so early?

254
00:07:38,996 --> 00:07:40,580
вжд╩
- Ten minutes? - Yeah.

255
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,747
вжд╩
You're ten minutes early, Danny,

256
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:43,366
вжд╩
which is worse than two hours late.

257
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,534
вжд╩
Those last ten minutes,

258
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:47,253
вжд╩
that's when I go from "Whoa" To "Damn."

259
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:48,504
вжд╩
Wait a minute.

260
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:50,906
вжд╩
Why did I have to come here first, anyways?

261
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,408
вжд╩
Well, you are going on a date with my friend.

262
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:53,926
вжд╩
Mm-hmm. And I wanted to make sure

263
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:55,595
вжд╩
that you didn't look weird.

264
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:56,912
вжд╩
You had, like, a mustache or something.

265
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,415
вжд╩
How would I grow a mustache since this morning?

266
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:00,749
вжд╩
I don't know. I'm not Italian.

267
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,968
вжд╩
Also, it's good when I'm getting pretty

268
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:03,136
вжд╩
for there to be a guy here, so he can be like,

269
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:06,472
вжд╩
"Hurry up! We're gonna be late!" What?

270
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:07,513
вжд╩
Why are you looking at me?

271
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:09,108
вжд╩
Are you sure you want to wear that?

272
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:11,611
вжд╩
It being on me implies that I want to wear it.

273
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:14,597
вжд╩
Okay. I like it.

274
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,316
вжд╩
Wow.

275
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:19,768
вжд╩
A whole room that's a closet?

276
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,037
вжд╩
You could make this into a little gym,

277
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:22,271
вжд╩
hang a heavy bag there.

278
00:08:22,272 --> 00:08:23,906
вжд╩
Yeah, Danny, that's what I want.

279
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:26,108
вжд╩
I want a bag full of sand to punch

280
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:28,578
вжд╩
instead of all my clothes.

281
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:30,246
вжд╩
Okay, what about this one? You like that?

282
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,465
вжд╩
Let me guess: You want me to wear a little black dress,

283
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:34,300
вжд╩
push-up bra, high heels.

284
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:36,135
вжд╩
Boring, sexy, anonymous girl.

285
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,336
вжд╩
Sexy's not boring.

286
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:38,754
вжд╩
You got any food? Cold cuts?

287
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:41,140
вжд╩
No, but I think I have some pizza from election night.

288
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:44,810
вжд╩
I think this date's gonna be fun.

289

Let's take a shot. You look nice.

290

00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,233

True love. Sex with new people.

What?

299

That's a king salmon over there.

So?

301
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:06,515
вжд╩
Jillian studied the migration of that fish.

302
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:07,934
вжд╩
No. Yeah. That fish goes from salt water...

303
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:09,135
вжд╩
No. Stop it. To fresh water.

304
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:10,770
вжд╩
It's an amazing fish.

305
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:11,804

They do it to mate. Nobody cares.

306
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:12,805

To mate. Danny, nobody cares.

00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:13,890

Is everything okay?

вжд╩
Really good.

310
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:17,476
вжд╩
Would you mind switching seats with me?

311
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,445
вжд╩
Because that fish is in my eye line,

312
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:21,030
вжд╩
just putting me in a...

313
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,865
вжд╩
A bad place emotionally right now.

314
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,033
вжд╩
The fish?

315
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:25,868
вжд╩
That one, yeah. Yeah?

316
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,320
вжд╩
Yeah, sure. It's your eye line. Do you mind?

317
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:29,705
вжд╩
Okay, great. Thanks.

318
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,739
вжд╩
Wouldn't want to look

319

at something I didn't like.

320
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:33,876

Oh, yeah, thank you. That's much better.

321
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:35,494

Good.

So can I ask what exactly your problem is

324
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,451
вжд╩
Oh, it's just, my ex was an oceanographer.

325
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:43,502
вжд╩
It's stupid.

326
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:44,552
вжд╩
Yeah, it is stupid.

327
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:45,888
вжд╩
Hey, look at this bread selection.

328
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,890
вжд╩
There's white bread. There's the brown bread.

329
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:50,343
вжд╩
Just if I keep myself from seeing triggers,

330
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:51,727
вжд╩
then, you know,

331
00:09:51,762 --> 00:09:52,761
вжд╩
I don't fixate on her...

332
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:53,896
вжд╩
Ow!

333
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:55,398
вжд╩
Did somebody just kick me?

334
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:56,565
вжд╩
You okay? Ow!

335
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:57,650
вжд╩
Yeah, that is so weird.

336
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,402
вжд╩
I think that maybe we should move tables,

337
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:01,520
вжд╩
or we could try not talking about exes

338
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:03,639
вжд╩
and see if the kicking stops. You know what, though?

339
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,908
вжд╩
I have found that the hardest breakups

340
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,243
вжд╩
are the ones where you might have

341
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:09,078
вжд╩
underestimated the person while you were with them,

342
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:10,312
вжд╩
I don't know if...

343
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:12,081
вжд╩
Yes. That's exactly what I'm going through.

344
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:14,149
вжд╩
- Really? - Yes.

345
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,317
вжд╩
It... it's like you're...

346
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:16,535
вжд╩
I know, it's so weird.

347
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:17,987
вжд╩
That's exactly what is going on

348
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:19,538
вжд╩
with me and Jillian. No way.

349
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,123
вжд╩
Well, it was me, really. I just...

350
00:10:21,124 --> 00:10:22,258
вжд╩
Tell me about that.

351
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,659
вжд╩
- Uh, Jamie? - Yeah.

352
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,794
вжд╩
I don't want to jinx this,

353
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:26,379
вжд╩
but I think match-dot-Mindy

354
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,546
вжд╩
might have another success story.

355
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:29,765
вжд╩
You know, you can have a friendship, maybe.

356
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,684
вжд╩
Yeah?

357
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:32,868
вжд╩
So, Morgan, you want to take

358
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:34,203
вжд╩
this girl to the batting cages.

359
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:35,388
вжд╩
I'm still not sure what those are.

360
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:36,939
вжд╩
Three-pronged attack, Morgan.

361
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,641
вжд╩
Number one, casual approach.

362
00:10:38,642 --> 00:10:39,892
вжд╩
Watch me, watch me, watch me.

363
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:41,277
вжд╩
What am I doing? What am I doing?

364
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:42,311
вжд╩
What am I doing? I don't know what you're gonna...

365
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:43,646
вжд╩
Now.

366
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:45,064
вжд╩
Wow, okay, you look like Joe Biden.

367
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:46,232
вжд╩
That is awesome.

368
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:49,652
вжд╩
Number two, initiate some light physical contact.

369
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:50,653
вжд╩
- Okay. - Oh, red.

370
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:51,954
вжд╩
Nice color. Oh, yeah.

371
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,456
вжд╩
It's Valentine's day, and it hides the blood.

372
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,742
вжд╩
That's disgusting. Number three. Offer her something small.

373
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,828
вжд╩
A token of sorts. It establishes a debt.

374
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:01,247
вжд╩
Got a free cola from the vending machine.

375
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:03,416
вжд╩
Oh, I've actually been staring at that thing all morning.

376
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:05,751
вжд╩
Thanks, doc. I owe you one.

377
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,753
вжд╩
Oh! It's a... Part of the routine.

378
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:08,921
вжд╩
- There it is. - Okay.

379
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:09,972
вжд╩
It's the debt. I got it.

380
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:11,687
вжд╩
You just give her whatever you have on you.

381
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,009
вжд╩
Why not? All right.

382
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,063
вжд╩
So I'll be like, "Hey, this is for you."

383
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:19,932
вжд╩
Where's the body?

384
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,383
вжд╩
I just found the head in the toilet.

385
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:22,768
вжд╩
Oh, God.

386
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:24,720
вжд╩
You never know a love song

387
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:25,938
вжд╩
until you have a broken heart, right?

388
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,239
вжд╩
Mm, yes.

389
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,025
вжд╩
And finally you realize that all of these songs

390
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,409
вжд╩
that you thought were so happy-sounding

391
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,744
вжд╩
are actually so sad.

392
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:33,279
вжд╩
Like you can call me Al. Mm.

393
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,448
вжд╩
"Where is my wife and family?

394
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:36,782
вжд╩
What if I die here?"

395
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,584
вжд╩
Who'll be my role model now that my... once my...

396
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:40,119
вжд╩
Role model's gone?

397
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,504
вжд╩
Man, I gotta download that album again. Mm-hmm.

398
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:42,505
вжд╩
It's a great one.

399
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:44,073
вжд╩
I think they really like each other.

400
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:45,374
вжд╩
Well, they like Paul Simon.

401
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,575
вжд╩
So does everyone else on the planet.

402
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:48,019
вжд╩
No, it's like we're not even here.

403
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,128
вжд╩
Hey, guys.

404
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,429
вжд╩
Hey, there's four of us here.

405
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,514
вжд╩
So let's try to... Oh.

406
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:53,265
вжд╩
Sorry. Oh, it's okay.

407
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,518
вжд╩
Danny was just helping me

408
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,520
вжд╩
figure out where I should get my first tattoo.

409
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:58,604
вжд╩
Uh-oh.

410
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:00,856
вжд╩
Um, you hate tattoos.

411
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:02,074
вжд╩
I don't think so.

412
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:03,992
вжд╩
I think I'm gonna get a tattoo as we.

413
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:05,661
вжд╩
A little butterfly on the nape of my neck,

414
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:07,263
вжд╩
and it would signify that I'm a free spirit...

415
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:08,531
вжд╩
What tattoo are you gonna get?

416
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:11,684
вжд╩
Well, I think I should keep it a secret,

417
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:12,768
вжд╩
because where I want to get it,

418
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,169
вжд╩
only certain people would see it.

419
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:16,605
вжд╩
I-I don't know, Luce.

420
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:18,808
вжд╩
I worry that a tattoo is a little short-sighted.

421
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:20,526
вжд╩
You know? Mmm. Can I try that?

422
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,894
вжд╩
Is your grandson really gonna understand

423
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:23,562
вжд╩
why you have a radiohead lyric

424
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:25,064
вжд╩
under your belly button?

425
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,148
вжд╩
I can't understand radiohead now.

426
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:27,400
вжд╩
Mmm!

427
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:29,618
вжд╩
Do you wanna have some of my COD?

428
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:31,370
вжд╩
I'm fine. I just had some.

429
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:34,206

Wow, that lamb is so, mmm, succulent.

430
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,658
вжд╩
It is succulent.

431
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:37,326
вжд╩
You are such a good orderer. Thank you.

432
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,027

Pick a good restaurant, and they say, you know,

433
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:40,162
вжд╩
the food orders itself, so...

434
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,548
вжд╩
Mmm, try this. Okay.

435
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:44,032

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Lucy!

436

вжд╩
- Your cold. - Hmm?

437
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:46,702

She had this horrible cold last week.

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,753
вжд╩
I'm good with it. I'll take it.

439
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:49,004
вжд╩
You might get something.

440
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:50,423
вжд╩
I'm not sick. Do you want some of my COD?

441
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:51,807
вжд╩
I don't get sick that often. I don't have a cold.

442

вжд╩
- You don't? - No.

443
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,042
вжд╩
Eat off my fork. It's romantic.

444
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:55,644

I don't need it. I'm not hungry.

445

Eat off my fork, please.

446
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,898

Isn't that good?

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,067
вжд╩
You all right, buddy?

448
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:03,736
вжд╩
It was just a little piece of COD.

449
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,053

I'm so sorry. It's got bones in it. That's why.

Hey, Jamie? Are you good?

They're doctors. You should just...

Okay?

You sure?

I'm gonna... It has bones in it.

I can Heimlich. I know. Please let me Heimlich you.

457

Okay.

458
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,583

I'm not gonna let you die in this weird restaurant, Jamie.

459
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,201

Should we get dessert?

460
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:21,036
вжд╩
I think he's choking.

No, he's okay.

She's a doctor. She's got it.

468
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,509

I just don't understand why, in 2013,

469

вжд╩
restaurants have any bones in their fish.

470
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,529

And while I appreciate the gift certificate

вжд╩
as a gesture,

472
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,282
вжд╩
I did think the manager was passive-aggressive,

473
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,349
вжд╩
the way that he gave it.

Jamie, I cannot believe you took me

вжд╩
to the empire state building for Valentine's day.

488
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:15,377
вжд╩
Last year, the guy I was with,

489
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:16,679
вжд╩
he took me to an Indian casino,

490
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,147
вжд╩
and I lost $2,000.

491
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,548
вжд╩
Well, this is actually

492
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:20,733
вжд╩
something I've always wanted to do.

493
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:23,403

And I figured I'd come with the perfect person

494

Wait, wait. Jamie.

on the entire planet... Yeah.

Just... you're not in love with Lucy, are you?

501

Next, please.

502
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:39,836
вжд╩
Why do you keep saying things like that?

503
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,671
вжд╩
It just seems like you were really jealous

504
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,712
вжд╩
of her and Danny at dinner.

505
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,340

Okay, I'm not jealous of a guy

507
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:46,692

See? That sounds jealous.

508
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:48,111

Lucy is my best friend.

509
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:49,345
вжд╩
Next. And if I love her,

510
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,707
вжд╩
it's the way I would love a sister.

511
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:53,232
вжд╩
I have a brother, and if rishi looked at me that way,

512
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,400

I would have to talk to our dad.

513
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:56,119

00:14:56,153 --> 00:14:57,520

All right? Can you just give me a break here?

517
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:01,357
вжд╩
Just look into your lover's eyes.

518
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,909
вжд╩
It's Valentine's day, for God's sake. Come on.

519
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,210
вжд╩
Quick scenario, okay?

520
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:06,712
вжд╩
You are on death row because you murdered a cop.

521
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:08,464
вжд╩
What? This is hypothetical.

522
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:09,999
вжд╩
You can only see one more person before they electrocute you.

523
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
вжд╩
Who would it be?

524
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,135
вжд╩
My lawyer

525
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:13,336
вжд╩
because I wouldn't do something like that.

526
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,554
вжд╩
Okay, your lawyer bungled the case,

527
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:16,923
вжд╩
and you have one person to see before you die.

528
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:19,759
вжд╩
You can say me if it's me.

529
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:28,484
вжд╩
It's Lucy.

530
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:29,652
вжд╩
I knew it.

531
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:30,903
вжд╩
You're good at this.

532
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:32,271
вжд╩
It's Lucy!

533
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:34,106

I'm in love with Lucy!

534
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,326

No, no, no, it's okay. Don't...

535
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:38,411
вжд╩
I'm not Lucy.

536
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,863
вжд╩
No, I mean, it's not...

537
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:41,863
вжд╩
It's not, like, traumatizing.

538
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:43,166
вжд╩
It's okay. It's not...

539
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,200
вжд╩
It's just... I'm okay with it.

540
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:47,286

Okay, folks. Next.

541
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:48,621

Jamie!

Okay, all right.

00:15:57,514 --> 00:15:59,015
вжд╩
That's it, Morgan.

548
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:01,601
вжд╩
Casual approach.

549
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:02,685
вжд╩
Okay, good.

550
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,103
вжд╩
Now some light contact.

551
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,355
вжд╩
Light.

552
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:07,523
вжд╩
What are you doing?

553
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:09,308
вжд╩
Morgan, human touching, not dog touching.

554
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,227
вжд╩
Agh.

555
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:14,197
вжд╩
Good... good... Good recovery, I guess.

556
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:15,648
вжд╩
Now parting gift, parting gift.

557
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:17,450
вжд╩
Come on, Morgan. Come on.

558
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:19,952

Oh, he found the body.

She's into it. Who knew? Okay.

Bravo, Morgan! Bravo.

Hey, man, I'm working here. Sorry.

You finally came for me, love!

564

Okay, shh. You finally called my name!

565

вжд╩
Shh. Come on, come on.

566
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,635
вжд╩
You're gonna wake up my neighbors.

567
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,670
вжд╩
I can't believe this is all because of you.

568
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:38,888
вжд╩
You showed me that love

569
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,423

of my face.

All right, that's so great.

I never thought I would feel this way, Mindy.

573
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,678
вжд╩
We can just walk. It is great.

574
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,812
вжд╩
And not dance and stuff.

575
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,382
вжд╩
I've never done anything like this.

576
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:49,482
вжд╩
Okay.

577
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:50,633
вжд╩
The whole time. Disgusting, water on my...

578
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,817
вжд╩
It's all because of you.

579
00:16:51,818 --> 00:16:53,486
вжд╩
You are such an important character

580
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,803
вжд╩
in the story of Lucy and me.

581
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:56,439
вжд╩
Don't you realize that?

582
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,740
вжд╩
Yeah. You're fate's helper.

583
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:59,275
вжд╩
I'm like the Joan Cusack character

584
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:01,577
вжд╩
in the romantic comedy of your life, yeah.

585
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:03,246
вжд╩
Yes! I can't believe it.

586
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:04,480
вжд╩
Can you believe this is me?

587
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,748
вжд╩
People are gonna think you're on drugs.

588
00:17:05,749 --> 00:17:06,916

I'm in love! Stop it, Jamie.

589
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,418

Hey! What the hell, you guys?

00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:21,640

Hey, what's going on, love birds?

593
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,009
вжд╩
Actually, we kind of broke up.

594
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,210
вжд╩
And, for the record, there is no kissing on my stoop.

595
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,013
вжд╩
That is a direct quote from my super.

596
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,681
вжд╩
Okay, well, I left my gloves at your place.

597
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:29,932
вжд╩
So I just came here to pick them up.

598
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,934
вжд╩
Did you think you would find them inside of her mouth?

599
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:34,153
вжд╩
You're making out with this guy?

600
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,155
вжд╩
This guy, they ask if he wanted a cocktail,

601
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,239
вжд╩
and he ordered shrimp?

602
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:39,942
вжд╩
Why are you yelling? Because I love you!

603
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:45,281
вжд╩
Really?

604
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,036
вжд╩
Okay, wait a minute.

605
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,403

I love you too!

606
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,289

Whoa, whoa, guys, we were just kissing a second ago.

607
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,591
вжд╩
All right, I'm gonna call it a night and head in.

608
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,959

Pardon me. God, I've been dreaming about this

609
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,427

for 15 years!

610
00:17:58,428 --> 00:18:00,079
вжд╩
Okay, can I... what made you change your mind?

611
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,246
вжд╩
Can I squeeze by here? My life flashed before my eyes

612
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,548
вжд╩
when I was choking.

613
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,083
вжд╩
Just... it suddenly dawned on me. Excuse me.

614
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:05,601
вжд╩
Not to be a stickler,

615
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:06,802
вжд╩
but I-I was the person

616
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:08,253
вжд╩
who helped make it dawn on you.

617
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:09,522

Mindy helped. She was like a supporting character.

00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:10,723
вжд╩
Oh, thank you!

619
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,141
вжд╩
Let's take a walk. Let's just get outta here.

620
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:13,926

That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

621
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,778

You know, I feel like if I had just worn the first dress,

622

вжд╩
that this wouldn't have been the situation.

623
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:20,432
вжд╩
I don't think that's the problem.

624
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,368
вжд╩
Hey, Dr. Reed. Morgan.

625
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,703

I'm gonna go pick up three or four calzones

626
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,372
вжд╩
and crawl into bed.

00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,940

Who am I kidding? It's gonna be four.

628
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,291
вжд╩
What happened? Did you strike out?

629
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,210
вжд╩
Ha. My first sports analogy.

630
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,378

I had her right where I wanted her.

00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,629
вжд╩
And then, bam!

632
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,831
вжд╩
She dumps me literally the second

00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:36,949
вжд╩
we're finished having sex.

634
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,450

Whoa, whoa, wait.

635
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,718
вжд╩
What... sex?

636
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,920
вжд╩
I did everything you told me.

637
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:41,954
вжд╩
I was playing it cool.

638
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,556
вжд╩
She pulls me into a supply closet.

639
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:46,092
вжд╩
We start having sex in front of a bunch of mops.

640
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:47,593
вжд╩
You got exactly what you wanted.

641
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,762
вжд╩
I wanted to take her to the batting cages.

642
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,230
вжд╩
I mean, you got the good stuff without the boring stuff.

643
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,464
вжд╩
Home run.

644
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,566
вжд╩
Did it again.

645
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,467
вжд╩
The batting cages is the good stuff.

646
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:57,770

I don't want to have sex with someone I care about

647

648
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,305
вжд╩
I want to do it the right way.

649
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,657
вжд╩
On the couch, in the living room,

650
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:02,741
вжд╩
after grandmother's asleep.

651
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,743
вжд╩
Morgan, I'm so sorry.

652
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:05,911
вжд╩
I need to make this up to you.

653
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,313
вжд╩
I feel like I've led you astray.

654
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,481
вжд╩
A stray?

655
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,117
вжд╩
Where is he?

656
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:12,317
вжд╩
We're gonna find him.

657
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,155
вжд╩
How'd he get in the building?

658
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,289
вжд╩
Another one, another one.

659
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,674
вжд╩
You gotta choke up. Don't get tired.

660
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:20,993
вжд╩
You can't quit. We don't quit in America.

661
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:22,261
вжд╩
Whoa.

662
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,379
вжд╩
Check on that, Morgan.

663
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,798
вжд╩
Show me how you did that weird swing.

664
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,933
вжд╩
I want to try that. That's pretty bad-ass.

665
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,785
вжд╩
You got, like, a Michael Caine, Gary Sheffield...

666
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:31,003
вжд╩
Oh! Oh, God!

667
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,154
вжд╩
Right in the car keys.

668
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:34,590

Oh! Oh, ho, ho!

669
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,842

Danny, I was this close

671
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,280
вжд╩
to spending Valentine's day at the empire state building.

672
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,815
вжд╩
To put that in you terms,

673
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,033
вжд╩
that's like losing your virginity

674
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:45,117
вжд╩
at Yankee stadium.

675
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,518
вжд╩
See, that's your problem.

676
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,953
вжд╩
Yeah, no, that's what I'm doing, Danny.

677
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,455
вжд╩
I'm describing my problem.

678
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,540
вжд╩
Who told you the empire state building was romantic?

679
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,459
вжд╩
A postcard at the airport gift shop?

680
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,194
вжд╩
Some dumb movie with tom Hanks

681
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,246
вжд╩
where he's hugging in the rain and there's no umbrellas?

682
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:59,331
вжд╩
You know what? Come here.

683
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,365
вжд╩
I want to show you something.

684
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:04,870

вжд╩
Oh, cool.

Your favorite pizza place.

687

вжд╩
Yeah, Danny, this does cheer me up.

688
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,094
вжд╩
Okay, I'm ready to go. No, no, no.

689
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:13,929
вжд╩
I want to show you something. Sit down.

690
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,881
вжд╩
Sal, can we get two slices? You got it.

691
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:17,933
вжд╩
This, like, a setting from goodfellas or something?

692
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:20,219
вжд╩
No, this is where I met my wife.

693
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,353

00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,311
вжд╩
Yep.

699
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,514

Were you ever like...

700
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:32,565
вжд╩
"Eh, Christina,

701

I think I still really miss her.

вжд╩
Well, now you can...

706
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:45,611
вжд╩
What are you doing?

707
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:46,695
вжд╩
Why do you need to take a picture of everything?

708
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:48,864
вжд╩
So that you always remember it and you never forget.

709
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,649
вжд╩
Stop it. I want to show Morgan.

710

No, don't...

We can tell him about it, okay?

you don't know it's gonna be romantic ahead of time.

714

вжд╩
Like, for you, it could be anywhere.

715
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,759
вжд╩
Like a barbershop

716
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:03,128
вжд╩
or an ATM shelter

717
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,380
вжд╩
or h&r block.

718
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:06,599
вжд╩
Danny, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be

719
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,850
вжд╩
the empire state building,

720
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,268
вжд╩
but those are very cute suggestions.

721
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,136
вжд╩
By the way, eye patch was wrong about you.

722
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,855
вжд╩
You're not mean.

723
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,473
вжд╩
She just didn't know you well enough.

724
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,691

There you go, Danny.

725
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:18,394

You're so weird.

734
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,377
вжд╩
Go to bed.
