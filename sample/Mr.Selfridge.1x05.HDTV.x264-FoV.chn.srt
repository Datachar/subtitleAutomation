{\a6}前情提要

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
你怎么能偷自己主家的东西
You don't steal from your work family!

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,240
我非常抱歉 塞尔福里奇先生
I'm so sorry, Mr Selfridge.

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,440
我没看到边上有塞尔福里奇百货的标志
I don't see the Selfridge's livery on the side.

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,812
一直都是你给它装货吗  
It's always you that loads it? 

6
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:09,240
我都是听阿尔夫和萨姆的吩咐
I do what Alfie and Sam tell me.

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,480
你只是个售货员
You're a shop girl.

8
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,234
你的工作也丢了吧 
Lost your job, have you? 

9
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:17,040
你已经毁了一切 这下你还想要什么
You've done your damage. What more do you want?

10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,720
我是塞尔福里奇夫人
I am Mrs.Selfridge.

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,560
你明知道我爱上了你
You knew I was falling in love with you.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,560
是要报复爱伦・乐芙那件事吗 是吗
Was it revenge for Ellen Love, was that it?

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,480
你跟塞尔福里奇百货的合同终止了
Your contract with Selfridge's is over.

14
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,200
我怎么没见到你太太
I don't see your wife anywhere!

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,880
我太太不需要你关心 再见 爱伦
My wife is not your concern. Goodbye, Ellen.

塞尔福里奇先生
第一季第五集

23
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:03,282
这项目看来花费不菲啊 塞尔福里奇先生
This seems a rather expensive enterprise, Mr Selfridge.

24
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:04,743
它会带来更多的利润 
It will more than pay for itself. 

25
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:06,402
那要怎么把它弄进橱窗里?
How will we get it in the window?

26
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,642
这你不用担心 恩里是老手了
Don't worry about that. Henri's an old hand.

27
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:10,842
我们会先拆开它 然后再拼起来
We'll dismantle it and then put it together.

28
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:11,523
天啊 
My God! 

29
00:01:11,524 --> 00:01:14,862
我们以前就在马歇尔・费兹百货轻而易举地做到
It worked like a dream for us at Marshall Field.

30
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:16,671
而在那时
But back then,

31
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:21,071
整个芝加哥只有一千五百人有驾照
there were only 1,500 registered drivers in the whole of Chicago.

32
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:24,103
而如今的伦敦 则超过三万六千人有驾照 
In London today, there are over 36,000. 

33
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:26,151
他们将会经过 他们将会看到
They'll come, they'll see,

34
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:28,991
他们将会走进来 他们将会买下这个车
they'll walk inside and they'll buy the products.

35
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,871
她很美对吧
Isn't she a beauty?

36
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:34,551
保险公司可不办理开这个车的保险啊
This automobile is not insured for anyone to drive.

37
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:36,791
即使是你 塞尔福里奇先生
Not even you, Mr Selfridge.

38
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:41,191
你怎么想
What do you think?

39
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,871
- 太棒了! - 橱窗要怎么摆
- Magnificent! - How is the window shaping up?

40
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:46,871
"驶向新时代"
"Motoring for the Modern Age!"

41
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:49,511
嗯 我真想念艾格尼思・陶勒小姐的敏锐眼光
Well, I miss Agnes Towler's keen eye.

42
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:51,351
那就让她和你一起工作
So get her to work with you.

43
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,071
我不能 她走了
I can't. She's gone.

44
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,751
走了?
Gone?

45
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,911
什么 你不知道吗
What? Didn't you know?

46
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:02,031
他父亲闹事之后 她就离职了
After that business with her father, she has left.

47
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:08,111
算了 至少乔治还有工作
Well, at least George is still in work.

48
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,071
要是没了他那份薪水 我真不知道会怎样
Without his wages, I don't know where we'd be.

49
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:14,421
你会关照他的 对吧
You'll look out for him, won't you? 

50
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:15,471
当然会
Course I will.

51
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:19,551
我爸又回来了
My dad's come back.

52
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:21,271
我还以为你已经换锁了
I thought you'd changed the locks?

53
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:26,511
他昨晚喝多了 在楼道里晕过去了
He turned up last night, drunk, passed out on the stairs.

54
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:29,311
房东夫人说如果不解决好他的事
My landlady told me if I didn't get him out of the way,

55
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:30,551
那我们都得离开 
that we'd all be out. 

56
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:31,871
我们一定要想个办法
We'll have to work out something.

57
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:34,911
他不能永远呆在这里 我一直在想
He can't stay here forever. I've been thinking...

58
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:36,991
或许你丢了工作也不是件坏事
maybe it's not so bad you left your job.

59
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,440
为什么 
What? 

60
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:40,431
对你我来说
Well, for you and me.

61
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:42,431
我们现在可以约会了
We can go out together now.

62
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:45,151
我们这周末一起去布莱顿吧
How about we go down to Brighton this weekend?

63
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:48,151
布莱顿?我们去那里做什么?
Brighton? What would we do there?

64
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:53,191
月光下牵着手 在码头沙滩上漫步
Walk on the beach, go down the pier, hold hands in the moonlight.

65
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:56,711
我知道你想让我高兴起来 但我真的没心情
I know you're trying to cheer me up, but I'm not in the mood.

66
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:59,471
我是在追求你
I'm asking if I can court you.

67
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:01,631
这才是我要做的事情
That's what I'm doing

68
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,471
哦 我懂了
Oh, I see.

69
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,511
你从来没想过吗
Hadn't it crossed your mind at all?

70
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,391
没怎么想过
Not really.

71
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:12,711
好吧 也许想过一点...
Well, maybe a bit...

72
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:15,871
一点?好吧 我想是个好开始
A bit? Well, I suppose that's a start.

73
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,791
我喜欢你 维克托 你知道的
I like you, Victor, you know I do.

74
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:23,511
但我麻烦事太多 不值得你这样
But I'm more trouble than I'm worth.

75
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:27,911
考虑到乔治和我爸 还有我失去工作的事
What with George and my dad, and me without a job.

76
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:31,831
你不会愿意追求我的
You don't want to court me.

77
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,951
我愿意 胜过一切
I do. More than anything.

78
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,071
那你就是我女朋友了?
Are you my girl then?

79
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:51,391
我想我只好是了
I think I must be.

80
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:17,511
陶勒小姐在吗 一向是陶勒小姐招呼我的
Miss Towler available? I always deal with Miss Towler!

81
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:20,191
我不能想象把这个戴在头上
I can't imagine wearing that over my face.

82
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:23,231
是要挡开嘴边的苍蝇吧
Keeps the flies out of your mouth, I suppose.

83
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,191
卡莱尔夫人来了 马德尔小姐

这是我们这里最柔软的皮手套 卡莱尔夫人
Those are the most supple leather we have, Lady Carlyle.

90
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:54,191
手掌处的磨面能让驾驶者更好抓稳方向盘
The abrasions on the palm allow the driver to grip the steering wheel.

91
00:04:57,191 --> 00:05:00,191
该如何向顾客解释艾格的事呢 马德尔小姐
What are we to say to customers about Agnes, Miss Mardle?

92
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:03,591
你们只需客气有礼地协助客人完成购物

灵感来自于这位伟大赛车手本身
inspired by the great motorist herself.

99
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:17,671
有没有女人在各种场合都可以穿戴的
A woman could wear this anywhere,

100
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,151
包括散步 骑车甚至是参加游园会?

如今你把画带进这个屋子 我必须要给他的
Now you've brought it into the house, I have to give it to him.

135
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:23,391
我有为人妻的责任 而我一直假装没有
I have responsibilities and I've been pretending I haven't -

136
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:25,151
你丈夫忽视你
Your husband neglects you.

137
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:28,711
不 我爱他 而且...

我是你妈妈的一个朋友

144
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:10,631
你在画画!
You're painting!

145
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:13,871
没错 我以前经常画画 在你出生之前
Yes, I used to paint, before you came along.

146
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,891
好了 去你奶奶那里吧 
Now, run along to Grandma. 

147
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:17,871
我正要送坦普尔先生离开
I'm just gonna see Mr Temple out.

148
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:21,511
还有 碧翠丝亲爱的
Oh, and Beatrice darling...

149
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:24,751
别跟任何人说这事
don't tell anyone about this.

150
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:27,631
这是个惊喜
It's a surprise.

151
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:41,151
噢 天啊
Oh no!

152
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:42,911
她会说出去吗
Will she say anything?

153
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:45,431
我不知道 你得走了
I don't know. You have to go.

154
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,431
你必须走了!
You have to go!

155
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,231
我不能走
I can't.

156
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:58,911
你本质根本不是一个旧式女人
You're not a conventional person at heart.

157
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:03,151
不要扼杀你的真我 这可能是你的最后机会
Don't stifle your true self. This may be your last chance.

158
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:10,231
不行
No...

159
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,071
不行
No.

160

你还会再见到我的
You'll see me again.

161

记住这话
You can depend on that.

162
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,720
它能开多快
How fast does it go?

163
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:43,248
每小时四五十英里
Forty, fifty miles an hour.

164
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:44,928
当你在车轮之上的时候
When you're behind the wheel of one of these,

165
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:48,193
将体会到那种速度之快 一切都无法超越你
you feel like you're going so fast, that nothing can touch you.

166
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,334
我也想开汽车 
I wanna drive one. 

167
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:50,313
总有一天会的
You will one day.

168
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,753
我们被发现了 戈顿!
We've been spotted, Gordon!

169
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,993
不要怕 准备好...
Be brave, prepare for....

170
00:09:57,753 --> 00:09:59,433
过来这里 你
Come here, you!

171
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:03,113
我有一个不能告诉你的秘密
I've got a secret that I can't tell you.

172
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,673
真的吗 那我就挠你痒痒 不信你不说 说吧
You do? Well, I'm gonna tickle it out of you! Come on!

173
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:07,393
什么秘密
What is it?

174
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,353
现在几点 很晚了吗
What time is it? Is it late?

175
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:29,753
哈里 你不该现在打开的
Harry, you shouldn't have opened it.

176
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:31,473
这是给你的礼物
It was a present for you.

177
00:10:31,513 --> 00:10:33,753
我还不知道你这么想念作画
I didn't realise that you missed painting.

178
00:10:33,793 --> 00:10:36,593
是啊 我之前也没意识到
Yeah, I don't think I realised it either.

179
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:40,113
是谁画的
Who's the artist?

180
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:44,833
一个叫罗德里克・坦普尔的人
He's called Roderick Temple.

181
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:50,353
他捕捉到了你的神韵 你在哪里见到他的
He caught you well. Where did you meet him?

182
00:10:50,393 --> 00:10:52,153
在国家美术馆
At the National Gallery.

183
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,353
那他在哪里画你的
And where did he paint you?

184
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:58,433
在他的画室里
In his studio.

185
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:03,473
哈里 他只是个男孩
Harry, he's just a boy.

186
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:06,593
如果我认为让他画我有任何不妥的话
If I'd considered it at all inappropriate to be painted by him,

187
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,353
我是根本不会过去的
I wouldn't have gone ahead with it!

188
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:10,513
我是想着你可以挂它在你办公室里
I thought you could hang it in your office,

189
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:12,233
就在你办公桌对面的墙上
on the wall opposite your desk.

190
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,713
但如果你不喜欢它
But if you don't like it...

191
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:19,593
我只是希望能早点知道 仅此而已
I just wish I'd known, that's all.

192
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:22,233
如果你知道了 那就不是惊喜了 对吧
If you had, it wouldn't have been a surprise, would it?

193
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:28,473
你知道我珍惜你胜过一切
You know I value you, more than anything.

194
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:31,393
是的 哈里 我知道
Yes Harry, I know that.

195
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:35,673
你这么早要去哪里
Where are you off to so early?

196
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:38,313
有件事情我必须去做
There's something I need to do.

197
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,473
我到了
I got it.

198
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,193
在这里等我一下 谢谢你
Wait right here for me, thank you.

199
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,899
给我钱 给我钱 
Give me money! Give me money! 

200
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,233
你是头儿对吧
Oh, is that the biggest one?

201
00:11:58,273 --> 00:12:00,953
好了 钱不是一直就在你这里嘛
There we go. You had the money the whole time, right there!

202
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:03,153
哈哈 我要投降了
Ha ha! I'm outnumbered!

203
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:33,673
当然 你要再给自己找份工作
Of course, you'll have to get yourself another job.

204
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:39,913
我是说 我们三个不能只靠乔治那点薪水
I mean, we can't all three of us live off George's wages.

205
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:44,593
你是谁
Who are you?

206
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:47,233
前门开着 我来找艾格尼思・陶勒 
The front door was open. I'm looking for Agnes Towler.

207
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:49,433
我们不允许男访客进来
We don't accept gentlemen callers.

208
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:56,953
在那里等下
Wait in there.

209
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:13,073
听着 我有个朋友 他在波普勒有一间酒吧
Here, I've got a mate, and he owns this pub in Poplar,

210
00:13:13,113 --> 00:13:14,953
他在找酒吧女侍应
and he's looking for a bar maid.

211
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,313
酒吧女侍应? 
A bar maid? 

212
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:18,953
那又怎么了 你能做这个就算幸运了
What's wrong with that? You're lucky to get the offer.

213
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:25,273
有人来找你 我让他在前面客厅等着
Swell downstairs for you.I put him in the front parlour.

214
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:33,193
塞尔福里奇先生
Mr Selfridge!

215
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:34,953
你在这...你在这里做什么
What are... What are you doing here?

216
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,953
我也想问你这个问题
I could say the same for you.

217
00:13:38,873 --> 00:13:40,553
为什么你不在商场里
Why aren't you at the store?

218
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:41,840
我离职了 
I left. 

219
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:44,513
我不接受 我是来带你回去的
I won't accept it. I'm here to take you back.

220
00:13:45,473 --> 00:13:47,433
你很有潜质
You show great potential.

221
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:50,193
你让我回想起刚起步的自己
You remind me of myself when I started out.

222
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:54,513
紧抓每一个机会 对学习充满热情渴望
Grasping for every chance, keen as mustard to learn.

223
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:56,553
你很喜欢 对吧
You love it, don't you?

224
00:13:56,593 --> 00:14:00,633
这种服务顾客 销售商品 运筹帷幄的感觉
The customers, the selling, the feel of the merchandise under your hands.

225
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,433
我喜欢它 胜于一切
I love it more than anything.

226
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:04,473
所以我不想失去你
That's why I don't wanna lose you.

227
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:08,593
回来吧 谁会在乎你父亲做过的事?
Come back. Who cares what happened with your father?

228
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:10,313
只要你不在乎 别人就不会在乎
If you don't, no one else will.

229
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:12,473
但是塞尔福里奇先生 你也不在乎吗 
But Mr Selfridge, don't you?

230
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:15,033
你又不是你父亲
You're not him.

231
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,353
所有的 呃
All the, erm...

232
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:24,873
麻烦在于 我似乎没办法摆脱他
I can't seem to find my way out of it, that's the trouble.

233
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:28,228
每次我设法安排好自己和乔治离开他 
Every time I try to set myself and George up without him, 

234
00:14:28,229 --> 00:14:29,593
他都会找到我们
he finds us.

235
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,473
谢谢你
Thank you.

236
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:39,433
他现在在家吗?
Is he in the house now?

237
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,913
让我和他谈谈
Let me go talk to him.

238
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:12,783
你他妈谁啊? 
Who the bloody hell are you? 

239
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:14,793
哈里・戈顿・塞尔福里奇
Harry Gordon Selfridge.

240
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:19,073
我是来给你提几个条件的
I have certain conditions to put before you.

241
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:20,953
什么条件? 
What conditions? 

242
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,793
马上离开伦敦
Leave London immediately.

243
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:27,233
随便什么地方 只要离这里足够远
Live anywhere you like as long as it's a good distance from here.

244
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:30,953
你他妈以为自己是谁啊?
Who the hell do you think you are?

245
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:33,953
你随便到这里拜访
You come round here,

246
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:38,993
还以为能随便吩咐我做事?
and you think that you can tell me what to do?

247
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:44,193
这些足够付你的车马费
This should pay for your travel,

248
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,353
让你在找到工作之前饱腹了
keep food in your stomach while you look for work.

249
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:51,193
哦 我懂了
Oh, I get it.

250
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:55,553
你喜欢上我女儿艾格
You have taken a bit of a shine to my Aggie.

251
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:59,673
给我说说 她给你提供服务了吗
Tell me, has she offered her services to you?

252
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:02,113
- 啊! - 给我听好!
- Argh! - Understand me!

253
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:05,353
即使你继续酗酒下去 最终流落街头
If you drink your way through this and end up on the street,

254
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:07,873
你也不能回来伦敦骚扰你女儿
you will not return to London to bother your daughter!

255
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:09,593
你不能联系她
You will not contact her,

256
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:12,073
也不能到我商场来找她
you will not come to my store and seek her out.

257
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:17,113
我不会让你毁了她的生活的
I will not let you ruin her life!

258
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:19,353
好了 停!停!停!停!
All right, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

259
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:21,553
停下!停下!求你了!停下!
Stop! Stop! Please! Stop!

260
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:23,593
求你了
Please!

261
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:37,313
我们达成共识了吧
Do we have an agreement?

262
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:48,033
你好 儿子
Hello, son.

263
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:53,633
你爸才不是战争英雄 他也还没死呢
'Your pa ain't no war hero. He ain't dead either!'

264
00:16:53,673 --> 00:16:56,633
我妈说他还活着 住在加州费利蒙市
'My ma says he's alive and living in Freemont...'

265
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,553
爸爸?
Pa?

266
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:15,233
那位女士是谁 爸爸?
Who is that lady, Pa?

267
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:17,993
为什么你不回家和妈妈与我一起住
Why aren't you at home with Ma and me?

268
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:21,353
你妈妈那套高尚的胡话逼我这样的
Your ma's high-toned bullshit did it for me,

269
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:23,193
所以我永远不会回家
that's why I never came home.

270
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:27,553
但你我血肉相连 不论你喜欢与否
But I'm your blood and you're mine, whether you like it or not...

271
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:31,793
塞尔福里奇先生?塞尔福里奇先生?
Mr Selfridge? Mr Selfridge?

272
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,513
塞尔福里奇先生?
Mr Selfridge?

273
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,233
一切都还好吧
Is everything all right?

274
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:51,873
你今晚下班回家时 他就会已经离开
He'll be gone by the time you get back from work this evening.

275
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,263
什么意思 
What do you mean? 

276
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:56,793
就是离开的意思
Just what I say - gone.

277
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:00,393
这种情况下 最好就是一刀两断
In this type of situations, it's best to make a clean break.

278
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,633
没有矫情的告别 懂了吗
No fond farewells. You understand?

279
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:07,073
拿上你的大衣和帽子 我载你去店里
Grab your coat and hat. I'll give you a ride into the store.

280
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:31,833
好了 你喜欢这趟车程吗
Well, did you enjoy the ride?

281
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:34,993
感觉像飞一样
It felt like flying!

282
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:37,953
说不准 或许真有一日 你也会飞呢
Who knows? One day, you may do that as well.

283
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,833
谢谢你 塞尔福里奇先生
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

284
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:46,633
好了 你记住 无需道歉 无需解释
Now, you remember. Don't apologise, don't explain.

285
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:49,353
我总是用这一招应付得很好
As a tactic, it's always worked well for me.

286
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:57,153
- 谢谢你 - 这没什么
- Thank you. - That's all right.

287
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:11,593
看!
Look!

288
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:14,193
她回来做什么
What's she doing back?

289
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,621
我能帮你什么吗 陶勒小姐? 
Can I help you, Miss Towler? 

290
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,873
我回来了 马德尔小姐
I've come back, Miss Mardle.

291
00:19:17,913 --> 00:19:20,353
嗯 恐怕不可能吧 亲爱的
Well, I'm afraid that's not possible, my dear.

292
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:23,873
这是个误会 我没递交辞呈
It was a mistake. I didn't hand in my notice.

293
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:24,524
只要查一下 
If you check, 

294
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:26,256
就会发现我还是塞尔福里奇百货的员工
I'm still employed by Selfridge's,

295
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:27,233
由塞尔福里奇先生聘用
by Mr Selfridge.

296
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:31,513
好吧 当然我得向格罗夫先生确认一下
Right, well, I will have to confirm that with Mr Grove of course.

297
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:33,793
但同时 我们可以先让你上班了
But in the meantime, we can put you to use.

298
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,513
你可以拆开新到的货
You can unpack the new stock.

299
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:37,673
我们正着手做汽车用品的推广
We are embarking on a motor driving promotion

300
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:39,753
还有这些膝毯是刚回来的
and those lap robes have just come in.

301
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:41,593
好的 马德尔小姐
Very good, Miss Mardle.

302
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,233
你不能这样子就回来了
You can't just swan back in.

303
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,433
看来我已经这样做了
Looks like I just have.

304
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,953
- 陶勒小姐 - 你好
- Miss Towler! - Hello.

305
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,073
你回来了
You've returned to us.

306
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:00,913
这真太好了
That is wonderful.

307
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:04,433
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

308
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,633
乔治小伙
George lad.

309
00:20:25,673 --> 00:20:27,129
把这个给我们然后过来 
Give us an 'and over here. 

310
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,913
我正要搬完
I'll just finish this.

311
00:20:27,953 --> 00:20:29,633
马上的!
Now!

312
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:40,753
谢谢你
Thank you.

313
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:58,113
我是爱伦・乐芙 来见塞尔福里奇太太的
Miss Ellen Love, to see Mrs Selfridge.

314
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:08,433
乐芙小姐 真是惊喜
Miss Love, what a pleasant surprise.

315
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:11,561
我恐怕这并不是单纯的社交性拜访 
I'm afraid this isn't a social visit, 

316
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,913
塞尔福里奇夫人
Mrs Selfridge.

317
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:14,873
哦?真是遗憾
Oh? What a pity.

318
00:21:14,913 --> 00:21:18,833
呃 请问你要点咖啡吗
Er, please, can I offer you some coffee?

319
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:25,313
我是来告诉你 你的丈夫对你并不忠诚
I'm here to tell you that your husband has not been faithful to you.

320
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:27,273
他一直与我在谈婚外情
He's having an affair with me.

321
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:33,993
嗯 我想我还是要点咖啡好了
Well, I think I'll have some, anyhow.

322
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,233
这就是你所要说的?
Is that all you can say?

323
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:44,873
好吧 这消息对我来说也不是意外了
Well, this news isn't a surprise to me.

324
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:47,993
我第一次看到你们在一起时 我就知道了
I knew from the moment I first saw you two together.

325
00:21:48,993 --> 00:21:53,993
但是你来告诉我的话
But the fact that you are here, telling me about it...

326
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:56,193
倒是很有趣
Well, that is of interest.

327
00:21:56,233 --> 00:22:00,033
这就意味着 你们的关系基本上已经结束了
It suggests that it's almost certainly over.

328
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,513
你真冷酷无情
You're so cold.

329
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:09,633
难怪哈里到别处寻找激情
No wonder Harry looks for his passions elsewhere.

330
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:12,193
你很想要拥有他 对吧
You've got him bad, haven't you?

331
00:22:14,153 --> 00:22:15,833
他爱我
He loves me.

332
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:17,833
呃 这我倒是不相信
Mm, I very much doubt that.

333
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:20,513
哈里之前就出轨过不少次
Harry has had many similar liaisons.

334
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:23,835
你不过是漫长的舞女队伍中
You are the latest 

335
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:26,753
新来的那一个
in a long line of chorus girls.

336
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,593
我才不是一个舞女
I'm not a chorus girl!

337
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:32,993
那我得承认 或许是我丈夫让你误会了吧
That, I admit, could be a mistake on my husband's part.

338
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:36,513
如果没有别的事的话
Unless there is anything else...

339
00:22:38,713 --> 00:22:41,113
今天是我的家务整理日
..today is my housekeeping day.

340
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:48,273
噢 乐芙小姐正要离开 弗朗瑟
Oh, Miss Love was just leaving, Fraser.

341
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:50,353
请给我一杯咖啡吧
And I'll have a coffee please.

342
00:22:56,593 --> 00:22:58,513
告诉他我来过
Tell him I came.

343
00:22:58,553 --> 00:23:00,953
还有 我不会这么轻易被甩的
And I will not be got rid of that easily.

344
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,490
老大在吗
Is the chief in?

345
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,530
他心情怎样了
How's his mood?

346
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,872
我心情好得很 格罗夫先生 
My mood is just fine, Mr Grove. 

347
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:42,970
怎么了 出什么问题了
Why? What's the problem?

348
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:54,007
装卸区的偷窃?
Thieving in the loading bay?

349
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:56,287
这商场在搞什么鬼
What the hell is wrong with this store?

350
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:58,807
把他们当场抓住 然后狠狠地扔出去
Catch them red-handed and throw them out on their ear.

351
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,527
你是怎么发现的
How did you discover this?

352
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,687
棕榈宫饭店里一位叫维克托 克里诺的侍应
Victor Colleano, a waiter in the Palm Court,

353
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:04,447
他来找我说出他的怀疑
came to me, voiced his suspicions.

354
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:06,247
还好 至少还是有忠诚的人的
Well, at least there's some loyalty.

355
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:08,327
塞尔福里奇先生 我会处理这件事的
I'll deal with it, Mr Selfridge.

356
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:12,767
还有 格罗夫先生
Oh, and Mr Grove...

357
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:14,807
陶勒小姐回来工作了
Miss Towler is back on the pay roll.

358
00:24:14,847 --> 00:24:17,127
但她不是辞职了吗
But she left.

359
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,087
如果没有的话 我也已经解雇她了
If she hadn't, I'd have dismissed her.

360
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:21,047
这里面有点误会
That would have been a mistake.

361
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:23,207
可她父亲当众出丑了
Her father behaved disgracefully.

362
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:27,287
她父亲不会影响到她 起码在我商场里不会
The parent is not the child. Not in my store anyway.

363
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:30,527
那我就是要允许本婷小姐回来
So am I to allow Miss Bunting to return,

364
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:32,887
而且对装卸区的偷窃也眼开眼闭?
and turn a blind eye to these loading bay workers?

365
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:34,847
那可不一样 他们偷了我们的东西
That is different. They stole from us.

366
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:39,287
员工们会不理解 为什么她能回来工作
The staff will not understand why she has been allowed to return.

367
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:41,407
放心 稍后我会解释的
Well, then I will explain it.

368
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,167
今晚召开员工大会
Call a staff meeting this evening.

369
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:45,207
通知所有部门的主管
Let the heads of each department know.

370
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,607
乔治把那些都搬上去
George, load that stuff an' all.

371
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:00,407
乔治 我得和你谈谈 马上的
George, I need to talk to you, urgent! 

372
00:25:00,408 --> 00:25:01,327
你在做什么
What are you doing?

373
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:04,706
你在做什么 
What are you doing? 

374
00:25:04,707 --> 00:25:06,167
这是个阴谋 你还不懂吗
It's a fiddle. Don't you get it?

375
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:09,167
见鬼!
Bloody hell!

376
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,693
那是哈里・塞尔弗里奇先生的财产 
That is the property of Mr Harry Selfridge! 

377
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:13,247
你们被解雇了 滚出去
Out on your ear! Get out!

378
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:14,967
我还一直给那货车装货
I've been loading that van!

379
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:18,007
什么都不要说 要是有人问起 你也别多嘴
Don't say anything. If anyone asks, keep your mouth shut.

380
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:20,499
我还一直当阿尔夫是朋友 
And I thought Alf was my friend. 

381
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,847
我才是你的朋友 好吧
I'll be your friend, alright?

382
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:25,127
- 谢了 维克托 - 但你要醒目点
- Thanks, Victor. - But you need to wise up.

383
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,087
你姐姐丢了工作 正沮丧呢
Your sister's out of a job, feeling cut up.

384
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:29,687
- 她有工作了 - 她找到工作了?
- She's ain't out of a job no more! - She found something?

385
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:32,967
她不是回来这里吗 她回来塞尔福里奇百货了
She's back here, isn't she? She's back at Selfridges.

386
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:35,967
我想要摆置一家人坐在里面
I want to put a whole family in it.

387
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:38,087
父亲 母亲 孩子们
Father, mother, children.

388
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:42,807
汽车要倾斜一点 就好象在飞一样
And the motor will be at an angle, so it is almost flying.

389
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:45,727
要知道 这对孩子来说就跟童话一样
You know for the children, it has to be like a fairy tale.

390
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:49,647
他们要开往公园 在空中挥舞着草帽
They are going to the park, straw hats, which they wave in the air.

391
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:51,567
丝巾在他们身后飘扬
Scarves, flowing out behind them.

392
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,327
男孩穿着水手服
A sailor suit for the boy.

393
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,447
女孩穿着白色背心裙
A little white pinafore for the girl.

394
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:59,287
这一定会很美
It's going to be beautiful!

395
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:02,007
我很高兴你能回来
I'm glad you're back.

396
00:26:03,887 --> 00:26:05,807
你一定很兴奋吧
This could be an exciting time for you.

397
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:08,007
塞尔福里奇先生居然亲自把你带回来
Mr Selfridge has brought you back personally.

398
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:11,847
塞尔福里奇先生真是世上最好的人
Mr Selfridge is THE best man in the world!

399
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:13,567
是吗
He is?

400
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:16,127
他不仅让我回来工作
He hasn't just given me my job back.

401
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,887
他还 呃 他还把我爸爸劝离伦敦了
He's, erm... He's persuaded my dad to leave town.

402
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:22,687
我难以表达我有多高兴
I can't tell you how good that feels.

403
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:28,367
要知道 世界正对你敞开
You know, the world is opening up to you.

404
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:32,727
如果你接触到它 你会有更多可学的
There is so much to learn, if you reach out and take it.

405
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,887
看来 乐芙小姐的时代要终结了
So, Miss Love's day is over.

406
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:08,847
问题是 谁将会取代她呢
The question is - who will take her place?

407
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:12,767
他推翻我所做的每个决定
He overrides every decision I make.

408
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:15,007
我可是他的总务主管 紧急关头
I'm his Chief of Staff! In an emergency,

409
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:17,807
我可能会接手管理这个商场 可他却不重视我
I would take over running the store. But he doesn't value me.

410
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:19,727
罗杰 我肯定他不是不重视的
Roger, I'm sure that's just not true.

411
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,687
也许该提出辞职的人是我
Perhaps it is I who should tender my resignation.

412
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,567
不 你不能这样
No, you mustn't!

413
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:29,407
你是唯一理解我的人
You're the only one who really understands me.

414
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,167
马德尔小姐
Miss Mardle.

415
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:34,167

今天有什么我能帮到您的吗
How can I help you today?

417
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:40,767
我想要看一下足套 开车用的
I'd like to see your collection of foot muffs, for motoring.

418

419
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,407
六点整 楼下开员工大会

420
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:45,919

423
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:52,727
你家人还好吧 可爱的露思琳还好吧
How's the family? How's the charming Rosalie?

424
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:54,075
噢 她很好 谢谢关心 
Oh, she's well, thank you. 

425
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,887
很好 那亲爱的塞尔福里奇老夫人呢
Good. And dear Mrs Selfridge?

426
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:57,607
噢 她也很好
Oh, she's well too.

427
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:00,247
塞尔福里奇 我还不知道你夫人是风雅的人呢
I didn't know you wife was the artistic sort, Selfridge.

428
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:02,447
前几天 我在切尔西艺术俱乐部见到她
I saw her at the Chelsea Arts Club the other day.

429
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:05,167
她和罗德里克・坦普尔聊得真挺开心的
She was having a pretty good time with Roddy Temple.

430
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:08,607
他是在给露思画肖像画呢
He's been painting a portrait of Rose.

431
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,527
噢 真不错啊
Oh, how wonderful.

432
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,687
我还没机会谢谢你
I didn't get a chance to thank you -

433
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:14,607
他是那种不羁的艺术家
He's a Bohemian sort of chap,

434
00:28:14,647 --> 00:28:17,447
而且那个艺术俱乐部真有风情
and The Arts Club is a pretty racy place.

435
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,687
真没想到塞尔福里奇夫人会去那里
I wasn't expecting to see Mrs Selfridge there.

436
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:22,567
托尼 你想法太过时了
Tony, you are so behind the times.

437
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:26,007
自从拉特兰公爵夫人频繁出入那里之后
Since the Duchess of Rutland started to frequent it,

438
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,687
每个人都想被看到出现在那里
everyone who's anyone wants to be seen there.

439
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:31,327
塞尔福里奇夫人去那里真是明智之举
How clever of Mrs Selfridge to gain entrance.

440
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:33,047
好了 允许我先失陪
And now, if you'll excuse me.

441
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:40,727
那真是幼稚
That was childish.

442
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,607
嗯 我很乐在其中
Well, I enjoyed myself.

443
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:46,207
如果你再准备这样做的话 就先告诉我
If you're going to do something like that, tell me first.

444
00:28:48,247 --> 00:28:50,447
就不允许我有自己想法吗
Aren't I even allowed to think for myself?

445
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:52,287
不 重点完全不在于你
No! That's not the point of you at all.

446
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:55,567
事实上 我也不清楚重点是什么了
In fact I'm no longer sure what the point is.

447
00:28:57,887 --> 00:28:59,607
那好了 请允许我失陪了
Well then, if you'll excuse me.

448
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,887
你真是一个多才多艺的男人
You're a man of many talents.

449
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:19,967
你肯定不甘心永远呆在这里 你有什么抱负吗
You can't want to work here forever. Do you have ambitions?

450
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,327
我想要在苏活区开一家自己的餐厅
I want to open my own restaurant in Soho.

451
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:26,207
我有关系 也有些权力
I have friends and some influence.

452
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:29,007
还有个厨师患上了百日咳
I also have a chef with whooping cough.

453
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:30,807
今晚来为我做饭吧
Come and cook for me this evening.

454
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:33,367
或许我们能进一步讨论此事呢
We could perhaps discuss this matter further?

455
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:46,647
塞尔福里奇夫人的肖像画真有意思
What an interesting painting of Mrs Selfridge.

456
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:20,847
布伦金索普小姐
Miss Blenkinsop!

457
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:23,367
给我妻子送四十朵白玫瑰
I'd like 40 white roses sent round to my wife.

458
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:25,247
不 五十朵好了
No, make it 50.

459
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:35,287
我还以为我们昨天都商量好了
I thought we decided yesterday,

460
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:37,447
你不在这里工作是件好事 对我们来说
it was a good thing you don't work here - for us.

461
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:39,767
塞尔福里奇先生亲自过来
Mr Selfridge came over himself.

462
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:43,767
他邀请我回来工作 还用汽车载了我一程
He asked me back, gave me a ride in his motor!

463
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:46,887
维克托 我从未感到如此自豪过
Victor, I've never felt so proud!

464
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:51,687
我想还是可以偷偷约会的
I suppose we can court anyway, on the quiet.

465
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,927
来吧 去拿大衣 我们走吧
Come on, get your coat. Let's get out of here.

466
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:59,007
塞尔福里奇先生要讲话呢
Oh, Mr Selfridge is giving a talk.

467
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:00,807
他不会发现我们的
He won't miss us.

468
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:02,807
我一定要留在这里
I have to stay.

469
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:07,327
那之后呢 我带你去吃晚餐吧
After, then. How about I take you out for a meal?

470
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,313
我叔叔在克勒肯维尔有家餐厅 
My uncle's got this place in Clerkenwell. 

471
00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:10,287
不 今晚不行
I can't, not tonight.

472
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,687
我答应了勒卡雷先生帮他准备明天的橱窗
I said to Mr Leclair that I'd help with the window for tomorrow.

473
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:17,887
那个人打个响指 你就跑着过去
That man snaps his fingers, you come running.

474
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,807
我想要跟你一起
I want to be with you.

475
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:24,847
我也想啊 可我答应勒卡雷先生了
I want that too. But I promised Mr Leclair.

476
00:31:24,887 --> 00:31:26,700
如果我让他失望 
If I let him down, 

477
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:29,647
就等于让塞尔福里奇先生失望
it'd be as if I was letting Mr Selfridge down.

478
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,367
那要是让我失望呢
What about letting me down?

479
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:33,327
你为求目的 什么都可以说
You'll say anything to get your way.

480
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:37,767
要知道 我很厌倦听人摆布
You know, I'm fed up of being told what to do.

481
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,607
我不是要摆布你
I'm not telling you what to do.

482
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:45,927
觐见国王必须穿白色 梅女士说的
You have to wear white to be presented, Lady Mae says.

483
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:48,007
所有年轻女孩都这样穿
All the young girls do.

484
00:31:49,047 --> 00:31:51,247
这件很漂亮 你觉得呢
This one's pretty, don't you think?

485
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:53,487
我觉得这裙裾不怎么好
I'm not sure about the train.

486
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:55,207
一定要有裙裾的
You must have a train!

487
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,127
而且我要开始习惯了 到时真正觐见时
And I have to get used to them. When I eventually get presented,

488
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:01,807
从肩膀算起 裙裾长度要不少于三码 
the train has to be no less than three yards in length from the shoulders.

489
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:03,767
听起来挺繁琐做作的
It sounds rather ornate.

490
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:05,487
这是传统嘛
It's tradition.

491
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:09,007
给您的 塞尔福里奇夫人 
For you, Mrs Selfridge.

492
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:11,847
噢
Oh!

493
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:19,327
白玫瑰 太美了
White roses, they are so beautiful!

494
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,087
哈里送的?
From Harry?

495
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:28,207
谢谢你 弗朗瑟 请先放在水里吧 
Thank you, Fraser. Will you put them in water?

496
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,167
我待会再摆好
I'll arrange them later.

497
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:30,967
它们真美丽
How lovely they are!

498
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:34,887
我真希望找到像爸爸这样的丈夫
I hope I find a husband like Pa.

499
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:56,798
我想要跟大家说点事
I wanted to talk to you about something

500
00:32:56,868 --> 00:32:59,028
对我来说 非常重要的事
that's very important to me.

501
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:01,068
诚实
Honesty.

502
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:03,628
我们这个商场崇尚的是正直诚信
We believe in upright behaviour in this store.

503
00:33:03,668 --> 00:33:05,948
每位顾客都可以信赖于
Every customer can trust

504
00:33:05,988 --> 00:33:08,308
他们所买的东西物有所值
they are getting exactly what they're paying for.

505
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:10,508
他们两个真般配 对吧
They make a lovely couple, don't they?

506
00:33:10,548 --> 00:33:12,468
我以此为傲
I am proud of that!

507
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:14,228
我希望你们也能以此为傲
I hope you are proud too.

508
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:17,868
但即使这里 也有违规行为
But even here, standards can slip.

509
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:21,908
你偷商场的东西 就等于偷自己的东西
You steal from this store, you steal from yourselves.

510
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:26,228
你看 你们都应该知道我是役童起家的
Now, you all probably know I started off as an errand boy.

511
00:33:26,268 --> 00:33:29,108
在我十岁的时候 我一周挣一美元五十分
I was ten years old, I earned a dollar fifty a week.

512
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:31,566
他们提升去我管理货仓的那天 
The day they promoted me to stock boy, 

513
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:32,948
我激动得差点哭了
I damn near cried.

514
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:35,028
而在他们交给我钥匙
And then when they gave me the key

515
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:37,628
让我早上到商场里开门的时候
to open up the store in the morning...

516
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:41,268
那天 我毕生难忘
that's the day that I... I won't forget.

517
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:43,828
经理信任我
The manager trusted me.

518
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:47,628
没有信任 你将一事无成
Without trust, you can't run anything.

519
00:33:49,788 --> 00:33:52,068
我想 我要说的是
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

520
00:33:52,108 --> 00:33:55,268
我不能容忍欺骗的行为
I won't tolerate dishonesty.

521
00:33:57,028 --> 00:34:00,148
但如果你需要帮助 随时来找我
But I'm here for you, if you need my help.

522
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:06,868
最近 一名员工因为她家人的愚蠢行为
Recently, a member of our staff thought she had to leave her position

523
00:34:06,908 --> 00:34:09,428
以为自己必须离职
because a member of her family behaved foolishly.

524
00:34:09,468 --> 00:34:12,380
然而 那并不是她的错 
Now, it wasn't her fault, 

525
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:15,028
所以我不接受她的辞职
so I refused to accept her resignation.

526
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:19,068
若你们有同样情况 我也会为你们做同样的事
I would have done the same for any of you in the same situation.

527
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:22,698
如果你们有麻烦 应找我帮忙 
If you are in trouble, come to me, 

528
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,908
而不是偷我的东西
don't steal from me.

529
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,348
诚实努力 团结互助
Honest endeavour, together.

530
00:34:28,388 --> 00:34:32,548
这才是塞尔福里奇精神
This is the Spirit of Selfridge's.

531
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:06,308
夫人 克里诺先生来见您
Your ladyship, Mr Colleano to see you.

532
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:08,308
我还以为你不来了
I'd given up on you.

533
00:35:08,348 --> 00:35:12,108
可惜 我还带了待煮的鹌鹑肉来
Shame. I've got some spatch-cock quail in here.

534
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:17,068
你带了待煮的鹌鹑肉进来我的客厅?
You've brought spatch-cock quail into my sitting room?!

535
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:19,228
我想到它能搭配青酱一同享用
Thought I'd serve it up with a salsa verde.

536
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:21,068
但如果你不想的话
But if you don't want it...

537
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:23,908
既然你都来了
Well, you're here now.

538
00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:26,068
带克里诺先生去厨房
Show Mr Colleano the kitchen.

539
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,748
呼!
Brooooom!

540
00:35:32,788 --> 00:35:34,468
嘿 爸爸
Hey, Pa!

541
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:37,228
汽车摆到橱窗里了吗 
Is the motor in the window yet? 

542
00:35:37,229 --> 00:35:38,268
明天就摆进去
Going in tomorrow.

543
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:40,068
- 我能去看吗 - 当然可以
- Can I come see it? - You sure can.

544
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:41,788
- 那再见啦 - 好的
- See ya! - Alright!

545
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:48,628
汉弗莱在追赶着什么 他设置了几个陷阱
Humphrey was now after something else. He had made several traps -

546
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,533
你喜欢那些花吗 
Did you like the flowers? 

547
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:53,628
非常喜欢
I loved them.

548
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:56,108
那张卡片上字字真心的
I meant every word of the message.

549
00:35:57,508 --> 00:36:00,308
- 你脸红了 - 才没有
- You're blushing. - I am not!

550
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:03,348
虽然不像那画家亲你时那样红
Not like you did when the painter man kissed you.

551
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:05,628
那时你的脸真的很红
Then you went really red.

552
00:36:19,748 --> 00:36:22,028
你是个好厨师
You're a good cook.

553
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:24,268
坐下
Sit down.

554
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:26,308
给自己斟杯酒吧
Help yourself to a glass of wine.

555
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:38,428
那克里诺先生 还是该叫你
So Mr Colleano... Or may I call you...? 

556
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,228
维克托
Victor.

557
00:36:40,788 --> 00:36:44,856
维克托 跟我聊聊你自己吧 
Victor. Tell me all about yourself. 

558
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:46,108
从头道来
Start from the beginning.

559
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,788
这个很适合你
It suits you.

560
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:13,268
你该多穿鲜艳点
You should wear more colour.

561
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,788
勒卡雷先生
Mr Leclair!

562
00:37:15,828 --> 00:37:19,748
就当是给你今晚辛勤工作的回报吧
I'd like to give it to you for all your hard work tonight.

563
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:21,548
我不能接受这个
I couldn't accept this!

564
00:37:21,588 --> 00:37:25,028
收下吧 我明天会付钱的
Take it. I'll pay for it tomorrow.

565
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:27,748
晚安
Goodnight.

566
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:29,788
谢谢你
Thank you.

567
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:34,748
晚安
Good night.

568
00:38:21,388 --> 00:38:23,108
噢不 你不能这样
Oh no, you don't!

569
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:26,188
我们需要说清楚
We need to have this out.

570
00:38:26,228 --> 00:38:29,828
你和他在这屋子里亲吻就够糟糕的了
It's bad enough that you kiss him in this house -

571
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:32,708
居然还是在碧翠丝面前
but you do it in front of Beatrice!

572
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:34,708
你是她母亲啊
Her own mother.

573
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:36,988
而且 你还骗我
And then, you lied to me.

574
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:39,468
你明明说什么事都没有
You said that everything was gonna be alright.

575
00:38:39,508 --> 00:38:43,308
但却跟一个廉价画家乱搞关系
But you're having an affair, with some two-bit painter!

576
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:46,588
还要把画像送到我办公室去
You even sent the portrait to my office!

577
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,828
你到底怎么了 露思
What's happened to you, Rose?

578
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:53,868
爱伦・乐芙今早来找我
Ellen Love paid me a visit this morning.

579
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:58,348
爱伦 她想要什么
Ellen? What did she want?

580
00:38:59,788 --> 00:39:03,428
你凭什么就只许州官放火 不许百姓点灯啊
Why does it have to be one rule for you and another for the rest of us?

581
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:05,148
她说的一切都不是真的
Whatever she said, it's not true.

582
00:39:05,188 --> 00:39:08,788
你是说你和乐芙小姐没有过关系了
So you're telling me you're not having a relationship with Miss Love?

583
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,908
一切都结束了
It's over.

584
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:22,828
那你呢 你和他在一起过吗
And what about you? Have you been with him?

585
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,628
没有
No.

586
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:29,493
但就算一起过 你要责备我吗 
But would you blame me if I had?

587
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:31,108
我也不过是有样学样
I'd just be following your example.

588
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:32,209
别这样说 
Don't say that. 

589
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,028
这些年来 我独守空房
All these years I have sat at home,

590
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:36,468
而你却在外面纵情声色
while you've gone out and had your fun!

591
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:40,028
你以为我愿意这样吗
Do you think that I want to be this way?

592
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:43,388
你以为我这样很开心吗
Do you think that it makes me happy?

593
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:45,748
你是说我还应该同情你 对吗
Now I'm meant to feel sorry for you, is that right?

594
00:39:45,788 --> 00:39:48,908
好 或许明天我会 但今晚 你就去下地狱吧
Well, maybe I will tomorrow. But tonight...you can go to hell!

595
00:40:05,388 --> 00:40:07,548
再来一杯
Another one.

596
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:09,588
- 喝酒呢 老朋友? - 对
- Drinking, old boy? - Yeah.

597
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:11,948
- 不像你啊 - 还输钱了呢
- Not like you. - And losing too.

598
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:13,828
我输了不少 你要喝点什么?
I've lost a packet. What can I get you?

599
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:15,708
- 威士忌 - 威士忌
- Whiskey. - Whiskey.

600
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,428
出什么事了?
What happened?

601
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:23,068
爱伦今天去找我妻子了
Well... Ellen paid my wife a visit today.

602
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:24,788
噢
Uh-oh!

603
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:31,548
露思认为我一无是处
Rose thinks I'm no damn good.

604
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:34,668
她也许是对的
She may be right.

605
00:40:39,868 --> 00:40:42,028
通常 我都是远离这种毒药的
Normally I stay off this poison.

606
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:48,708
我父亲就很嗜酒
My father had a penchant for it.

607
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:51,188
真的?
Really?

608
00:40:51,228 --> 00:40:53,348
你母亲口中的少校可像圣人一般
You mother paints the Major as a bit of a saint.

609
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:58,108
只能说是 妈妈宁愿记住好时光罢了
Let's just say - Ma likes to remember the good times.

610
00:41:00,268 --> 00:41:02,588
- 我们为什么而喝 - 随便什么吧
- What are we drinking to? - Anything you like.

611
00:41:03,988 --> 00:41:05,668
敬我父亲
To my father!

612
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,388
敬少校
The Major.

613

敬爸爸和他坚持的一切
To Pa and everything that he stood for!

614
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,748
干杯
Cheers.

615
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:19,748
再赌几局吧 这正是我所需要的
More cards, that's what I need.

616
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:21,588
不该回家了吗?
Shouldn't you call it a night?

617
00:41:24,228 --> 00:41:25,908
- 塞尔福里奇先生? - 是
- Mr Selfridge? - Yeah.

618
00:41:25,948 --> 00:41:30,268
有人要见你 抱歉 我拦不住她
Someone to see you. I'm sorry, I couldn't stop her.

619
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:41,628
你来这里做什么
What are you doing here?

620
00:41:46,108 --> 00:41:49,668
我跟你妻子说了 我是来跟你说的
I told your wife, and I'll tell you

621
00:41:50,668 --> 00:41:54,948
我不会这样轻易被抛弃的
I won't be cast off like a piece of nothing.

622
00:41:54,988 --> 00:41:58,348
你吸药吸得神志不清了 快回家吧
You're doped up and you're not thinking straight. Just go home.

623
00:41:59,188 --> 00:42:01,388
公寓没有了你就变了样
The flat's not the same without you.

624
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:07,828
求你了 哈里 跟我走吧
Please, Harry. Come with me.

625
00:42:08,668 --> 00:42:10,348
最后一次
One last time.

626
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:14,308
如果我让你误会了 我很抱歉 真的
I'm sorry if I misled you, I really am.

627
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:17,388
但你要理解 我是有家室的
But you have to understand, I have a family.

628
00:42:22,628 --> 00:42:24,908
你就跟其他那些人一样
You're just the same as all the others!

629
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:29,988
你这个浪荡潦倒的混蛋
You are a whore mongering, low-life bastard!

630
00:42:30,028 --> 00:42:32,348
该走了 朋友 该走了
Time to go, old thing. Time to go.

631
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:34,784
求你别这样对我 哈里 我爱你 
Please don't do this to me, Harry. I love you. 

632
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:35,348
走吧
Come on!

633
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:37,348
- 我爱你 - 走吧
- I love you. - Let's go.

634
00:42:57,428 --> 00:42:59,108
谢谢你 好儿子
Thank you, son.

635
00:43:01,908 --> 00:43:04,788
哈里老兄 我送她上了出租
Harry, old chap? I put her in a cab.

636
00:43:04,828 --> 00:43:07,188
待会我再去看看她是否安好
I'll go and check on her later, see she's all right.

637
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:09,988
回家吧 回去睡吧
Go home. Get some sleep.

638
00:43:35,748 --> 00:43:38,068
我有一个不能告诉你的秘密
'I've got a secret that I can't tell you!'

639
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,788
爱伦?

640
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:01,828
爱伦?
Ellen?

641
00:44:16,308 --> 00:44:17,988
天啊!
Jesus!

642

Come on, let's get you up.

644
00:45:03,028 --> 00:45:05,028
你爸才不是战争英雄呢
'Your father's no war hero.'

645
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:11,708
我似乎没办法摆脱他
'I can't seem to find my way out of it.'

646
00:45:13,868 --> 00:45:16,348
爸爸 你不过是个普通商贩
'Dad, you're nothing but a common huckster.'

647
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:20,868
但你我血肉相连 不论你喜欢与否
'But I'm your blood and you're mine whether you like it or not.'

648
00:45:20,908 --> 00:45:23,108
跟我走吧 走吧
'Come with me... with me...'

649
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:25,828
虽然不像那画家亲你时那样红
Not like you did when the painter man kissed you.

650
00:45:25,868 --> 00:45:28,108
这些年来 我独守空房
'All these years I have sat at home!'

651
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:30,908
潦倒的混蛋!
'..low-life bastard!'

652
00:45:30,948 --> 00:45:33,508
纵情声色
'Have your fun!'

653
00:45:33,548 --> 00:45:35,908
你不过是个普通商贩
'You're nothing but a common huckster.'

654
00:45:39,228 --> 00:45:40,948
不过是个普通商贩
'Nothing but a common huckster.'

655
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,268
你是谁 你是谁
'Who are you?' 'Who are you?'

656
00:45:58,788 --> 00:46:00,628
正如你们所听说的一样
As you all must have heard by now,

661
00:46:06,103 --> 00:46:07,908
商场不能群龙无首 我责无旁贷
This ship needs a Captain. I am that man.

662
00:46:07,988 --> 00:46:10,668
你的勒卡雷先生很难接受 对吧
Taking it bad, isn't he, your Mr Leclair?

663
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:12,428
他不是我的勒卡雷先生
He's not MY Mr Leclair.

664
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:15,148
妇女参政权论者明天会路经这栋楼
