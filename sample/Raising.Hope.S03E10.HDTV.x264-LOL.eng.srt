00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:11,234
JIMMY:
<i>Now that Hope was three,</i>

3
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:13,019
<i>this was probably gonna be</i>
<i>the first Christmas</i>

4
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:14,270
<i>she remembered.</i>

5
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,857
<i>So I worked double shifts</i>
<i>to be able to afford</i>

6
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:19,242
<i>everything she wanted.</i>

7
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:22,395
<i>Of course, I wasn't just</i>
<i>sacrificing my time,</i>

8
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,697
<i>I was sacrificing</i>
<i>my self-respect.</i>

9
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:25,999

10
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,283

11
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:29,085

♪ And a low-priced New Year!

15
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,961
I'm guessing she has a coupon or two?

16
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:39,712
Indeed.
BARNEY: I'll take this.

17
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:41,580
Sabrina,

18
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:44,717
extreme couponers need to be
dealt with by extreme cashiers.

19
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:45,635
Virginia.

20
00:00:45,686 --> 00:00:46,636
Barney.

21
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:47,804
What have you got today?

22
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:49,472
I have half off from the manufacturer,

23
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:50,523
which is stackable.

24
00:00:50,557 --> 00:00:52,892
That means she can combine
it with other coupons.

25
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:56,562
So, I will also be using
this 20% off store coupon,

26
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:59,866
which I will them combine with a BOGO.
Buy one get one free.

27
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,201
What do you need with this
many dryer sheets, anyway?

28
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:03,403
They have thousands of uses.

29
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:04,487
They're great for getting rid of bugs.

30
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:06,122
You can use them as air fresheners.

31
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:08,207
Deodorant, napkins.
And if you're in a pinch,

32
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:10,460
you can use one as a coffee filter.

33
00:01:10,494 --> 00:01:11,711
You're abusing the system.

34
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:12,962
The grocery store economy

35
00:01:12,997 --> 00:01:14,330
is very volatile.

36
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:15,581
I'm already one broilworm

37
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:17,300
larvae outbreak in Southeast Asia away

38
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:18,668
from losing half my produce section,

39
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,004
and now you're trying
to kill me in home and garden.

40
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:22,472
Yeah, well, I really
wouldn't worry about it

41
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:24,057
because the world as we know it

42
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:26,625
is going to end on Friday, Barney.

43
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:28,961
So while the rest of you
are fighting each other

44
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,681
over a sip of water
from a radioactive puddle,

45
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:34,650
I will be sitting safely
in my survival bunker

46
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:38,137
sipping a nice, hot cup
of static-free,

47
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:41,491
spring-rain-scented java.

48
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:42,859
JIMMY: <i>Did I not mention my mother thinks</i>

49
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:44,694
<i>the world is gonna end next Friday?</i>

50
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:47,246
<i>It all started about two years ago.</i>

51
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,682
MAN: And when you look at the
fact that the Mayan calendar

52
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:52,685
ends on December 21, 2012,

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,254
the only logical conclusion
you can come to is

54
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,957
the world is going to end.

55
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,692
Can that be true?

56
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:01,794
Now, let's take a few callers--
Wilfrid in Camden County.

57
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,480
WILFRID: What you're saying
is totally true, man.

58
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,916
I heard it on a different
radio show yesterday.

59
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,251
Oh, my God.

60
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:09,952
It's true.

61
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:11,788
Are we all gonna die?

62
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:13,139
That's my worst fear--

63
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:15,224
to be here one day and gone the next.

64
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,110
Like I never even existed.

65
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:20,563
I guess this means I need
to get my bucket list started.

66
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:21,748
Bucket list?

67
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:22,899
You're 114 years old.

68
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,100
What the hell have you been waiting for?

69
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:26,852
Hey, I didn't know
what a bucket list was.

70
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,154
The movie just came out.

71
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:31,240
By the way,
spoiler alert-- it sucks.

72
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,626
The good news is
I found out about this now.

73
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,244
Now, I've got a plan.

74
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:38,247
The Chance family is
gonna be ready for this.

75
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:41,584
<i>Mom was serious about us preparing,</i>

76
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:44,170
<i>so she gave us all jobs.</i>

77
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:46,539
<i>Dad was in charge of handling</i>
<i>any looters, mutants or aliens.</i>

78
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,174
<i>So he'd know how to reason with them,</i>

79
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,375
<i>he tried to learn</i>

80
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:52,562
<i>some down-home psychology</i>
<i>from Dr. Phil.</i>

81
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:53,879
Aw, man.

82
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:56,065
He just said, "You can lie to yourself

83
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,568
"and pretend you're on a
first-class flight to London,

84
00:02:58,602 --> 00:03:00,019
"but everybody else knows you're

85
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:02,721
on a freight train
to Stupid Town."

86
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,491
That should make her stop huffing paint.

87
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:07,026
<i>And if reasoning didn't work,</i>

88
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,561
<i>Dad was taking a Krav Maga class</i>

89
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:10,196
<i>down at the community center.</i>

90
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,532
Come on, use your extra arms.

91
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:14,584
He's got to be prepared
for anything these aliens

92
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:16,335
and/or mutants throw at us.

93
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:20,206
Kick him in the neck, Burt.

94
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,508
We have no idea where these
aliens' testicles will be.

95
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:24,794
(groans)

96
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:29,048
<i>And since I was the best in the</i>
<i>family at the game Operation,</i>

97
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:32,218
<i>Mom put me in charge of</i>
<i>post-apocalyptic first aid.</i>

98
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:34,253
So, hey, before you tape
his stomach closed,

99
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:37,190
can you show me which one
of those things is his liver?

100
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:39,642
<i>Mom set up a survival bunker</i>
<i>in the cellar and filled it</i>

101
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:41,777
<i>with all the things</i>
<i>necessary to survive,</i>

102
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:44,780
<i>which she paid for</i>
<i>using extreme couponing.</i>

103
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,232
We're gonna be billionaires if I'm right

104
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,451
about dental floss
being the new currency.

105
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:50,269
(game buzzes)
<i>And Maw Maw was figuring out</i>

106
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:52,538
<i>everything she wanted to do</i>
<i>before she died.</i>

107
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:55,208
Hey, Maw Maw, I found a coupon
for the tattoo parlor.

108
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:56,942
Wasn't that on your bucket list?

109
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,277
Well, it was until this morning.

110
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,164
(laughs)

111
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:03,883
Now, all I got to do
is go car-surfing,

112
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:06,636
get in a fistfight,
sleep with a black man

113
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,555
and do stand-up comedy.

114
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,373
(game buzzes)

115
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:12,642
(groans) Stupid breadbasket.

116
00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:15,178
<i>Even when we had major changes</i>
<i>in our lives,</i>

117
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:17,847
<i>we were still planning</i>
<i>for the end of the world.</i>

118
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:22,235
Hey, Sabrina, right?

119
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:25,188
Oh, yeah, Johnny, right?

120
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:26,455
Uh, close enough.

121
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,407
Do you guys have any more
Band-Aids in the back?

122
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:31,027
I'm supposed to get like 600 boxes.

123
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,113
Planning on skinning your knees
a few times, are you?

124
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:36,165
(laughs) Nah, nah.

125
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,900
We're stocking up
for the end of the world.

126
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:39,519
I'm sorry, what?

127
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:43,789
Dad, the cute girl at the
grocery store told me

128
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:45,841
that all this stuff about the
end of the world is a fallacy,

129
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:48,177
and fallacy doesn't mean
"penis," it means "not true."

130
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:49,512
Shh. Watch it.

131
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:51,681
You want your mother to hear you?

132
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:53,883
Of course the world's not gonna end.

133
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:56,352
You knew this?
For how long?

134
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:58,804
For years-- went to the
library and checked it out.

135
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:01,607
It's all a big hoax like bigfoot
or the Loch Ness monster,

136
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:03,309
or the Underwater Gorilla.

137
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:05,311
Then why are we stockpiling food

138
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:07,396
and learning how to fight
aliens and/or mutants?

139
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:08,998
Jimmy, we got four-years worth

140
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:10,399
of ice cream sandwiches in the basement.

141
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,902
Plus I get to spend my weekends
fake-fighting aliens.

142
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:14,203
It's a win-win.

143
00:05:14,238 --> 00:05:16,021
Aw, I guess you're right.

144
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,908
Besides Rosa's family's
totally convinced.

145
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,076
We're gonna look like jerks if we don't

146
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:21,494
at least pretend to believe.

147
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:23,346
And when the super volcano blows,

148
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,882
the entire world will be covered
in ash and all of humanity will

149
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:30,553
be plunged into darkness and
despair for thousands of years.

150
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:32,004
It's true.

151
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:34,173
Enjoy your caramel crunch.

152
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:39,262
Mommy, we're all gonna die!

153
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:44,650
<i>So rather than have</i>
<i>a big fight with Mom,</i>

154
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:45,901
<i>we just humored her.</i>

155
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:47,486
Look what I bought online.

156
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:50,106
Turns urine into drinkable water.

157
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:52,275
It's used but I got a good deal.

158
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:55,278
Just needs a few go-rounds
in the dishwasher.

159
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:58,564
Six more months and this'll all be over.

160
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,341
(clicking tongue, squeaks)

161
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,209
(grunts)

162
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:11,594
(groans)

163
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:13,145
Nice work.

164
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,465
No matter where I had testicles,
that would have hurt them.

165
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:21,137
Three more months and it'll all be over.

166
00:06:21,188 --> 00:06:23,522
Drill! Evacuation drill!

167
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,641
Sabrina, if you're gonna become
a member of this family,

168
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,259
you need a job-- you're in
charge of figuring out how to

169
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,562
cook anything that survives
the initial... whatever.

170
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:30,946
Now, everybody get out
on the front lawn,

171
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:32,698
tuck yourselves into a little
ball and hold your breath.

172
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,617
You should be up to
three minutes by now.

173
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:39,789
(yawns): One more month
and this'll all be over.

174
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:42,124
<i>Which brings us to today...</i>

175
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,626
Offer expires January fourth.

176
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,328
Coupon must be presented
at time of purchase.

177
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:48,881
Each coupon good for a maximum
of 12 boxes per customer!

178
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:51,667
Customer can use
a maximum of four coupons,

179
00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:54,286
which means you and Burt
can only buy 96 boxes.

180
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:55,621
You need to put half these back.

181
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,223
Hopes buying some of these.

182
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,981
You'll have to put 48 boxes back.

183
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:07,516
Jimmy, get in line.

184
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,435
(groans)

185
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:12,104
Three more days and it's all over.

186
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:13,823
Sure, for everybody else.

187
00:07:13,857 --> 00:07:17,526
For us, it's just the beginning.

188
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,790
JIMMY:
<i>With all the craziness</i>

189
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:28,075
<i>of preparing for the world to end,</i>

190
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,359
<i>it was easy to forget that</i>

191
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:31,795
<i>Christmas was right around the corner.</i>

192
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:33,547
<i>But I was still</i>
<i>determined to make Hope's</i>

193
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:35,799
<i>first Christmas memory a special one.</i>

194
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,034
<i>And that meant explaining</i>
<i>all the traditions to Hope,</i>

195
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:40,087
<i>and making sure we did</i>
<i>every last one of them.</i>

196
00:07:40,138 --> 00:07:41,338
And then he leaves

197
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:44,257
presents under the Christmas
tree for everyone,

198
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:46,393
but especially you.

199
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:48,178
(Maw Maw whooping)

200
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:53,650
Only six more days till Christmas,

201
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,652
and then you get to get the big piece.

202
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:58,271
Oh-oh-oh, not yet, honey.

203
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:00,140
We have to wait.

204
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:02,075
Can you please stop?

205
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,894
Make me, Nancy boy.

206
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:06,663
I've only got three things
left on my bucket list,

207
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:09,533
and I need to get into a fistfight.

208
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,369
Maw Maw, I'm not gonna fight
you-- you're a million

209
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:13,954
years old and you broke your pelvis

210
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:15,172
falling off the roof of that car.

211
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:16,556
I'm sorry, what did you just say?

212
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,375
I'm not fluent in wussy.

213
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:22,179
I'll fight you.

214
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:24,998
You will?

215
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:26,416
Oh, yeah.

216
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:27,684
I've been wanting
to punch you in the face

217
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:28,852
ever since you told me I looked

218
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:31,021
like Ralph Macchio in drag.

219
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:36,143
Let's do this.

220
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:41,781
Hey, hey!

221
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:43,867
Fistfight's happening.

222
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:45,235
I'd be careful, Sabrina.

223
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:46,870
Maw Maw doesn't always
play by the rules.

224
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:49,873
I think I'll be all right.

225
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:52,626
(groans) Aw!

226
00:08:58,132 --> 00:08:59,249
Ow!

227
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:02,969
(grunting and groaning)

228
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:07,224
No!
You're gonna have to be

229
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:08,625
tougher than that, you skinny little

230
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:10,477
Ralph-Macchio-looking bitch!

231
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:13,063
(yelling)

232
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:15,599
Well, we're all stocked up.

233
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,484
Guess there's nothing left to do

234
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:18,801
but celebrate Christmas tomorrow,

235
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,070
and then climb into our

236
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:21,988
hazmat suits and wait
for the Apocalypse.

237
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:24,074
What do you mean celebrate
Christmas tomorrow?

238
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:26,409
It's the 20th--
Christmas is the 25th.

239
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:27,410
Jimmy,

240
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:29,162
by the time the 25th rolls around,

241
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:31,281
Santa Claus will just
be a desperate old man

242
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:33,500
in a red suit peddling reindeer meat.

243
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:35,835
We're having Christmas tomorrow.

244
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,704
Sounds good to me, honey.

245
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,005
Good thinking.

246
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,041
All right, this has gone too far.

247
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,959
I am not celebrating
Christmas tomorrow night.

248
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:44,611
We've invested two years in this.

249
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:45,795
We're not backing down now.

250
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:48,215
We're still gonna have real Christmas.

251
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:50,884
Consider this practice Christmas.

252
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:53,103
We'll all wear matching pajamas,
we'll open some gifts.

253
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:54,354
It'll make your mother happy.

254
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:55,855
Fine.

255
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,725
But I'm not giving Hope her real
presents until actual Christmas.

256
00:09:58,776 --> 00:09:59,893
Do whatever you want.

257
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:01,728
All I care is that
we're done by 8:00.

258
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:02,946
Your mother and I have quite

259
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,648
the End of the World Eve
Love Fest planned.

260
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:07,234
I'll spare you the graphic
specifics of the things

261
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:09,286
I'm gonna do to your mother.

262
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,738
It involves quite a bit of pudding.

263
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:23,049
I hope you didn't love her for her face.

264
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:25,368
'Cause she ain't so pretty no more.

265
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:27,504
<i>So reluctantly, the next day we</i>
<i>all celebrated fake Christmas</i>

266
00:10:27,538 --> 00:10:31,057
<i>with all of our Christmas traditions.</i>

267
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:33,977
<i>And as it turned out,</i>
<i>there were actually</i>

268
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:37,097
<i>some traditions</i>
<i>I didn't mind doing twice.</i>

269
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:39,882
<i>Like opening gifts...</i>

270
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,685
Aw...

271
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,987
<i>A Hundred and One Recipes for Insects.</i>

272
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:49,075
(both gasp)

273
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,078
Sabrina, you shouldn't have.

274
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:53,947
You know, I just thought
when we were running

275
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:56,032
through crowds of people
whose skin was melting off,

276
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:58,702
this would be a nice way
to keep things light.

277
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:00,103
This is awesome!

278
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:02,422
Somebody rip a big one.
Let's see if this thing works.

279
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:05,458
JIMMY: <i>...or watching</i> Ernest Saves
Christmas <i>three times in a row.</i>

280
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,510
(laughing breathlessly)

281
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:13,350
<i>But there are some traditions</i>
<i>you can only do once.</i>

282
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:15,969
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

283
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,438
You can't eat the big chocolate
until the 25th.

284
00:11:18,472 --> 00:11:19,773
It's not the 25th.

285
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:22,776
Yeah, but we're celebrating
Christmas tonight, so...

286
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:27,731
You let her eat 21 through 24?

287
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:28,931
Of course I did.

288
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,433
What do we have to wait for?
It's Christmas.

289
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:32,769
No, it's not.
It's not Christmas.

290
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:35,155
Christmas is in five days, and that's
when we're going to celebrate it.

291
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:37,490
I don't want her first memories
of Christmas to be weird.

292
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,492
She's going to eat the proper chocolate

293
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:41,211
on the proper day.

294
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,549
What are you doing?

295
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:47,667
I'm gonna get the chocolate hard,

296
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:48,951
break it off my finger,

297
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:50,387
and then put pieces of it
back in the calendar.

298
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:52,172
Jimmy...

299
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:53,506
you're being silly.

300
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:55,759
I'm being silly?

301
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:57,560
We've got three cases of
dog food in the basement

302
00:11:57,595 --> 00:11:59,145
labeled "zombie bait."

303
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,597
So what are you saying?

304
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:01,731
You don't think something's
gonna happen tomorrow?

305
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:03,483
No. No, I don't, Mom.

306
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:04,851
The only thing I think is gonna happen

307
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:06,069
is that you're gonna feel like an idiot

308
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:07,570
for eating 21 through 24.

309
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:08,655
Because you're crazy.

310
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,408
I'm not crazy.

311
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:13,076
Oh, please.

312
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,577
We all think you're crazy.

313
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:15,829
Even Maw Maw thinks you're crazy.

314
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:17,664
Burt, is that true?

315
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,250
Does everybody think I'm crazy?

316
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:21,818
Not I.

317
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:23,670
I think you're spot on
with this whole thing.

318
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:24,921
JIMMY:
Really?

319
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:26,256
You think that, huh?

320
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,557
Yes, I do.

321
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:29,158
Okay.

322
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:32,328
Wouldn't even worry about Jimmy.

323
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:35,215
He's not gonna last two weeks
against the mutant spider army.

324
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:36,599
So... Jimmy, give me that.

325
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:38,551
What's that?

326
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:39,636
(grunts)

327
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,804
Since we're celebrating Christmas early,

328
00:12:40,838 --> 00:12:43,005
I thought we should
open up all the gifts.

329
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:45,275
Dad hid this in my room.

330
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,394
Looks like it has your name on it, Mom!

331
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,864
Ow, ow. Ow.

332
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:52,182
Pie-of-the-Month Club?

333
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:54,067
"I know you're disappointed

334
00:12:54,118 --> 00:12:55,985
"that the world didn't end,

335
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,704
"but at least we have pie.

336
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:00,206
Love, Burt."

337
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:07,297
You...

338
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,866
Three hours.

339
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:11,918
You couldn't wait three more hours?

340
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:14,754
And there goes my End of
the World Eve Love Fest.

341
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:17,006
Ah, I can't believe I was nice enough

342
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,308
to spare you the graphic specifics

343
00:13:18,342 --> 00:13:20,894
of what I was gonna do to your mother.

344
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:28,852
(whispering)

345
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,745
Live with that image for the
rest of your life, big mouth.

346
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:52,287
Well, it's ten seconds to midnight, Mom.

347
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:53,418
Maybe we should talk.

348
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:54,979
I would hate to be mad at each other

349
00:13:55,023 --> 00:13:57,324
when absolutely nothing happens.

350
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:58,526
That's funny, Jimmy.

351
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:00,494
You're a regular Tosh period zero.

352
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:01,696
Three...

353
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:03,247
two...

354
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:04,615
one.

355
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:08,436
Good night.

356
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:12,540
No one said it would happen
exactly at midnight.

357
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:15,126
We got 24 hours.

358
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,678
♪

359
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:23,684
Morning.

360
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:26,437
Ah, another beautiful day, huh?

361
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:29,473
Guess the Grim Reaper
must've hit the snooze button.

362
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:31,675
Shut up.

363
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:32,977
Hey, baby!

364
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:34,511
(gags)

365
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:36,697
I tried your pee water thingy.

366
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:38,348
(gags)

367
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:41,736
It kind of works.

368
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:42,903
Smart purchase.

369
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:47,108
(retches)

370
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,334
Oh, hi, Mr. and Mrs. Gutierrez.

371
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:01,371
This is not to you.

372
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:02,807
Not for you.

373
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:09,764
Kim Kardashian hasn't tweeted all day.

374
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:12,549
The government obviously has
all the important celebrities

375
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,551
hidden in an underground bunker.

376
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:16,337
(computer chimes)

377
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:18,072
Oh, wait, never mind.

378
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:20,091
She was just getting a colonic.

379
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:30,251
(muffled):
Thanks.

380
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:37,708
(music winds down, stops)

381
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:41,879
(music resumes)

382
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,267
Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom!

383
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:48,018
Mom!

384
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:50,137
Everything's fine.

385
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:51,138
(laughs)

386
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:52,189
Ah!

387
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:02,783
Guys. Guys! Guys!

388
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:05,653
(Jimmy chuckling)

389
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,404
Hey!

390
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:10,574
Those marshmallows are not toys, okay?

391
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:13,210
They're only to be used as possum bait

392
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:15,379
or for celebrating the victory
of the surviving humans

393
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:17,731
over the mutant aliens
with s'mores, okay?

394
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:19,250
VIRGINIA:
Damn it!

395
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:26,140
Hey.

396
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:28,092
So, nothing happened.

397
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:29,727
It's not the end of the world.

398
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:31,061
(laughs)

399
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:32,479
I can't believe this.
This totally sucks.

400
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:36,934
Look, I know you planned for
this to happen and everything,

401
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:38,936
but aren't you the tiniest bit glad

402
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,154
the world isn't over?

403
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:41,355
No, I'm not.

404
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:44,859
This was supposed to be my moment, Burt.

405
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,694
I was finally going to show Jimmy

406
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:48,245
that I could be a good mom.

407
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,697
Jimmy thinks you're a good mom.

408
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,165
Oh, please.

409
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,666
Every week he dredges up

410
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,119
some parenting disaster from our past.

411
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:56,871
How I didn't breastfeed him,

412
00:16:56,922 --> 00:16:59,373
how his first steps were
down a flight of stairs,

413
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:02,009
how we forget him that time
at a Whitesnake concert.

414
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:03,043
Oh, come on.

415
00:17:03,094 --> 00:17:04,345
What nine-year-old gets to say

416
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:06,683
they spent a week on
the Whitesnake tour bus?

417
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,717
I just thought that he would
look at me as a good mom,

418
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:12,770
if three-quarters of the human
population was wiped out

419
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:14,605
and I was prepared.

420
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:23,981
Just for the record,

421
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:26,408
her pelvis was broken before I got here.

422
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,803
Oh...

423
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:41,156
You got me dryer sheets.

424
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,357
Get used to it.

425
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:44,743
You're getting them
for the next 374 years.

426
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:46,528
(knock on door)

427
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,534
Ai, thank God you're here.

428
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:54,971
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

429
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:57,839
Since the world was going to
end, we sold everything

430
00:17:57,874 --> 00:17:59,925
and bought one-way first class
tickets to Disney World,

431
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:03,178
so we could watch the end of
civilization from Tomorrowland.

432
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:05,013
We thought it would be ironic.

433
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:06,664
ROSA:
But then, when nothing happened,

434
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:09,334
we had no money, and no way to get back.

435
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:10,835
It's hard to get picked up hitchhiking

436
00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:12,020
with an alpaca.

437
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:14,055
(alpaca hawks)

438
00:18:14,107 --> 00:18:15,507
What was that?

439
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,726
He tried to spit at you,
but he's dehydrated.

440
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:19,945
ROSA:
What are we going to do?

441
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,196
Carlos sold his ice cream truck,

442
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,680
I quit my job, we spent all our money,

443
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:25,016
and all we have to show for it
is feet full of blisters

444
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:28,537
and a souvenir mug
we've been using as a toilet.

445
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:29,871
Jimmy, go get
your first-aid kit.

446
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:31,039
I'll get you guys some water.

447
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:33,625
Burt, calm her down.

448
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:36,461
(imitating Dr. Phil):
You are gonna be okay.

449
00:18:36,496 --> 00:18:39,864
You're worried that you won't
come back from this?

450
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:42,334
I'm here to assure you

451
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:45,036
that dog don't hunt!

452
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:47,088
What is he talking about?

453
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,090
I don't know.

454
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:51,643
But it's very folksy and comforting.

455
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:52,928
(hawks)

456
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:55,313
JIMMY: <i>Without even
really thinking about it</i>

457
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:57,349
<i>we all sprang into action.</i>

458
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:05,323
<i>Dad found someone who didn't</i>
<i>mind using recycled water.</i>

459
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:11,413
Why are you recycling his pee?

460
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:13,248
You could just give him
water from the tap.

461
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:14,749
We're settling an old score.

462
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:16,401
Isn't that right, buddy?

463
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,670
(bellows)

464
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:20,205
Damn it.

465
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:22,674
Wacky Mexican pony, two;
Burt, zero.

466
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,125
Oh!

467
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:31,516
JIMMY: <i>With so many people in the house,</i>

468
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:32,968
<i>we had to figure out creative ways</i>

469
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:34,186
<i>to be able to afford to feed everyone.</i>

470
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,271
I hope everybody enjoys this.

471
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:37,906
It's glowworm tetrazzini.

472
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,224
And if I cooked it right,

473
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:40,525
there should still be
a little glow left.

474
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,261
ALL:
Ooh...

475
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:46,364
JIMMY:
<i>We let Rosa and her family</i>

476
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:48,766
<i>move into the survival bunker</i>
<i>we weren't using</i>

477
00:19:48,784 --> 00:19:50,785
<i>until they were back on their feet.</i>

478
00:19:53,656 --> 00:19:55,790
<i>It took a while,</i>
<i>but Mom sold all the stuff</i>

479
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:57,542
<i>she'd been stockpiling,</i>
<i>and used the money</i>

480
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:59,578
<i>to help Carlos buy back</i>
<i>his ice cream truck.</i>

481
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:03,615
<i>And before we knew it,</i>

482
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,500
<i>Rosa's family was back in business.</i>

483
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:07,385
<i>It turns out Mom did</i>
<i>have us all prepared</i>

484
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,970
<i>to deal with a disaster.</i>

485
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:12,724
<i>The disaster just turned out</i>
<i>to be someone else's.</i>

486
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,309
I gotta say, Mom...

487
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:16,478
maybe you're not as crazy as I thought.

488
00:20:16,512 --> 00:20:18,630
Why, 'cause Rosa's crazier?

489
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:20,515
The world still didn't end, Jimmy.

490
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,400
I'm not gonna start patting
myself on the back

491
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:24,319
'cause Rosa's a bigger idiot than I am.

492
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:25,904
Sure, the world didn't end,

493
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,822
but when you thought it was going to,

494
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:30,141
you didn't blow everything
to have fun, like Rosa did.

495
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,494
You made sure your family was protected.

496
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:34,829
That's pretty cool.

497
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:36,698
That is pretty cool.

498
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,167
Hey, where's Maw Maw?

499
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:40,368
I don't know.

500
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:42,987
She said she had something to do.

501
00:20:44,712 --> 00:20:46,879
If you ever voted for a president

502
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:49,332
whose picture's on money,

503
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:51,167
you might be an old person.
(crowd laughs)

504
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:55,004
If the expiration date
on your can of peaches

505
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:58,107
has Roman numerals on it?

506
00:20:58,109 --> 00:21:00,293
You might be an old person.

507
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:03,396
You ever had a three-way
with Lewis and Clark,

508
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:05,181
might be an old person.

509
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:06,532
(crowd laughs)

510
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,154
If you throw away your change purse

511
00:21:08,274 --> 00:21:10,495
and start keeping your quarters
in your elbow,

512
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:13,378
you might be an old person.

513
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:16,368
If you ever bought or sold

514
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,272
a human being...

515
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:21,494
You might be an old person.

516
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:24,474
You might be an old person.
