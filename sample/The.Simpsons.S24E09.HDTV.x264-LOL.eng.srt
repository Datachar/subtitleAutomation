00:01:07,374 --> 00:01:10,009
Learn Zone? Mom, you said
we were going someplace fun.

5
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:12,430
Yeah, Mom,
you promised!

6
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:14,822
Homer, I told you,
don't call me "Mom."

7
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:16,589
Sorry, Mrs. Simpson.

8
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:26,449
Ooh!

9
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:28,051
This isn't
a learn zone.

10
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:29,469
Darn it,
it's a fun place!

11
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:30,987
- Yay!
-  Yay!

12
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:36,993
For maximum safety,
all children must wear

13
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:38,978
anti-kidnapping bracelets.

14
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:42,999
Is this a kid
<i>you'd</i> pay ransom for?

15
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:45,268
Dad, what would you do
if you got my ear in the mail?

16
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:46,770
I don't know.
Feed it to the dog?

17
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:47,971
You'd have
to wrap cheese around it.

18
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:50,407
Don't you tell me
how to feed you to the dog!

19
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:02,802
Whoa!

20
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,487
Where do they go?

21
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:05,522
Whoa!

22
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:09,309
Welcome to the Mormon Church,

23
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:11,344
America's most respectable cult.

24
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:13,913
Keep an eye on
the kids, Homer.

25
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:15,915
Can I keep an eye
on that kid?

26
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:18,868
He's fabulous.

27
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:20,220
Bart and Lisa.

28
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:22,989
Oh! It's always <i>my</i> kids.

29
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:24,707
Yay!

30
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:27,143
Where'd they go?

31
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:28,812
Oh. Hmm.

32
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:31,481
Almost.

33
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,184
Holy moley.

34
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:35,985
What the...?!

35
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:38,872
Oh, it's hopeless!

36
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:40,106
What's hopeless?

37
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:41,841
Who the hell are you?

38
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:45,979
Dad, come up, come up!
Pretty, pretty please!

39
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:47,347
Absolutely not!

40
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:49,349
My adult frame
is simply too large.

41
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:50,850
Come on, Dad!
No! Never!

42
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:52,719
Come on, Dad!
Fine.

43
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:54,721
Here I come.

44
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:56,306
Crawling.

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,324
So... painful.

46
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:00,894
Duck walk.

47
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:03,379
Infinitely worse. Ooh!

48
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,201
Only wanted...
to be fun.

49
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:09,469
Shh, shh, shh.

50
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:11,921
Soon you'll know peace.

51
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:19,679
I made it, kids!

52
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:23,516
I am king
of Learnington Castle!

53
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:25,685
We tricked you.

54
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,253
Eat Nerf, Homeboy!

55
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:31,274
Real... mature...!

56
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,377
Yay!

57
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:37,647
Ralphie!

58
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:40,717
Huh? Hmm.

59
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:42,368
What cool kid
thing's in here?

60
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:44,687
No kids. That's what's cool.

61
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:51,461
I have a phone.
It's very tiny.

62
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:53,730
Ain't no shame
in being poor, boy.

63
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:56,633
What's pitiful is
if you is ignorant.

64
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:59,736
Is these mice pillows here
for the taking?

65
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,037
I hate working here.

66
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:02,539
At least at Krustyburger,

67
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:04,724
you could burn yourself
and go home.

68
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:09,362
Unauthorized child departure.

69
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:10,563
Lockdown mode initiated.

70
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,705
Another stupid kid got out.

71
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:20,773
I can't tell the manager.

72
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:23,076
I <i>am</i> the manager. Duh!

73
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,261
We're locked in!

74
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:29,782
These lasers are nothing more
than colored lights!

75
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,985
Calm down, everyone.
Calm down.

76
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:34,153
I'm sure they'll have us
out of here soon.

77
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:36,055
Until then, why don't we bond

78
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,957
by sharing
our childbirth experiences.

79
00:04:37,992 --> 00:04:40,326
The nurses
were so great.

80
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:42,896
My husband held
my hand the whole time.

81
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,615
See? All you need
to get through a crisis

82
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,517
is a little
friendly conversation.

83
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:50,153
Bet you the dads
are doing the same thing.

84
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:56,259
The sneeze guard is broken!

85
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:58,261
There is no law!

86
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:00,663
Oh, I just came here
to pick up my daughter.

87
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:02,649
But now I'm gonna
kill you all!

88
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:05,985
Don't forget your
jacket, sweetie.

89
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:12,025
Get out of
there, you!

90
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:13,509
Never!

91
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,413
Mmm. Butter.

92
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:28,172
Round and round.

93
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:29,807
Round and round.

94
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:33,561
Freedom!

95
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:36,931
Let's get out of
here! Come on!

96
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:43,120
Apes. Deep down,
we're all savage apes.

97
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:45,055
Leave your body, Homer.

98
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:49,693
What the hell was that?

99
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:53,764
You've been through
a traumatic experience.

100
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:56,300
Are you sure you want
to go to work today?

101
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:57,902
Well, I've taken
eight months off.

102
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:00,838
It's time to get
back on the horse.

103
00:06:06,044 --> 00:06:08,279
Ho, ho, ho.

104
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:10,748
Ho, ho, ho.

105
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:13,901
Hey, neighbor, your welcome
mat's looking a little dusty.

106
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:16,086
Mind if I come over
and sweeten your greetin'.

107
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:17,721
Sweeten your greetin'!

108
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:19,523
Sweeten your greetin'.

109
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,392
Three Neds are better than one!

110
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:31,318
I hate to be a nag,
but this is my real head.

111
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:40,394
I guess, despite all
our so-called civilization,

112
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,529
anarchy lurks
around every corner,

113
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:44,632
like a racially-diverse
street gang

114
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,667
on a network cop show.

115
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:50,871
My friend, you just experienced
W.R.O.L. firsthand.

116
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:52,673
Hey, hey, read the sign, pal,
no acronyms.

117
00:06:52,707 --> 00:06:53,974
You see?

118
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:56,176
And that goes
for the rest of youse, too!

119
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:57,378
Okay, okay.

120
00:06:57,412 --> 00:06:59,980
Hey, in this bar,
we say "Old Kinderhook!"

121
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:01,882
What's W.R.O.L.?

122
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,817
It means "Without
the Rule of Law."

123
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:07,287
Anarchy. The end
of civilization.

124
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:09,823
Coming soon
to an America near you.

125
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:11,425
America can't collapse!

126
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,861
We're as powerful
as ancient Rome!

127
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:16,497
Ah, take a
look at this.

128
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:17,881
<i>The modern world--</i>

129
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,351
<i>an inexorable march</i>
<i>of progress.</i>

130
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:21,518
Sweet.

131
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:22,686
<i>Or is it?</i>

132
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:25,456
We're slaves to the system.

133
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,925
Close the supermarket,
and we starve.

134
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,527
Cut off the tap,
we drink our cat's blood.

135
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:42,489
<i>Who will survive</i>
<i>in this new world?</i>

136
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:46,393
<i>The man who is prepared.</i>

137
00:07:57,238 --> 00:07:58,572
Oh, my God!

138
00:07:58,606 --> 00:08:00,407
This unsourced,
undated video

139
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:02,242
has convinced me
beyond any doubt!

140
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:06,180
And I'm the guy you want to know
when the stuff hits the fan.

141
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:08,282
Hey, man, no need
to almost swear.

142
00:08:08,316 --> 00:08:10,317
Come with me.

143
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,886
Well, Homer's gone.

144
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:16,090
Let's all go into our suspended
state till he gets back.

145
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,799
Homer, meet
the Springfield Preppers.

146
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:28,402
Preppies? Oh, I hate you guys!

147
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:31,338
Always partying on deck
with your Docksiders

148
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:34,074
while us townies
are scrubbing the bilge!

149
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:35,743
Not preppies. Preppers.

150
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:38,078
But I like your hatred.

151
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:39,546
It's based on nothing.

152
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:41,048
That's super.

153
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:44,718
Now, Homer, what would you do
in the case of an E.M.P.?

154
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,889
Electromagnetic pulse.

155
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,525
A burst of radiation

156
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,894
that knocks out every electrical
system in the country.

157
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:55,229
I'd slash my wrists.

158
00:08:55,263 --> 00:08:57,197
But how,
without my electric knife?!

159
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:59,716
There is an alternative
to suicide.

160
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:01,618
Mm. I can't conceive of any.

161
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:04,988
We can teach you the skills
you need to survive any crisis.

162
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,923
Ooh.

163
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:07,157
All we ask is

164
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:08,926
that you keep
your prepping secret.

165
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,829
We won't have room
for all the unprepared.

166
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:15,299
Don't worry. I'm very good
at keeping secrets.

167
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,301
"Impending doom."

168
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:18,469
What you reading, Dad?

169
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:21,004
Honey, everything's fine.

170
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,773
There's nothing to worry about.

171
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:24,374
When grown-ups say that,

172
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:26,643
it means there <i>is</i> something
to worry about.

173
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:28,378
Just go play your saxophone.

174
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,847
While you can.

175
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:30,914
What does that mean?

176
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:33,016
Secrets? I have no secrets!

177
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,885
Just enjoy this golden time

178
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,688
you will soon cling desperately
to the memory of.

179
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:40,023
Smell some bread!

180
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:43,026
When things go south,

181
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:47,030
the <i>sheeple</i> will clean out
every supermarket in town.

182
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:48,432
Typical sheeple.

183
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:52,152
Uh... are you eating my grain?

184
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:53,954
Maybe.

185
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:56,523
That was a five-pound bag!

186
00:09:56,558 --> 00:09:58,225
Yeah, but I'll go
home, weigh myself,

187
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:00,160
and I'll have
gained <i>six</i> pounds.

188
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:01,361
What's that about?

189
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:03,163
♪ Prep, prep, prep.

190
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,633
Hey, Dad, are we
going camping?

191
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:09,536
I guess an open garage
isn't the best hiding place.

192
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:11,538
What's up? Going
crazy again?

193
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:13,240
I wish.

194
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:15,509
Son, the best way
to explain this is

195
00:10:15,543 --> 00:10:18,645
to show you
some age-inappropriate movies.

196
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:27,154
So, what have you
learned so far

197
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:30,090
from our post-apocalyptic
movie marathon?

198
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:33,327
Guys who call themselves
Preacher or Deacon are very bad.

199
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:35,929
Water is money,
unless gasoline is money.

200
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:38,131
And even though lots of things
are razor-sharp,

201
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,366
no one ever shaves.

202
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,668
Hollywood has
taught you well, my son.

203
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:44,371
Now let's push play.

204
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:49,259
Now the Ice Bishop
of Beverly Hills

205
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:53,197
will teach you
the true meaning of cold!

206
00:10:57,252 --> 00:11:00,020
I have come from a place
where the land is warm,

207
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:04,157
and the only ice is made
by machines called...

208
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,627
fridge-ra-torrs.

209
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:10,764
Fridge-ra-torrs!
Fridge-ra-torrs!

210
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:12,432
Fridge-ra-torrs!

211
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:14,301
Aren't they just
saying "refrigerator"?

212
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:17,804
Do not question
the wisdom of Tom Skerritt.

213
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,140
Here it is, Homer.

214
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:22,542
The Springfield Preppers'
top secret Bug-Out Retreat.

215
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:24,695
Wow! Your <i>end</i>
of the world

216
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:27,197
is better than my
<i>during</i> the world.

217
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:29,349
Homer, we all know
America's collapse

218
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:31,184
is about three months away.

219
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:33,186
Six weeks
at most.

220
00:11:33,221 --> 00:11:34,688
There's always one alarmist.

221
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,623
Anyway, when
the Four Horsemen ride,

222
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:39,426
we want you and your collaterals
right here with us.

223
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,494
Aw.

224
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:42,696
Uh, listen, I've got to know--

225
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,564
you're not just being nice to me

226
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:47,434
because in a pinch you could
make candles from my fat?

227
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:48,802
Well, that is a big part of it.

228
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:50,971
It's okay.
I know what I am.

229
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:54,441
Hmm?

230
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:56,843
I can't find
all our cereal crackers,

231
00:11:56,878 --> 00:11:59,446
juice boxes,
the butter brush...

232
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,450
Um... a lot of that stuff
must've got lost in the move.

233
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:05,218
What move?
We haven't moved.

234
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:06,887
What's going on?

235
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:10,724
Oh! I want to tell you, but I
promised to keep it a secret.

236
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:13,627
You can't have secrets
from your wife!

237
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:16,830
It's <i>very</i> late in the marriage
to tell me that.

238
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:20,033
I've hidden all our supplies
behind a fake wall.

239
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:22,736
I thought the basement
looked cleaner.

240
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,871
See? These are
our bug-out bags.

241
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:27,307
In here is everything
we need to survive.

242
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:28,642
Survive what?

243
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:31,111
The looming kablooey.

244
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:33,981
It's reassuring to see
you're aware of the future,

245
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:37,117
but this is all a little...
creepy.

246
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:38,118
Creepy?!

247
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:40,087
Marge, the apocalypse is coming.

248
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:43,123
Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never,
but it's coming.

249
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:45,125
And soon.

250
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,110
I'm going to bed.

251
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,699
There's no handle
on this side!

252
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:56,486
The one thing
I couldn't prepare for.

253
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:01,586
Oh, these here
are my snack chips.

254
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:04,040
Your cheese puffs.
Those are doodles.

255
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:06,395
I will eat anything orange
except an orange.

256
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,967
And that's
how you deliver a baby calf

257
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,803
with a bathroom plunger. Mm-hmm.

258
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:22,845
An E.M.P.?!

259
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,697
You know what
that means!

260
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:27,049
Hand scissors.

261
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:40,579
Oh.

262
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:06,255
All electronics in Springfield
have been disabled.

263
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:08,924
Even the musical greeting cards.

264
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,694
This is it.
Bug-out time.

265
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:16,115
Everyone but
us is doomed.

266
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:18,233
I am so jazzed.

267
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:21,937
Mr. Mayor, what's your
administration doing

268
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:23,772
to ensure
there's no panic?

269
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,158
I don't know. What is
<i>your</i> administration doing?

270
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:27,593
There you have it.

271
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:29,678
A town without rules,
without leadership,

272
00:14:29,712 --> 00:14:31,146
without television.

273
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:33,916
This is Kent Brockman,
talking to himself.

274
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,286
Marge, this is
it, TEOTWAWKI!

275
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,955
"The end of the world
as we know it"?

276
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:41,123
Uh-huh. Where's
the kids?

277
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:42,958
Lisa and Maggie
are downstairs,

278
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:45,227
and Bart's in his room
with Milhouse.

279
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:46,995
Boy, get in the car,

280
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,064
and say good-bye
to your best friend forever.

281
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,432
Bye forever, Milhouse.

282
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,633
See you, Bart.

283
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:54,636
Mmm.

284
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:56,104
This is my daughter.

285
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:59,308
She brings the gift of
music to the new world.

286
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:02,411
Is that sax alto or baritone?
Baritone.

287
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:05,314
This is gonna be
a <i>long</i> apocalypse.

288
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:06,748
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

289
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:08,250
<i>Ay, caramba</i> indeed.

290
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:09,451
Dad, how are we
supposed to spend

291
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:10,686
the rest of
our lives here?

292
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,020
We're already bored.

293
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:14,156
Here's something
to pass the endless time.

294
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,557
Write down which celebrities

295
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:17,726
were rumored to be gay
for future generations.

296
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,328
Yes, sir.

297
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,697
Society will not

298
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:23,932
have to start
from square one.

299
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,605
Homie, I never thought
we'd turn our backs

300
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:35,577
Marge, when I started prepping
for the end of the world,

301
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:37,346
everyone laughed at me.

302
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,714
No one was laughing.

303
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:40,282
You kept it a secret!

304
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:41,683
Well, just because
I imagined it,

305
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:43,085
doesn't make it
any less true.

306
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:45,988
And now all those
people are on their own.

307
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:48,357
How can you call yourself
a Christian?

308
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:51,693
If Jesus had a gun,
he'd be alive today.

309
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:53,312
Homer Simpson!

310
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:55,531
When I fell in love
with you,

311
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:59,051
it was because of your big heart
and your good looks.

312
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:02,187
But some day, those good looks
are gonna fade.

313
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:03,655
What?!

314
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:06,325
Soon we'll be approached

315
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:08,827
by people
who haven't prepared.

316
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:10,796
Now, do not look at their faces.

317
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,998
That can trigger feelings
and emotions,

318
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:15,651
which have no place

319
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:19,488
in Civilization 2.0:
Rise of the Weirdos.

320
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:21,490
I may have solved that problem.

321
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:23,225
This rifle scope I modified

322
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:27,229
makes any human face
look dangerous and threatening.

323
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,334
Boom.

324
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:34,069
Why do we have
to shoot them at all?

325
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:36,204
Are you that good with a knife?

326
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:39,675
No! I want to help the people
who didn't prepare.

327
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:42,010
Boom. Boom.

328
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:44,012
Boom.
What'd you shoot me for?

329
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:46,582
You were thinking I'd gone mad
with power, weren't you?!

330
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:48,150
I wasn't, but I am now.

331
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:49,418
Boom-boom-
boom-boom-boom.

332
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,030
Oh, God, now what?

333
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:03,866
Every time you wake us up early
in the morning,

334
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:06,869
it's either church or we have
to change our identities.

335
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:09,539
Don't be silly,
Mary Ellen.

336
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:11,074
Now we're going
to leave this place.

337
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,225
I'm sorry, Bart.

338
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,193
I know you've made
a bug-out camp girlfriend.

339
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:15,468
I've got to be honest with you.

340
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:17,864
It was just a bag of rice
I drew a face on.

341
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:18,965
White ricer brown?

342
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:19,816
I never noticed.

343
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,883
Good boy.

344
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:22,819
So we'll take these supplies

345
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:25,121
back to Springfield where
they're needed most.

346
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:28,057
You're a good man,
Homer Simpson.

347
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:34,547
You said you cut the wires
to the alarm.

348
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:36,883
Hmm, I cut the wires
to something.

349
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:49,488
Okay everybody,
keep your eyes peeled

350
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:53,465
for an unlit mile post marked
"23" or "36" or something.

351
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:54,800
If we miss it, we're dead.

352
00:17:54,818 --> 00:17:56,902
Dad, there are lights
following us.

353
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:59,572
How can that be?
I took every last can of gas.

354
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,448
Now, everyone relax and pretend
we're about to be hit

355
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:10,850
by a soft brick wall.

356
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,819
Out of our way, corn!

357
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:15,371
The starving people
of Springfield

358
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:17,873
are desperately in need
of our delivery of canned corn,

359
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:21,427
corn flakes
and flash frozen corn niblets!

360
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:33,239
I'm proud of you.

361
00:18:33,273 --> 00:18:36,675
Society may have crumbled,
but our decency hasn't.

362
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,578
Now to save these sorry souls
from a life of anarchy,

363
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:43,182
starvation and having
sex for procreation.

364
00:18:44,217 --> 00:18:46,018
Huh?

365
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,858
Oh, everything's normal.

366
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:55,294
The world didn't end!

367
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:58,631
Dad, you said people would be
drinking each other's blood.

368
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:02,468
You got to watch a VHS
copy of <i>Red Dawn</i> 13 times!

369
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:04,470
Stop complaining!

370
00:19:04,504 --> 00:19:06,038
What happened
with the E.M.P.?

371
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:08,207
Only Springfield
lost power,

372
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:11,143
you see, and after a few
days, it came back.

373
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:13,696
Maybe a little bit brighter.

374
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,898
And the spirit of neighborly
cooperation broke out

375
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:18,868
as if all the weird,
angry people had left.

376
00:19:18,902 --> 00:19:20,603
Then society
didn't crumble?

377
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,872
The zoo animals
weren't eaten?

378
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:24,707
No-- well, a couple.

379
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:28,878
This non-disaster
is a catastrophe!

380
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:32,014
Are you really so disappointed
the world didn't end,

381
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:34,150
just so you could
be proven right?

382
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:35,284
No, no.

383
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:37,286
It's just that,
in the new world,

384
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,789
I would have been a big shot.

385
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:41,090
Well, not for long.

386
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:42,758
Me and the others
were planning

387
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:45,127
to overthrow you
and seal you in a cave.

388
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:47,530
Yeah, but what
you didn't know

389
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:50,065
was I was gonna poison
all your drinking water.

390
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,335
Which is why I'm only drinking
my own urine.

391
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:58,390
Guys, can't you see
that even an imperfect society

392
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:01,427
is better than the savagery
of creating a new one?

393
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:03,762
I for one am glad we're stuck
with civilization,

394
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:08,033
and I think we will be
for a long, long time.

395
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:19,119
I'm hungry.

396
00:20:19,144 --> 00:20:21,112
Look, you can have
potato chips now,

397
00:20:21,113 --> 00:20:23,200
or if you wait ten
minutes, you can have

398
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,852
all the brains
you can eat.

399
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:26,100
I want both.

400

401
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:15,206
Shh!
