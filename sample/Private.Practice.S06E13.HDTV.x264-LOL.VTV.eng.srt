1
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:04,443
Okay.
I want to say something wise.

2
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:07,912
I want to have some wisdom.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,115
I mean...

4
00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:11,450
I've been here before.

5
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:14,419
I've done this already.

6
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:15,854
The first time you get married--

7
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:20,191
I mean, I had this very large
fairy tale wedding.

8
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:22,426
You know, with the music
and the flowers

9
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:24,995
and the dress.

10
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:29,600
I was young and marrying the guy
that everyone said was

11
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:31,802
the perfect man.

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,038
And he was.

13
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:37,874
Derek was perfect.

14
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:40,109
Turns out, he just...

15
00:00:40,178 --> 00:00:42,045
wasn't perfect for me.

16
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:44,414
And even though I made
my fair share of mistakes,

17
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:46,616
I definitely...

18
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:48,818
was not innocent.

19
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:54,056
I was really angry at him
for messing up my fairy tale.

20
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:56,091
And...

21
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,826
for taking my 30s

22
00:00:57,894 --> 00:01:00,462
and for being happy
with someone else

23
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,833
and for making me feel
like a failure.

24
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,636
And it took me
a really long time

25
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:11,406
to get over that.

26
00:01:11,473 --> 00:01:14,842
And I made a lot of mistakes

27
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,777
with a lot of men,

28
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:19,013
trying to get over that.

29
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:23,617
But...

30
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:28,388
then slowly, over time,

31
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:31,858
everything changes,

32
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,827
and you're no longer
this young thing

33
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:37,130
and you don't believe
in fairy tales

34
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:41,601
and "perfect" isn't
in your vocabulary.

35
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:49,508
And then suddenly,

36
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:53,512
here is this man.

37
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,580

00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,723
(Amelia) - Addison.
- I can't do it. I can't.

40
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,023
People are waiting.
Jake is waiting.

41
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:08,192
I just said that I can't do it,
not like this.

42
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,628
Okay. All right. Hey.

43
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:11,662
Addison, Addison,
stop pacing, okay? Look at me.

44
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,196

46
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:16,734
You can do this.
You wanna do this.

47
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,669
You love Jake
and you are ready.

48
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:20,437
And the preacher guy
is gonna leave

49
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:21,905
- because we only paid him for two hours.
(Violet) - Amelia.

50
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:23,507
Problem solved!

51
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:25,208
- I'm here.
(Violet) - Oh! (Laughing)

52
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:26,443
I'm so sorry. Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

53
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:27,977
The plane was late

54
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:31,013
and was circling
for some ridiculous reason.

55
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:32,682
- And I was freaking out.
I was--I was trying to-- - Aw!

56
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,517
- I was trying to call you on the...
- Nai!

Cell phone,

58
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,587
and I thought the stewardess
was gonna freak out.

59
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:39,188
I thought the Air Marshall was
gonna take me down. (Squeals)

60
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:40,890
It was a mess, but I'm here.
I'm here.

Oh, you look beautiful.

At least, I think it's a book.

179
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,240
Yeah, it's a book.
I'm pretty sure.

180
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:09,742
What's it about?

181
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,710
I don't wanna
talk about it yet. (Laughs)

182
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:13,679
Is it about me?
<i>Can</i> it be about me?

183
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:14,914
"The Chronicles Of Coop"?
"The Coop Chronicles"?

184
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,916
Anybody seen Addison or Jake?

185
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:19,250
Photographer wants
to do photos.

186
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:21,052
- Where are they?
- Let's see.

187
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,354
We're at a hotel, and there are
rooms downstairs.

188
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:25,156
It's their wedding night,
Amelia.

189
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:26,223
Maybe they wanted
to get to the honeymoon

190
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,525
a little bit early.

191
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:29,193
Should I send the photographer
down there

192
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,528
to get photos of <i>that?</i>

193
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:32,429
- Yes.
- Yes.

194
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:39,169
(Kissing)

195
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:42,105
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

196
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:43,874
(Click) Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

197
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:45,976
Okay. Ahem. We should stop.
We should stop. We should stop.

198
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:47,277
Right?

199
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:49,845
We should stop.
(Breathes deeply)

200
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:52,514
(Clatter, click)

201
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:01,526
(Woman) Last Sunday, I woke up
and I had a lot of energy,

202
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:02,961
so I went for a run.

203
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:04,663
Then I went home
and did some baking.

204
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,598
There's this really good

205
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,834
double chocolate
peanut butter chip brownie thing

206
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,334
that I've been working on.

207
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:11,802
It's... crazy.

208
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,304
And, um, then...

209
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:16,440
I watched a movie,

210
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:19,844
did some laundry, and, uh...

211
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:23,146
it wasn't until
I went to bed that

212
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:25,349
I realized it was the day.

213
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,617
The 6-year anniversary.

214
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:30,887
How'd that make you feel?

215
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:34,023
Um, a little bit guilty,

216
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:37,861
'cause it doesn't feel right
that I should just forget them.

217
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:40,797
Then I felt relieved.

218
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:44,500
I was just relieved.
I'm relieved.

219
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,769
Tell me your truth.

220
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:49,805
My parents and boyfriend died

221
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:52,708
in a car accident
that I survived.

222
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:54,610
Say it again.

223
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:56,912
My parents and boyfriend died

224
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,413
in a car accident
that I survived.

225
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:02,650
Do you remember how long it
took you to come up with that?

226
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:04,819
How long it took you
to say it out loud?

227
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:06,821
They died. I survived.

228
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:08,489
You survived.

229
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,861
Holly, our time is up, but I...

230
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,330
wanna tell you something
that's very good.

231
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:18,665
Okay.

232
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,133
I think we're done here.

233
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,135
What?

234
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:25,138
Well, you've been coming
to see me for five years,

235
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:27,473
sometimes more than
once a week.

236
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,308
Now you're off your meds.

237
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:31,309
You moved out
of your aunt's house.

238
00:09:31,377 --> 00:09:33,045
You have an apartment
and a job now.

239
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:34,747
You're applying
to cooking schools.

240
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:37,215
Yeah, but, um,
does that mean that I--

241
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:40,352
Holly, last month, you visited
your boyfriend's parents.

242
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,588
You were able
to sit and talk with them

243
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:44,590
for the first time
since he died.

244
00:09:44,658 --> 00:09:46,758
That's the final step
on your goal list.

245
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:49,994
And listening to you now, I...

246
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:52,430
I think it's time.

247
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:54,933
I think you're ready
to graduate.

248
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,501
I think you can do this
on your own.

249
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:00,972
Great.

250
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,673
Great.

251
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:05,676
(Bell dings)

252
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:07,044
Hey! (Chuckles)

253
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:08,411
Right on time as usual, huh?

254
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,981
Mm, punctuality's important...

255
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,616
- Especially now.
- Especially now. (Laughs)

256
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:13,784
I knew you were gonna
make a joke,

257
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:15,218
but I-I wanted
to beat you to it.

258
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:16,753
(Laughs)

259
00:10:16,821 --> 00:10:18,788
Hey. Miranda!

260
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:20,790
- Miranda.
- Roll her on her side.

261
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:22,191
(Charlotte) I got her airway.

262
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:23,693
Someone call the paramedics.
I need 10 of lorazepam.

263
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:26,596
She hasn't seized before.

264
00:10:26,663 --> 00:10:28,564
We're gonna take care of her,
Sheldon.

265
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:34,368
You okay?

266
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:38,372
I knew it was stage IV.
It was always stage IV.

267
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,776
So this was inevitable, but...

268
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:45,246
knowing it isn't the same
as... <i>knowing</i> it.

269
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:50,250
She's really dying now.

270
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:52,252
(Baby crying)
(Cooper) It's open.

271
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,687
Hey.

272
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:57,091
I come bearing shrimp chow fun
and fortune cookies.

273
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,458
(Door closes)

274
00:10:58,526 --> 00:10:59,827
(Violet) Wow.

275
00:10:59,894 --> 00:11:01,095
You have no idea, okay?

276
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,663
I have to feed
all three of 'em.

277
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:04,397
By the time I get
to the last one,

278
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:05,898
the first one is hungry
and crying again,

279
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,500
and they've started--

280
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:08,901
they've started this crazy
synchronized pooping.

281
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,203
No, no. I swear to God.
I think they gave a signal.

282
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,872
- One of them poops...
- Cooper...

283
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,674
- and then the other one poops...
- I feel like you need to...

284
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,877
- and the other one poops.
- sit down and take a breath, okay?

285
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,346
(Chuckles)

286
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,380
They're evil
and they're working together,

287
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,582
and... (Whispers) I think Caroline's
the ringleader. (Chuckles)

288
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,053
I hate them, Violet.

289
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,254
You don't hate them.

290
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,856
No, I love them.
They're my kids.

291
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,524
But how do people do this?
I mean, for years

292
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,726
I've been yammering on
to exhausted parents

293
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,194
about what a miracle time
this is.

294
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,728
I'm surprised
no one's decked me.

295
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:39,496
It <i>is</i> a miracle.

296
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:40,898
- You've been waitin' your
whole life for this. - I know.

297
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,800
And I told Charlotte I would
stay at home and raise them,

298
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,268
but now...

299
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:47,304
But I can't handle it
and I'm about to snap, Violet.

300
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,774
So what do I do?
What am I supposed to do?

301
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:52,910
You know what to do.

302
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,443
You're gonna tell me
to talk to Charlotte.

303
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:56,046
(Whispers) Your father's
finally learning.

304
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:57,747
(Gasps)

305
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:59,149
(Bell dings)

306
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:03,053
You didn't have to take a cab.

307
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,055
Oh, you were working.
You know...

308
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:06,422
Well, I would've
come and gotten you

309
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,657
and take the day off,
had I known you were coming.

310
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:08,925
This is very momentous.

311
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:10,125
You haven't visited
in two years,

312
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:11,526
and now I got you twice
in three months?

313
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:13,228
Well, I-I have to be
in San Francisco tomorrow

314
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:14,830
and I thought, you know,
why not...

315
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:15,964
stop off and have
a little detour?

316
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:17,265
- Well, good!
- So... yeah.

317
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,701
Come on. Now listen.
Do you want to do a late lunch

318
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:20,035
or can you wait till dinner?

319
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:21,837
'Cause Jake makes a steak
so rare

320
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,972
you can still talk to the cow.

321
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:27,975
Oh, hey. You okay?

322
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:29,343
Yeah.

323
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:31,212
Uh, yeah. It's...
don't mention food.

324
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,646
Are you queasy?

325
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:33,881
Yeah. It's probably...
the-- the flight.

326
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:35,583
It was really bumpy, you know?

327
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,686
Yeah? I was gonna say. You're
not pregnant, are you? (Laughs)

328
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:42,055
- Oh, my...
- What?

329
00:12:42,123 --> 00:12:43,423
Is that...

330
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,657
<i>Are</i> you?

331
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,193
(Lowered voice) Yes.

332
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:50,097
- Oh! (Laughs)
- I'm still trying to get used to the idea,

333
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:51,732
so please don't tell anybody.

334
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,367
But Fife must be thrilled,
right?

335
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,636
(Chuckles nervously) Yeah.

336
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:58,904
(Laughs) Oh, Nai! A baby!

337
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:00,505
- Yeah.
- Oh! Congratulations.

338
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:03,308
(Laughing)

339
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:11,859
Okay, Nai, everything
looks great. Heartbeat's strong.

340
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:14,862
Look, you can see it.

341
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,063
Okay.

342
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,999
You gotta start talking.

343
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,468
Something--
something's wrong.

344
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,269
What? No, I'm happy.

345
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:26,405
I'm-- I am. I'm really happy
about the... the baby.

346
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,073
It's...

347
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,709
it's-- you know,
it's just that, uh,

348
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:30,910
Fife and I aren't--
aren't doing well.

349
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,745
We're not...
(Instrument clatters)

350
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,647
It's kind of not working.

351
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:36,348
I thought everything was good.
You didn't say anything.

352
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,449
Well, you were getting married.

353
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:39,018
You know, it's...

354
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:42,888
it's that Fife works a lot,
and he-- and he travels a lot.

355
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,689
He's a good guy. He is.

356
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,657
He's-- he's-- he's just
a researcher first.

357
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,025
You know, he's married
to his work.

358
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:49,760
Well, are you two
in counseling?

359
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,595
Addie, Fife doesn't
live with me anymore.

360
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:54,798
We're done.

361
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:56,333
Oh, I-I...

362
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:57,568
I just thought with the baby...

363
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,436
Well, you know,
things happen. Huh?

364
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:00,771
(Chuckles) Lucky me.

365
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,039
Every relationship's wrong

366
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:03,372
unless it's the right one,
right?

367
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,043
Um..

368
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:09,111
What about, uh, you and Sam?

369
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:11,080
What?

370
00:14:11,114 --> 00:14:15,151
Well, we never talked about it.
Why did you guys break up?

371
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:16,452
Oh... (Sighs)

372
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,820
I, um...

373
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:20,722
W-well, Sam--
he didn't want kids,

374
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,323
you know, which was sad
and frustrating.

375
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:24,660
But in the end, it was great
because I have Jake,

376
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:27,763
and Jake loves kids.
He loves Henry.

377
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,466
So it all turned out
the way it was supposed to.

378
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:32,834
Yeah.

379
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:35,269
Hey, I am here for you,
all right?

380
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:36,904
(Exhales) No matter what.

381
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:38,973
- We'll figure this out.
- Okay. Yeah.

382
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:45,680
What happened?

383
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:48,482
Hey. You're okay. All right.

384
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,017
Miranda, you had a seizure.

385
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:52,986
Oh. That's new.

386
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:54,588
Amelia had you admitted.

387
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:56,289
She says you need
to be monitored.

388
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:57,857
Mm. I need to be
on a beach somewhere,

389
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:00,126
drinking something
with an umbrella in it.

390
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:01,561
The scans show that y--

391
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:04,664
The scans show that
I'm dying of cancer. Yep.

392
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:06,032
(Exhales deeply)

393
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,266
I need you to stay for
observation, at least overnight.

394
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:10,435
Oh, I don't really think
that's necessary.

395
00:15:10,503 --> 00:15:12,237
Miranda.

396
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:13,238
Please.

397
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:17,810
Okay, I'll stay one night.

398
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:19,511
Good.

399
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:21,880
Can I get you anything?

400
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:23,748
A cure for cancer
would be nice.

401
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:33,224
No, you-- you are not
dropping out of school.

402
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,459
I'm just taking a semester off.

403
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:36,995
Okay. Can we-- can we talk
about this for a minute?

404
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,662
Just...

405
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,463
why?

406
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:42,432
I wanna go to Europe.
Rome.

407
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,134
Okay, I'll send you there
this summer.

408
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:45,401
It'll be my treat.

409
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:47,004
Or-- or what about
studying abroad?

410
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:51,041
Eli is teaching there
next semester,

411
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:52,342
and he asked me to come.

412
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,576
I'm going.

413
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:55,410
You're making a mistake.

414
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:57,212
I love him.

415
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,781
Another mistake.

416
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:00,449
I don't need your permission.
I just wanted you to know.

417
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:02,384
Look, Angela...

418
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:09,324
Oh, hi. I'm sorry.

419
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:11,026
I just walked past
your receptionist.

420
00:16:11,093 --> 00:16:12,593
I'm interrupting you.

421
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:13,995
You're in the middle
of a million things, I'm sure.

422
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:17,132
- I'm really--
- Holly, Holly, tell me what's wrong.

423
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,566
I, um, I-I got in.

424
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:22,236
I got accepted
to Le Cordon Bleu in Paris.

425
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:23,538
I got into

426
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:25,373
the best cooking school
in the world.

427
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,107
Holly! Congratulations!

428
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:31,145
No, it's no congratulations.
I can't go. It's in Paris.

429
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:33,513
This is what you wanted.
This is your dream.

430
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:35,849
It's a big change,
it is out of your comfort zone,

431
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:37,217
but you can handle it.

432
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:38,585
What if something goes wrong?

433
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:40,420
We've talked about
you being ready.

434
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:42,755
Uh, well, there's
a 9-hour time difference

435
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,891
between there and here.

436
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,593
And it's a whole continent
and an ocean away.

437
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:48,961
Okay, it is far, but--

438
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:51,764
No, it's an entire continent
and an ocean

439
00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:53,365
away from <i>you.</i>

440
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:55,401
Oh, Holly.

441
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:58,504
You told me that if I ever
needed you, you would be there.

442
00:16:58,572 --> 00:17:00,605
So what if something happens,

443
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:03,541
and I need you
and I'm in Paris?

444
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:06,211
It doesn't...
logically make sense.

445
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:08,513
It doesn't work.
(Inhales deeply)

446
00:17:10,683 --> 00:17:13,551
I'm not going.
I'm not leaving therapy.

447
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,119
I'm not ready.

448
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:21,792
I must say, I have missed
this kitchen.

449
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,594
This feels like home.

450
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:25,062
(Mouth full)
Aw, you should stay.

451
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,296
I'm serious.

452
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:27,898
Mmm, this is amazing.
What is this?

453
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:30,034
Kale pasta salad,
with homemade pasta.

454
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:31,701
- Wow.
- My patient Holly made it.

455
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:33,169
You have a mental patient
who makes you food?

456
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:34,303
(Chuckles) Charlotte.

457
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:36,072
I'm sorry.

458
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,275
I'm cranky and tired 'cause
Cooper's cranky and tired.

459
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:41,310
Man gets to stay home all day,
swimming in babies.

460
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:44,447
You think he'd be happy.
But no, he's moody as hell.

461
00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:45,815
My boobs are gonna explode.
I gotta go pump.

462
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,018
(Laughs) Things have certainly
changed around here.

463
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:51,720
You know, your mental patient's
very talented.

464
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:53,055
She should be a chef.

465
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:54,356
She got accepted
to the Cordon Bleu...

466
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:56,024
- Mm!
- but she's not gonna go.

467
00:17:56,092 --> 00:17:58,560
She's afraid to leave therapy.
She's afraid to leave me.

468
00:17:58,628 --> 00:18:00,929
You know, maybe I misjudged.

469
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,231
I'm gonna let her
keep coming in.

470
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,766
Oh. Hey. Hey, everybody.

471
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,033
Hi.

472
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:07,568
(Chuckles) - Hey. Yeah.
- It's Na-- Naomi.

473
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:09,470
I didn't know you were...
Are you-- What are you...

474
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:12,406
Uh, no, yeah,
I'm just coming through

475
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:13,574
- and I was visiting Addie.
- Oh.

476
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:15,709
- Yeah.
- That's great. That's great.

477
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,645
Ha! (Mutters)

478
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:19,679
Oops. Sorry.

479
00:18:19,747 --> 00:18:21,381
- Did you...
- Sorry. No, I...

480
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:24,684
(Laughs) (Laughs)

481
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:25,819
(Chairs squeaking) Sam?

482
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,720
Yeah? Nah, nah.

483
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:29,489
I'm not that thir-- thirsty.

484
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,664
(Mouth full) Girl, holy crap.
That's...

485
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:40,032
that's really good.

486
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,566
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

487
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:44,236
So good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

488
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:47,840
You're 13 weeks pregnant,
aren't you?

489
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:51,309
W-what?

490
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:53,211
Yeah, you should know. You just
did the ultrasound today.

491
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,379
I mean <i>exactly</i> 13 weeks,

492
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:57,315
because that's when
I got married.

493
00:18:57,382 --> 00:19:01,052
13 weeks ago.

494
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,220
Naomi?

495
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:03,654
(Sighs)

496
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:08,025
(Slaps leg) It just happened.

497
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:09,693
(Whispers) Oh!

498
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,328
It just happened.

499
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:12,996
I don't know-- I don't even know
<i>why</i> it happened.

500
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:15,332
We're divorced. We're--
we're good. We've got closure.

501
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:17,367
But it-- We just saw each other,
and...

502
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:19,002
(Sighs) Oh, God.
I don't know. It's Sam.

503
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,304
<i>You</i> know. It's-- it's Sam.

504
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:21,771
Okay, my brain is exploding.

505
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,105
What, and you think mine isn't?
(Speaks indistinctly)

506
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:24,707
When are you gonna tell him?

507
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:26,242
I'm not gonna
tell him anything.

508
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,844
Nai, you have to!

509
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:29,979
The baby's gonna come out
looking exactly like a tiny Sam.

510
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:31,480
He is with Stephanie.

511
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:33,149
And the reason
you two didn't work out

512
00:19:33,217 --> 00:19:35,051
is because he doesn't want any
more kids, right? (Sighs)

513
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:36,185
So why would I tell him?

514
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:38,520
Because he's Sam.

515
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:40,155
I mean, you didn't just have
a one-night stand

516
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:41,323
with some random guy.

517
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,358
You chose to sleep with Sam.

518
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:45,393
And maybe the reason why the two
of you ended up in bed together

519
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:47,896
is because...
it still means something.

520
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:49,630
No.

521
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:53,235
No. Sam-- Sam walked out
on our marriage.

522
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:54,736
He walked out. He just quit.

523
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:57,171
He-- he decided he was done.
He didn't fight for us.

524
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,673
He just blew us up. I...

525
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,244
And there's a history
with... us.

526
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:04,845
You know, I...

527
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,113
(Dish clatters)

528
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:08,115
It can't mean anything.

529
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:10,384
It can't. And I-I can't
sit around hoping that it does.

530
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:11,684
I'm sorry.

531
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,519
You are in love with him,
Naomi.

532
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,888
You know,
it's-- it's getting late,

533
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:16,055
and I have
an early flight tomorrow,

534
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:17,523
so I gotta--
I gotta go to bed.

535
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,226
- Naomi.
- Leave it alone, Addison.

536
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:26,132
(Sighs deeply)

537
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,954
I can feel you staring at me.

538
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:36,422
No, I'm not.

539
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:38,858
Look, Addison, whatever
it is you're dying to say

540
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:41,660
and think you can't say,
just say it.

541
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:47,133
Okay. Naomi slept with Sam
on our wedding night,

542
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:49,836
and now she's pregnant
with Sam's baby.

543
00:20:51,137 --> 00:20:52,503
You can't tell Sam.

544
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:54,840
I don't want to tell Sam.
Why can't I tell Sam?

545
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:57,342
Because it's none of
your business. All right?

546
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:58,777
Fine.

547
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:04,883
Ahem.

548
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:06,051
Hi.

549
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,284
When I first moved to LA,

550
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:09,386
Sam told me that
he blew apart his marriage

551
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:10,621
and he never understood why.

552
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:11,956
I still don't think
he understands why.

553
00:21:12,023 --> 00:21:13,991
But now I think
that the reason why

554
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:16,493
Sam's never been able to make it
work with another woman

555
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:19,130
is because he'll always
be in love with Naomi.

556
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:20,564
And then me,
with my cheater past,

557
00:21:20,632 --> 00:21:21,966
I just jumped in there

558
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:24,167
and started dating
my best friend's ex-husband.

559
00:21:24,235 --> 00:21:25,701
And then I hurt her,
I hurt him.

560
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,771
And you know what?
He's not happy with Stephanie.

561
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:29,072
And she left Fife.

562
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,307
And so how is it fair
that I get to be happy,

563
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:35,478
all married to you,
hot saint man?

564
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:36,813
And they're gonna be miserable

565
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:39,347
because she's got such pride,

566
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:40,615
and he's got such...

567
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:41,917
Prejudice?

568
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,385
(Groans)

569
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:44,519
You realize this isn't
a Jane Austen novel, right?

570
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:45,720
Oh, shut up.

571
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,121
You shut up. Get in here.

572
00:21:57,565 --> 00:21:58,599
Hey.

573
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:05,205
- Addison?
- Do you love Stephanie?

574
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:06,639
What?

575
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:08,875
Do you... love Stephanie?

576
00:22:08,943 --> 00:22:10,376
(Laughs)

577
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:11,878
I mean, I don't...
That's none of y--

578
00:22:11,946 --> 00:22:13,746
I don't see how that's any of
y-- of your-- uh, your business.

579
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:15,015
No, it's not.
It's really not.

580
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:18,150
But Nai...
she's my business.

581
00:22:18,218 --> 00:22:20,385
(Whispers) Oh.

582
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:21,453
(Sighs) (Sets down pencil)

583
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:23,255
Look...

584
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:25,390
Okay, what happened between
Nai and me...

585
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,559
we were confused.
It was a mistake.

586
00:22:27,627 --> 00:22:29,628
It happened once.
End of story.

587
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:30,996
Okay, I'm gonna say a thing,

588
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:33,032
and you can take it
or leave it, whatever.

589
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:34,933
Naomi and Fife
never got married.

590
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,268
They are no longer together.

591
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:39,938
And... that is all I'm gonna say.

592
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:42,573
(Pats leg) I've already
said way too much.

593
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:44,709
Okay, I'm gonna say
one more thing.

594
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:47,145
She is in love with you.
Naomi is still in love with you.

595
00:22:47,213 --> 00:22:49,980
And I am... 72% certain

596
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:53,984
that I did the right thing
in telling you this information.

597
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:02,860
Hi.

598
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:04,328
Why are you out of bed?

599
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:05,795
I'm going home.

600
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:08,030
No, you-- you haven't
been discharged.

601
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:10,699
I know. That's why I'm filling
out this fancy form

602
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:14,703
that says I'm leaving against
medical advice.

603
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:17,406
Miranda. Miranda.

604
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,244
I know how you feel
about hospitals,

605
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:23,579
but... you should stay.

606
00:23:23,646 --> 00:23:25,013
I'd be here with you.

607
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:27,549
You know, every--
every single day.

608
00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:29,618
You know if I stay here,

609
00:23:29,686 --> 00:23:31,319
they're gonna send in
oncologists

610
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:33,856
and radiation therapists
and surgeons.

611
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:37,225
And that no matter what they do,
the tumor inside my brain

612
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:40,095
is still gonna destroy
my ability to talk and walk

613
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:42,397
and go to the bathroom.

614
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,332
Before you know it,
I'm gonna be throwing up

615
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,334
and wearing diapers,

616
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:49,637
and I'm not gonna remember
your name.

617
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:51,072
I'm gonna be in so much pain,

618
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,673
they're gonna ply me
with morphine,

619
00:23:52,741 --> 00:23:55,943
which will make me numb,
and that will make me drool.

620
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:57,344
And there's so much more--

621
00:23:57,412 --> 00:24:00,480
a thousand other
horrible indignities

622
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:02,682
I just haven't thought of yet.

623
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,253
So I don't really wanna spend
my last days here.

624
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,922
Can you...

625
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,124
understand that?

626
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:12,258
Okay.

627
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,193
Okay. I'll-- I'll take you home.
I'll take care of you.

628
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:16,195
(Scoffs) No. I don't want you
to take care of me, Sheldon.

629
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:19,465
I don't you changing
my diapers.

630
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:21,600
Okay.

631
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,137
If you need to, we-- we can
get you a private nurse.

632
00:24:24,204 --> 00:24:25,438
Look, you've come
this far with me,

633
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,939
and I really appreciate that.

634
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:28,974
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

635
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:33,345
But this is the last leg
of a really long journey.

636
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:35,847
And the good part is over now
and the bad part is starting,

637
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:39,384
and I don't want you with me.
I don't want you to see this.

638
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,455
No.

639
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:46,658
I want you to walk away

640
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:48,059
and not look back.

641
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:52,029
I-I want you to go
while I can...

642
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:53,465
still remember how much...

643
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:54,666
(Kisses)

644
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:56,100
(Voice breaks) I love you.

645
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:59,670
If you care about me at all,

646
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:01,538
you will do this for me.

647
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:03,907
Please.

648
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:06,910
Just go.

649
00:25:06,978 --> 00:25:10,180
(Stomps foot) (Crying) Just
walk away, Sheldon. Just go.

650
00:25:11,983 --> 00:25:14,485
Fine, then I'll walk away.

651
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:15,718
(Sobs)

652
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,997
(Sighs)

653
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,265
(Door opens)

654
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,133
Oh, thank God. Mom's home.
(Charlotte sighs)

655
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:33,502
(Door closes)

656
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:35,871
How are my babies?

657
00:25:35,938 --> 00:25:37,205
- Shh!
- Shh!

658
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:39,240
They're asleep.
Lower you voice.

659
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:42,110
(Sighs) Lord, am I beat.

660
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:45,580
I forget how being
on, uh, your feet all day

661
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:47,248
can really take it out of ya.

662
00:25:47,316 --> 00:25:48,315
(Grunts) You barely finish up
with one patient

663
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:49,683
before another one needs ya.

664
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:51,385
(Shoes thud)

665
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:54,989
(Sighs)
We need to hire a nanny.

666
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:57,457
What? No.

667
00:25:57,526 --> 00:25:59,459
No?

668
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:00,728
The deal was you'd stay home
with the kids

669
00:26:00,795 --> 00:26:02,195
and I'd go back to work.

670
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:04,564
I'm not changing things just
'cause you had a rough day.

671
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:05,999
Ah.

672
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:08,968
Run.

673
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:14,874
You see this shirt?

674
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:17,176
I don't know
if these stains are

675
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:19,912
vomit or breast milk anymore

676
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,014
because I've been wearing it
for five days.

677
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,148
<i>Five.</i>

678
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,382
I know that to be true

679
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,717
because I haven't had a shower
in five days.

680
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:28,086
I'm pretty sure last night
I fell asleep in the closet,

681
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,221
looking for diapers.
And I don't know how

682
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,557
to have a conversation
with adults anymore unless it's

683
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:33,324
the other sleepy-deprived moms
in the park.

684
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,326
And by the way,
after I bond with them

685
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:36,961
over the psychosis that comes

686
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,396
with being your child's
primary caregiver,

687
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,865
I'll eventually have sex
with one of them

688
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,333
because they're, you know,
on the same feeding schedule.

689
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,771
Is that what you want, me having
sex with moms in the park?

690
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,006
Because that's where
this is headed.

691
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,208
We need to hire a nanny.

692
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,850
(Exhales deeply)

693
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:02,285
You wanna watch a movie?

694
00:27:02,352 --> 00:27:04,788
Uh, sure.

695
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:08,724
Or we can go to a movie.

696
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:09,992
Uh... (Sighs) whatever
you want to do.

697
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,294
(Laughs) Sam, why am I here?

698
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:16,098
We're-- we're... (Laughs)
we're hanging out.

699
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:18,734
Yet you haven't heard
a word I've said.

700
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:22,204
(Sighs)

701
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:25,073
I'm sorry. You're right.

702
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:26,441
(Inhales deeply)

703
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:28,009
Uh... (Exhales)

704
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:31,079
I haven't heard a word
you've said because, uh...

705
00:27:34,317 --> 00:27:35,683
I'm trying to figure out

706
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:38,886
how I'm gonna say
what I need to say to you.

707
00:27:38,954 --> 00:27:41,722
Then just say it.
Whatever it is, just say it.

708
00:27:43,658 --> 00:27:47,094
Okay. Well, when we...

709
00:27:47,162 --> 00:27:51,632
The first time
we got together, uh...

710
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:54,768
you broke up with me.
You-- you said I was a mess.

711
00:27:54,836 --> 00:27:57,670
And, uh, I didn't see it.

712
00:27:57,738 --> 00:27:59,639
Well, I guess you don't
see things until...

713
00:27:59,706 --> 00:28:02,142
(Sighs)
you're ready to see them.

714
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:04,544
But you said I was a mess,

715
00:28:04,612 --> 00:28:06,146
and you were right.

716
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:08,681
- But now I--
- Okay, stop.

717
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:10,583
Just, um...

718
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:11,751
just stop.

719
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:14,353
(Sighs)

720
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,720
Okay. (Sighs)

721
00:28:15,788 --> 00:28:17,856
(Chuckles)

722
00:28:17,923 --> 00:28:19,324
I'm gonna go now

723
00:28:19,392 --> 00:28:22,594
because I do not want you to
see me cry.

724
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,031
(Sighs)

725
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:27,633
I'm so sorry, Stephanie.
I don't...

726
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,367
- I'm sorry.
(Voice breaking) - Sam, you're a good guy,

727
00:28:29,434 --> 00:28:31,835
but let me give you
a little advice.

728
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:34,004
The next time you try to get
a second chance with a woman,

729
00:28:34,072 --> 00:28:35,873
you better mean it,

730
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,075
because we're not
as tough as we look, okay?

731
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,614
And I liked her--
your ex-wife.

732
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:46,516
(Crying) When I met her,
I liked her.

733
00:28:46,584 --> 00:28:47,850
Crap.

734
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:50,887
And now I'm crying.

735
00:28:50,954 --> 00:28:52,622
And now you're gonna come over
here and comfort me,

736
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,058
and I-I hate you.

737
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:00,696
(Sobs)

738
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:06,085
So I've been working
on shellfish,

739
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,214
and um, people think
that it's easy to do,

740
00:29:09,282 --> 00:29:10,682
but people actually don't really
know what they're talking about

741
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,483
'cause it's difficult to do.

742
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,386
- There are a lot of things that
you have to know about. - Holly. Holly.

743
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,954
This is gonna be
our last session.

744
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,422
If you call the office,

745
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,291
the receptionist is not gonna
allow you to book another one.

746
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,059
- Why?
- Because you don't need me anymore.

747
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,828
You're in such a good place.

748
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,396
You're talking about recipes
and not feelings.

749
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:26,930
That doesn't mean
that I'm ready to graduate.

750
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,631
You are.

751
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:31,034
I... (Scoffs) I've been coming
here for almost six years,

752
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,837
and I'm supposed to just... stop?

753
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,906
Yeah, because you're ready
to stop.

754
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:38,008
- How do you know?
- You have to trust me.

755
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:39,575
I <i>do</i> trust you.

756
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:41,744
That's why I'm saying
I have to stay here with you.

757
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,212
Okay, why did you get
that acceptance letter

758
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,413
from Le Cordon Bleu?

759
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,481
What?

760
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:48,684
I applied and I got in.

761
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:51,086
Right. You applied.

762
00:29:51,154 --> 00:29:53,555
Cooking school is not something
that just happened to you.

763
00:29:53,623 --> 00:29:56,892
It's not an accident taking
people away in your life.

764
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,360
You chose it.

765
00:29:58,428 --> 00:30:00,428
You <i>want</i> to go.

766
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:03,231
And I'm afraid that you being
able to come back here,

767
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:04,933
even though we both know that
you don't need it anymore,

768
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,868
is holding you back.

769
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,407
(Sighs)

770
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,110
I'm scared.

771
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:19,046
I know you are.

772
00:30:19,113 --> 00:30:20,513
New things are scary.

773
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:23,350
Anything worth having is scary.

774
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,052
What if I don't like it?

775
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,686
Well, you'll only know
if you try.

776
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:31,757
So I'm just some bird that
you're kicking out of the nest?

777
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:36,495
You're like some bird.

778
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:39,065
And, Holly,

779
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:41,267
you're ready to fly.

780
00:30:46,206 --> 00:30:47,572
Hey, guys.

781
00:30:50,943 --> 00:30:52,043
What's wrong?

782
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,444
(Pours coffee)

783
00:30:53,512 --> 00:30:54,913
Uh, nothin'.

784
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:56,514
I'm good.

785
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:58,183
Hey, Sheldon, you got anything
in your shrink playbook

786
00:30:58,251 --> 00:30:59,985
to help me convince Angela

787
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:02,453
that dropping out of college
and moving to Rome

788
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:05,722
with a guy 30 years older
than she is, is a bad idea?

789
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,892
There really aren't any tricks
to convincing someone

790
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,160
that they're not in love.

791
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:12,329
It's a remarkable emotion,

792
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:15,266
impervious to logic and...

793
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,368
turning the most measured people
into risk-takers

794
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:20,003
willing to do anything
to maintain the feeling.

795
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,604
I mean...

796
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,374
Is there anything greater
than being in love?

797
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:26,742
And I'm not saying that you
should give her your blessing.

798
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,644
I'm-- I'm just saying
there's nothing you can do

799
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:31,814
to stop her or to...

800
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:34,817
to-- to-- to-- to make her see...

801
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,688
Sheldon?

802
00:31:40,756 --> 00:31:42,090
I'm... (Grunts)

803
00:31:42,158 --> 00:31:43,591
I'm madly in love,

804
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:46,428
and, uh...

805
00:31:46,495 --> 00:31:48,330
I quit.

806
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:49,398
I-I quit.

807
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:55,102
Did he just quit his job?

808
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,804
He's right.
I'm going for it.

809
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:58,439
Sorry. See you later.

810
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:14,955
I knew you'd be here.

811
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:17,057
I love being outside.

812
00:32:17,124 --> 00:32:19,792
It's so beautiful outside.

813
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,094
You know, I could stand here

814
00:32:21,162 --> 00:32:22,795
and make small talk about
the grass and the trees,

815
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:25,831
but I won't because
I'm too mad at you.

816
00:32:25,898 --> 00:32:28,533
I'm furious at you.

817
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:30,135
You don't get to tell me
to walk away,

818
00:32:30,203 --> 00:32:31,403
and you don't get to tell me

819
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:33,005
that this is your journey
and not mine.

820
00:32:33,073 --> 00:32:34,473
<i>I'm</i> on this road.

821
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,709
I've been on this road
for 56 years, all by myself,

822
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:39,810
and then <i>you</i> showed up
on <i>my</i> road.

823
00:32:39,878 --> 00:32:41,012
And that day
and every day since

824
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,180
have been the greatest days
of my life,

825
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:44,682
so I am <i>not</i> leaving you.

826
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:47,785
And I'm-- I'm happy to change
diapers and to wipe drool

827
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:51,189
and to hold your hand, 'cause
I want to take care of you.

828
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:53,391
I'm honored
to take care of you.

829
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:57,894
Your last days will be precious,
and I'll cherish them.

830
00:32:57,962 --> 00:32:59,929
And if you're too far gone
to remember my name,

831
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:01,999
then I'll remind you.
But you deserve to be loved,

832
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:04,501
right up until
your very last moment.

833
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:06,836
You deserve to be
surrounded by love.

834
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:09,206
You deserve you have the face
of the man who loves you

835
00:33:09,273 --> 00:33:10,840
be the last thing that you see.

836
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:13,275
And <i>I</i> deserve the chance to
love you for as long as I can

837
00:33:13,343 --> 00:33:16,312
or as hard as I can.
So I am not walking away.

838
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,048
- Sheldon-- - No, I'm not walking
away! <i>I'm</i> on this road.

839
00:33:19,116 --> 00:33:21,217
<i>We</i> are on this road together.

00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:23,519
- I'm not walking away.
- Okay.

841
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,287
- What?
- Okay.

842
00:33:25,355 --> 00:33:27,222
You're right. I'm wrong.

843
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:28,990
Oh.

(Cooper) - Or a brothel.

1053
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:22,633
