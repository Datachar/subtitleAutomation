1
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,185
Grace!

2
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,587
Homework?

3
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:22,121
Nope.

4
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,189
Campaign?

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,057
- I already did my homework, Mom.
- I know.

6
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,559
How's Dad doing?

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,628
He's good.
I don't see much of him, though.

8
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,429
It's mostly...

9
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,998
What?

10
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,000
- Nothing.
GRACE: Morning, Mom.

11
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,235
- I have to call Eli.
- Hi.

12
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,321
I don't need breakfast.

13
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:40,706
Too bad. You're getting it.
Sit down.

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,724
What's he doing?

15
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:43,853
I don't know.
I've given up on parenting.

16
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:46,428
- How'd you sleep?
- Well.

17
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:47,696
You look good.

18
00:00:47,697 --> 00:00:48,896
- I look...?
- Yeah.

19
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:51,799
Your hair--
it's-it's cool.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,134
ZACH:
Uh, Eli Gold, please.

21
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:55,403
No, no, tell him
it's important.

22
00:00:55,404 --> 00:00:57,405
For those of you
who don't know Jordan,

23
00:00:57,406 --> 00:00:59,474
he was chief of staff
to Barbara Boxer

24
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:01,208
and has worked
on three California

25
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:02,910
senatorial campaigns.

26
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:04,078
JORDAN: Hello,
print journalists.

27
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,080
How does it feel
to perpetuate a dying medium?

28
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:09,716
WOMAN: Does this mean the candidate
has lost faith in you, Eli?

29
00:01:09,717 --> 00:01:11,918
No. It means we're expanding.

30
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:13,453
JORDAN:
Let me, uh, backstop that.

31
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:15,890
There's been absolutely
no loss of confidence in Eli.

32
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:18,392
MAN: But Maddie Hayward
is gaining on you in the polls.

33
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:20,093
That's just a temporary
novelty bounce.

34
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:21,661
Yeah, Zach, is
this important?

35
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:24,107
I think so. I was checking out
the Maddie Hayward Web site,

36
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:27,533
and they accidentally left a link open
to internal political documents.

37
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:28,701
Okay...

38
00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:30,536
It's an easy thing to do,
but I got

39
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:32,305
a screen grab before they closed it.
(Beeping)

40
00:01:32,306 --> 00:01:33,639
Hold on.
That's our call waiting.

41
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,473
Oh, sure. Take your time.
That's why I'm here.

42
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:38,410
Hello? No.

43
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:39,911
Okay, hold on.

44
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:41,813
Uh, Mom, do you know an Elsbeth?

45
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:43,848
Tascioni? Is that
her on the phone?

46
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:45,517
Yeah, she wants to talk to you,
but I have Eli

47
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:47,585
- on the other line.
- Zach, give me the phone.

48
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:50,419
Sorry, Eli. I have to call you
back on my cell phone.

49
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,956
Elsbeth, hi.

50
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:53,057
Are you all right?

51
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,192
Uh, yes.

52
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:55,526
I just need your help on a case.

53
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:56,760
Okay. What's the case?

54
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:58,696
It's a contract
enforcement arbitration

55
00:01:58,697 --> 00:01:59,897
for my client, Anna.

56
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:01,465
It should only take a few hours.

57
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:03,701
We've got it covered, Zach.
Don't worry.

58
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:05,870
No, Maddie Hayward is going
after race-- racial bias.

59
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:07,438
There is no racial bias.
Don't worry.

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,371
It says right here that they

61
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:09,539
have two ASAs
working under Dad

62
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,606
who will say that he's biased

63
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:11,874
against them
because they're black.

64
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,043
It's a bluff.
They want us to chase our tails.

65
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:15,378
I don't think so, Eli.

66
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,880
When did you start talking
to me like I was a peer?

67
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,415
Sorry, Mr. Gold.

68
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,051
Okay, send me your screen grab,
and I'll look into it.

69
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:23,219
Okay, I'm
sending it now.

70
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,019
Yeah. Okay.
No, I'm going to come right in.

71
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,121
I'll see you there.

72
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,192
Nice having breakfast
with you, too.

73
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,293
(Laughing)

74
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:34,295
That joke was written
for me by my staff,

75
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:35,997
so they appreciate your laughter.
(Laughter)

76
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:39,300
But, uh, this
is no joke.

77
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:41,201
I love business.

78
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,271
I am not the type of feminist
that hates to make a dollar.

79
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:47,074
I am a feminist
that wants you to make money.

80
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:48,409
With women.

81
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,643
(Laughter)

82
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:51,512
And with
African-Americans.

83
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:53,347
And Latinos and
all minorities.

84
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:55,583
I think racial bias
is an impediment to business.

85
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:58,451
(Quietly): Where the
hell did that come from?

86
00:02:58,452 --> 00:03:00,587
(Applause)

87
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:02,589
We need to talk about debates.

88
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,190
Okay. We're talking.

89
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:06,559
- Four debates?
- Better talk to Eli.

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,927
Eli says one.

91
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,562
Well, Eli speaks for me.

92
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:11,130
Nice to see you.

93
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:13,231
Yes. Say hello to Alicia.

94
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:17,569
I will.

95
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:20,171
ELI:
What'd she say?

96
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:22,340
(Sighs)
The debates.

97
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:24,843
She wants four.
(Groans)

98
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:27,245
She may be coming
after you about race.

99
00:03:27,246 --> 00:03:28,679
Preferential hiring
and promotion

100
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,980
in the State's
Attorney's Office?

101
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,382
Uh, let it go.

102
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:33,918
Race is a scab--
you don't pick at it.

103
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,054
We think she has a couple
of ASAs who are...

104
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:39,424
- gonna go public.
- Public about what?

105
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:42,560
- And who's "we"?
- Zach.

106
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:45,395
He found an open link
on Maddie's Web site

107
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:47,363
- to some confidential memos.
- Who's Zach?

108
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:48,965
- Your son.
- Yeah.

109
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:52,268
So talk to the ASAs.

110
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,304
- See if anyone's disgruntled.
- Just let it go.

111
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:58,842
Let me think
about it.

112
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,812
Hi. Elsbeth Tascioni.

113
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,281
Elsbeth?

114
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:11,253
Alicia! In here. Hi!

115
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:12,955
(Quietly):
Oh, boy.

116
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:14,189
ELSBETH:
<i>I was trying to question</i>

117
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,291
Simon Fassel,
the defendant

118
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:17,592
in this arbitration.

119
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:19,727
He was giving a Q and A
after a speech,

120
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:20,795
and he had me arrested.

121
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:23,197
I've never been
arrested in my life.

122
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:24,432
And then I turned around.

123
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:25,633
This is nice.

124
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:26,868
What is this?

125
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:27,936
Tahari, I think.

126
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:29,938
So you want me to cover
for a case for you.

127
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,305
- Is that it?
- Yes, yes.

128
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:33,474
This defendant, Fassel,

129
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,776
is the CEO of Erobos,

130
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,111
the running shoe company.

131
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:38,279
Do you know it?

132
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,448
Well, they reneged on
an endorsement contract

133
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,350
for $5 million
with my client,

134
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:45,684
and the contract enforcement
arbitration is in two hours,

135
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,821
and I won't be out in time.

136
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:49,589
And what time
is your bond hearing today?

137
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,924
Not until 2:00, so if you
could just cover for me,

138
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,726
that would be great.
Hi, Judy.

139
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,228
Meet Alicia.

140
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,863
Hi.

141
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:58,298
WILL:
<i>This is in Skokie?</i>

142
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,832
ALICIA:
Yes, on a Friday.

143
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,767
They don't do bond hearings
on the weekend.

144
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,004
Get her a transport to downtown
in the next 20 minutes

145
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:05,737
or she won't get a hearing
until Monday.

146
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,373
So, I have to ask a favor, Will.

147
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,474
Can you handle

148
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,875
a contract arbitration
in an hour?

149
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:10,942
No, I've got a deposition.

150
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,777
Can someone else there
handle it?

151
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:13,845
It's Elsbeth Tascioni.

152
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,081
It's Elsbeth?

153
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,483
That's the lawyer you're with?

154
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,184
Yes.

155
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,019
Miss Buday?

156
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,187
Hello.

157
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:25,923
I know you were expecting your
lawyer, Elsbeth Tascioni.

158
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:27,325
I'm her friend,
Will Gardner.

159
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,427
She asked me to take
the arbitration today.

160
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:30,961
What happened?

161
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,497
She was arrested

162
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,432
for harassing Simon
Fassel, the CEO.

163
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, my gosh.
So she's not coming?

164
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,300
Just for today.

165
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:39,169
I'll ask for a continuance,
but don't worry.

166
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,338
Your endorsement
contract is ironclad.

167
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:42,839
This is just a formality.

168
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,174
Now, you won two silver medals.

169
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:45,842
They can't argue
nonperformance.

170
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:47,477
If I can't get
the continuance,

171
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:49,712
I'll handle today's evidence
and Elsbeth will take over

172
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:50,880
on Monday, okay?

173
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:52,015
You got her arrested?

174
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:54,083
Don't answer that, Simon.

175
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:55,817
I'll meet you inside.

176
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:57,186
Is this your new lawyer?

177
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:59,188
Temporarily.
I'm Will Gardner.

178
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:00,322
Morgan Croft.

179
00:06:00,723 --> 00:06:02,591
Sorry to lose Elsbeth
as an opponent.

180
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:05,861
She was very entertaining.

181
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,964
Can you beat them?

182
00:06:09,665 --> 00:06:11,100
Yes.

183
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:27,981
The Erobos team shot that
commercial last December.

184
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:29,149
- Is that correct, Anna?
- Yes.

185
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,051
- Were you ever paid for it?
- No.

186
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:32,319
It was also never shown.

187
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,420
Payment was not dependent

188
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:35,155
- on distribution, was it, Anna?
- No.

189
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:36,756
Sir, very simply,

190
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:39,460
Erobos owes my client
$5 million,

191
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:42,095
and we understand
they've overextended themselves

192
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:43,129
with endorsement contracts,

193
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,397
but there's no reason
my client...

194
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:45,531
Actually, sir, the company

195
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:47,166
has always reserved the right
to void

196
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,934
- any endorsement contract.
- Yes, with cause.

197
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:50,769
- Erobos has shown no such cause.
- That's true, sir.

198
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,472
We haven't-- until now.

199
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:53,739
The contract
may be voided

200
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,542
if the athlete is banned
from a race due to doping.

201
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:58,910
- What? - Ann Buday has been banned
from Monday's world team trials.

202
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:01,446
- I have not.
- I have here an AADL release

203
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:03,148
of their findings last night.

204
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:05,249
Anna has been accused
of using dexitetrasolone

205
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,318
and has been banned
from Monday's...

206
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,019
I have never doped.

207
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,022
My parents would kill me
before they'd let me dope.

208
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:11,824
The AADL disagrees,

209
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:13,324
and if Anna misses
her race on Monday

210
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:14,759
due to this ban,

211
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,828
her contract is voided.

212
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:20,996
You need to get me Elsbeth.

213
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,335
This was all a setup.

214
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:25,569
- No.
- Yes.

215
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,639
I can't get a bond hearing
until Monday,

216
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,223
and Anna has to appeal
the AADL decision

217
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:32,225
this weekend in order
to run on Monday.

218
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:33,593
They knew this was gonna happen.

219
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:34,527
Well, Will is gonna take

220
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:36,062
- the appeal...
- I like Will.

221
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:38,031
I-I do, too.

222
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:39,232
How is he?

223
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,500
Good. He's good.

224
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,468
I was sad when he was suspended.

225
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:43,636
I was, too.

226
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,905
He's gonna take the appeal
to the, um...

227
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:49,141
CAS--
Court of Arbitration for Sports.

228
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:51,677
Tell Will that the CAS

229
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:53,579
doesn't run
like an American court, okay?

230
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,248
It has a whole set of rules
based on Swiss law.

231
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:58,784
Okay, and I'm gonna work on
getting you transported downtown

232
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:00,052
for a weekend
bond hearing.

233
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:01,520
Good, and I'll do what?

234
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:02,521
You're gonna sit tight.

235
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:03,789
We're on it.

236
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:17,789
<font color="#ff8c00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>
<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

237
00:08:20,237 --> 00:08:21,904
You know what
the lesson is here?

238
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:23,606
Don't get arrested
in the suburbs.

239
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,908
Not on a Thursday night.

240
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:29,044
Unfortunately, we need
a little relief now, Your Honor.

241
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:30,579
I can't help you on the arrest.

242
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,746
Oh, no, it's not that.

243
00:08:31,747 --> 00:08:33,448
We just need to get
my client transferred

244
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:35,550
so we can get a bail hearing
here on the weekend.

245
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:37,352
Otherwise she's stuck
in the suburbs till Monday.

246
00:08:37,353 --> 00:08:38,653
Skokie won't transfer her?

247
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:40,388
She missed the last transport.

248
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:43,858
Please, Your Honor?

249
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,393
How's Peter doing?

250
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:48,829
Good. Well.

251
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,865
I bet you that bitch
is nipping at his heels, huh?

252
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,268
Yes.

253
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:55,736
Hey, John.

254
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,505
It's Tommy, upriver.

255
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:59,039
How you doing?

256
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,242
Listen, you've got an arrestee
there by the name of...

257
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:03,109
Elsbeth Tascioni.

258
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,811
...Elsbeth Tascioni?

259
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,181
Yeah, listen, uh,

260
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,716
get another transport
to drag her ass up here, okay?

261
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,652
Yeah, it's nothing big.

262
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,354
(Chuckles)

263
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,489
What?

264
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,757
No, no, no, no, okay.

265
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,259
You do what you got to do.

266
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,560
All right.

267
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,728
Thank you. Bye.

268
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,633
Is your client erratic?

269
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,934
My... Why?

270
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:32,271
He says this Elsbeth has, uh,

271
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,438
been demonstrating
some erratic behavior,

272
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,072
and they have to do
a psych evaluation

273
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:36,740
before they can
transport her.

274
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:38,409
Liability.

275
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,511
Well, I can trump
a lot of things,

276
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:42,647
but I can't trump
insurance issues,

277
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,981
so you tell your client
to pass her psych eval

278
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,085
and I'll get her up here.

279
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,020
We think we can get
Elsbeth out in a few hours,

280
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:51,354
but I'll have to
take this for now.

281
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:52,689
They're going to do
the hearing here?

282
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,157
It's the only place
the arbitrators could find

283
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:56,660
on such short notice.

284
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:03,200
It's a three-judge panel
like any other appeals hearing.

285
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,268
We'll be fine.

286
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,035
<i>Le Tribunal Aribtral du Sport</i>

287

<i>Ca me fait plaisir</i>

297
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,086
What the hell? It's in French?

298
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:26,887
I don't know.
This is my first.

00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:35,496
I apologize for interrupting.

304
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,132
I don't speak French.

305
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:40,400
You... don't?

306
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:42,569
No, I'm sorry. This is...

307
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,170
all new to me.

(Laughter)

312
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:56,616
VILLAPIQUE: Mr. Plunkett from
the American Anti-Doping League

313
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:59,950
has agreed to let us conduct
this panel entirely in English

314
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,688
for your benefit, Mr....

315
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:04,323
Gardner, Will Gardner,

316
00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:07,260
from good old U.S. of A.

317
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:08,694
Good to know.

318
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:10,162
(Speaks French)

319
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:11,696
Good, so we're set to begin.

320
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:14,699
Please proceed, Mr. Gardner.

321
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,833
- Excuse me?
- Please proceed.

322
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,104
With?

323
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:21,339
Your defense.

324
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,875
What is the charge?

325
00:11:23,876 --> 00:11:25,277
There is no charge.

326
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:28,011
Miss Anna Buday has been banned
from Monday's race

327
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:29,780
due to her use of boosters,

328
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:31,348
dexitetrasolone.

329
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:32,949
If you have no defense,

330
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,868
there is no reason
for a hearing.

331
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:36,670
Yes, but Anna has passed
every drug test,

332
00:11:36,671 --> 00:11:39,206
including the one last week
for Monday's race, Your Honor.

333
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:40,341
Technically, she did

334
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:42,075
pass her drug test,
monsieur le président,

335
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,910
but afterward,
the tester found ghosting.

336
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,946
Her B-sample had the
same marker ratios

337
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:48,848
as the Notorious Six.

338
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,683
Notorious six?

339
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:52,652
Six runners banned from Monday's
race for using boosters,

340
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:53,819
designer drugs.

341
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,256
In fact, the tester found
a surge of ICSH,

342
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,590
interstitial cell stimulator,

343
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,291
the fingerprint
for booster use.

344
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:02,625
(Panel conversing in French)

345
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:06,365
Uh, I-I need...

346
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:09,568
I'm sorry. Excuse me, all right?

347
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:10,936
Objection.

348
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:12,237
There's no objection here,
Mr. Gardner.

349
00:12:12,238 --> 00:12:13,472
This is not <i>Law & Order.</i>

350
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:15,206
(Laughter)

351
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,640
Yeah. Thank you.

352
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:18,976
How do I express my displeasure

353
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:20,111
with something
that has transpired,

354
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:22,380
<i>- monsieur le...</i>
- You may speak it to me.

355
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:24,348
Well, given
that we've established

356
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:27,651
I flunked out of French, uh,
it seems unfair to conduct

357
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:29,720
in a colloquy in a language
unknown to the defendant.

358
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:31,654
- Appellant.
<i>- Merci, monsieur.</i>

359
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:33,223
VILLAPIQUE: Your point is
well-taken, Mr. Gardner.

360
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:34,257
And Mr. Plunkett

361
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:36,059
referred to a witness

362
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,393
who saw a courier carry drugs
to Anna Buday at the Olympics.

363
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:43,366
Here is the affidavit.

364
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:45,368
Well, then we call
this witness to the stand--

365
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:48,702
- Chenise Jayes.
- There is no stand, Mr. Gardner.

366
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,207
Well, to the chair
in the middle of the room.

367
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,909
(Panel conversing in French)

368
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,644
Excuse me, Your Honors...

369
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,879
Uh, I mean, uh, uh,
messieurs, uh, le présidents...

370
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,182
We are debating whether
to grant you your request

371
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:02,017
- to question your witness.
- Grant my request?

372
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:03,318
No.

373
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,519
<i>Oui.</i>

374
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,589
By a two to one margin,

375
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,023
we grant your request.

376
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:12,127
We shall suspend this panel
until we contact the witness.

377
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:13,294
(Gavel bangs)

378
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:14,962
I'm gonna need
to get some help here.

379
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:16,598
I'll be right back.

380
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,798
(Sighing)

381
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:24,338
(Cell phone ringing)

382
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:34,278
Will, how'd the deposition go?

383
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:36,849
What?

384
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,619
Yes, how's your French?

385
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,122
<i>"Elle était fort déshabillée</i>

386
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,591
<i>"Et de grands arbres indiscrets</i>

387
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,826
<i>"Aux vitres jetaient leur</i>

388
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,395
<i>"feuillée</i>

389
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,396
<i>Malinement, tout près,</i>
<i>tout près."</i>

390
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,131
Good.
I need you at a sports hearing.

391
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,732
Oh, ha, ha, ha.

392
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,701
Thank you. I have
a massage in two hours.

393
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,136
Diane, I need your help.

394
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,470
This CAS panel-- that's the
Court of Arbitration for Sport--

395
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,608
they're talking in French.

396
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:07,478
- What is this again?
- It's something for a friend.

397
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,945
I need your help, Diane.

398
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:11,081
Will, it's the weekend.

399
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:12,650
Another time.

400
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:14,851
It's Elsbeth Tascioni.

401
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:19,923
Where?

402
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:21,091
You are one of
the most brilliant

403
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:22,159
lawyers I have ever met.

404
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,593
Aw. Really?

405
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:25,295
But that's not
going to help you.

406
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:28,164
You need to pass
your psych eval.

407
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:30,933
Okay. How?

408
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:34,003
They're gonna ask
you 120 questions,

409
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,772
and they are going to
pause for a long time

410
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:40,106
between each question to
encourage you to talk.

411
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,311
And I'm not
supposed to talk?

412
00:14:42,312 --> 00:14:45,645
No, you are, but
just not as much

413
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:47,382
as you normally would.

414
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:49,318
- Do I talk too much?
- No. I just think

415
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:51,520
it's best to be... circumspect.

416
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:54,355
Okay.

417
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:55,956
So they'll ask you
questions like,

418
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,292
"Do you resent
being given advice?"

419
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:00,293
Oh, well, what advice?

420
00:15:00,294 --> 00:15:02,962
Just... any advice.

421
00:15:02,963 --> 00:15:04,731
Okay. But...

422
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:06,633
Of course not.
I like getting advice.

423
00:15:06,634 --> 00:15:08,968
Is that bad? Does that
make me seem noncommittal?

424
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:10,303
No. That's fine.

425
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:12,305
Just don't worry
about it afterward.

426
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:14,374
- Like I just did?
- Right.

427
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,508
Okay. Give me another one.

428
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,844
Um... um...

429
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:20,779
do you like
to stay active,

430
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,448
and are you bored
really easily?

431
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:23,815
No.

432
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:25,917
I mean...

433
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:27,853
I like to stay active,

434
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:30,689
but I don't really get bored.

435
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,041
That's a tough one, because
it's a compound question.

436
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,076
But I guess that's the point.

437
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:37,879
Huh. (Clicks tongue)

438
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,447
They want my mind to chase
down the two tracks.

439
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:43,781
Yes, that's why
they ask them that way.

440
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:46,521
So, it is best just to...

441
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:49,155
let the silence rest.

442
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,057
Okay?

443
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:52,559
Okay?

444
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,528
Oh. (Laughs)

445
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,795
Good. Exactly.

446
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:59,129
Good. Very good.

447
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:04,402
Thanks for doing this, Geneva.

448
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:06,437
For doing what?

449
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:08,605
Talking with me,
helping me.

450
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:10,107
Can I get you anything?

451
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:11,575
Water? Soda?

452
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:13,744
No. Thanks.

453
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:16,546
(Clears his throat)

454
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:18,749
So, how am I doing?

455
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,283
How are you doing?

456
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:22,552
Yeah, you know,
promotions, reductions,

457
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:25,387
fostering limited funds,
managing the office.

458
00:16:25,388 --> 00:16:27,824
That kind of thing.

459
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:29,525
Fine.

460
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:31,861
Uh-huh. Good.

461
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:34,197
And do you find any, uh,

462
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:37,266
bias in how I'm
handling things?

463
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:39,300
Well, I know. I know.

464
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:40,736
You're in my office,

465
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:43,205
and I'm asking you whether
I'm doing a good job.

466
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:46,274
It puts you in a very
uncomfortable position, I know.

467
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:47,976
But let me just say this.

468
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:49,444
I need to self-evaluate.

469
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:51,546
There will be
no repercussions

470
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:54,549
one way or another--
none-- so...

471
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,883
how am I doing
on racial bias?

472
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:02,890
You're asking about racial bias
in the office?

473
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:04,525
Yes.

474
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,427
And you want me
to speak honestly?

475
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:09,364
- Yes, and with no repercussions.
- You're racially biased.

476
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:13,533
I am?

477
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,669
Well, what do you mean by that?

478
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,772
You have fired
five African-Americans

479
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,874
and promoted two Caucasians.

480
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,041
That's racially biased.

481
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,210
Well, that's strictly
coincidence.

482
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,179
You're right.

483
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,447
- Thank you.
- Oh, wait.

484
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,781
Wait. Geneva,
I'm sorry.

485
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,454
Let's start over.

486
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,189
Tell me.

487
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,125
(Laughs)

488
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:43,459
Cary Agos was not ready
to be promoted to deputy.

489
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,531
Matan Brody was.
I was.

490
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,866
Together, we had two decades
more experience,

491
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,402
but you promoted Cary

492
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,404
because you liked him.

493
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,806
You fired Wendy Scott-Carr.

494
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,541
- You demoted Dana Lodge.
- Wait a minute.

495
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,742
There might have
been reasons.

496
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,376
There are always reasons.

497
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:01,812
But you didn't listen
to their reasons for staying.

498
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:04,715
It's about
who you listen to.

499
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,917
That's the key.

500
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,086
Well, let's say
that you're right.

501
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:11,622
What should I do?

502
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,357
Rethink.

503
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,325
Review all promotions.

504
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:18,160
Return hiring
to a pure meritocracy.

505
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:21,030
And you rejected the request
to speak at the Minority Rights

506
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:22,332
Coalition last week?

507
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,266
It was considered
a slap in the face.

508
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,268
So the Minority Rights
Coalition is offended?

509
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:28,270
Yes.

510
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:30,105
Your opponent is going.

511
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:32,974
I would talk to them.

512
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:35,076
You're a good talker.

513
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:36,645
Talk to them.

514
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:39,381
WOMAN:
<i>Chenise Jayes.</i>

515
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:42,715
I'm an anchor on the 400-meter
U.S. relay team,

516
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:43,868
and Anna's roommate.

517
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:45,170
VILLAPIQUE: This isn't
necessary, Mr. Gardner.

518
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,171
We know who she is.

519
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:47,871
Of course.
Thank you, Your...

520
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:50,774
Uh, <i>monsieur...</i>
<i>le président.</i>

521
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:52,743
So, you claimed
you saw a man giving my client,

522
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:53,944
Anna Buday, drugs.

523
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:55,279
Could you describe
what you saw?

524
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,948
Yeah. It was the night
before we left for London,

525
00:18:57,949 --> 00:19:00,585
and this Asian guy
in a Cubs cap shows up

526
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,153
around 2:00 in the morning.

527
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:04,954
And he was talking
all hush-hush,

528
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:06,623
and handed her
a bottle of pills,

529
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:08,425
and then Anna went
into the bathroom.

530
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:09,692
Did you see the pills?

531
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:11,094
Uh-uh, I was over on the couch.

532
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:12,962
Oh, couldn't they have been
vitamins or aspirin?

533
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:15,064
We had all that stuff
in our room.

534
00:19:15,065 --> 00:19:17,033
So you didn't know this guy?
You'd never seen him before?

535
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,236
I didn't know him at the time,
but now I do.

536
00:19:19,237 --> 00:19:20,436
- You do?
- Yeah.

537
00:19:20,437 --> 00:19:21,838
It was Nelson Kimora,

538
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,706
one of the
Notorious Six.

539
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:26,943
(Panel conversing in French)

540
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:32,548
Excuse me.

541
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:34,951
- Yes. - We are not stumbling
our way through anything.

542
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:37,686
And we ask that you show
our defense its due respect.

543
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:39,287
My apologies, madam.

544
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:40,856
We have come here

545
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:43,391
not to be prejudged,
and we ask nothing

546
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:46,294
other than you listen
to us with an open mind.

547
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:47,696
Uh, what is the quote?

548
00:19:47,697 --> 00:19:49,998
<i>"Ceux qui sont libérés</i>
<i>de préjugés ordinaires</i>

549
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,832
<i>peuvent acquérir</i>
<i>les autres."</i>

550
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,268
Prejudices have no place here.

551
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:56,203
Yes, you are right.

552
00:19:56,204 --> 00:19:57,304
My personal apology.

553
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:58,572
- Ask for something.
- Like what?

554
00:19:58,573 --> 00:19:59,707
I don't know.
Something.

555
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,676
Uh, and, uh, we ask the panel

556
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:04,045
for a brief recess
until tomorrow.

557
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:06,446
We are looking
at an <i>arrière-pensée</i>

558
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:08,148
- for this persecution.
PLUNKETT: I believe

559
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:10,050
the defendant has already been
allowed an extended break.

560
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:12,152
- Appellant.
VILLAPIQUE: I believe this panel

561
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:14,788
can allow the appellants time
to prepare

562
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,723
for their... <i>attaque au fer.</i>

563
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:18,692
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

564
00:20:19,693 --> 00:20:20,727
WILL:
<i>Okay, all those years</i>

565
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:23,329
I disparaged French
as a pointless class--

566
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,230
I take them back.
Nice job.

567
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:29,964
Anna, who is this guy
who visited you-- Nelson Kimora?

568
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,403
Someone on the
team, a sprinter.

569
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:32,938
- Did he bring you these drugs?
- No.

570
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:34,907
Did he bring you anything?

571
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:37,743
But he meant something to you.
I mean, who is he?

572
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:41,246
My boyfriend...
before the Olympics.

573
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:42,714
We're not
together now.

574
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:44,649
So he was your boyfriend,
but he didn't bring you drugs?

575
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,883
That's correct.

576
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:47,319
Anna, if you don't
tell us the truth,

577
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,621
- we can't help you.
- I am telling the truth.

578
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:50,988
There were no drugs.

579
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:52,524
Nothing happened.

580
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:55,327
ALICIA:
<i>And you don't believe her?</i>

581
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:57,261
DIANE:
She's, uh, hiding something.

582
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:58,429
We don't know what.

583
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,896
Maybe just her boyfriend's
drug use.

584
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:01,599
Or maybe she's hiding
the drugs for him.

585
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,766
Well, I don't know,

586
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:05,168
but we can't defend her
unless she tells us.

587
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:06,503
Could you check with Elsbeth?

588
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:08,171
She knows Anna more

589
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:09,607
than we do.

590
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:12,142
I already did, but she's in
a psych evaluation right now.

591
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:14,443
Well, when she's done,
would you ask her again?

592
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:15,878
We need some help
with Anna here.

593
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:17,246
We only have one more day left.

594
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:18,347
Okay.

595
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:20,315
I will, and, Diane,
thanks for doing this.

596
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:22,852
Hey, it's just the weekend.

597
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:25,555
MAN: Do you feel
guilty about drinking

598
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:27,957
or using chemicals?

599
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,659
I don't feel guilty
about drinking,

600
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,011
which I <i>do</i> do...

601
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:34,779
<i>Do</i> do?

602
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,682
But I don't
use chemicals,

603
00:21:37,683 --> 00:21:40,585
which, I imagine you
mean chemical stimulants,

604
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:43,919
so it would be impossible
to feel guilty about that.

605
00:21:48,777 --> 00:21:50,778
(Laughing)

606
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:53,714
Why did you laugh,
Ms. Tascioni?

607
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:55,616
No reason.

608
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:58,252
Just... your pause
seemed funny.

609
00:21:58,253 --> 00:21:59,553
Why?

610
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:01,789
- No reason.
- Well, there must be some reason.

611
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,123
No. Just the oddity
of human behavior.

612
00:22:06,027 --> 00:22:07,661
What do you mean,
the oddity?

613
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:09,496
What do I mean?

614
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:11,665
The...

615
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:15,902
Yes, Ms. Tascioni?

616
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:17,570
She was pregnant.

617
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:19,556
Excuse me?
(Gasps)

618
00:22:19,557 --> 00:22:22,291
ICSH is the male equivalent
of LH.

619
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:25,027
Luteinizing hormone,
a pregnancy-related hormone.

620
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:27,196
- Ms. Tascioni... - That's why the
unexplained hormonal surge.

621
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:28,997
It wasn't drug use.
She was pregnant.

622
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:31,400
- Do you mind? - But that was ten
months ago-- the Olympics.

623
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:33,669
- She doesn't have...
- I know. I know. Wait.

624
00:22:34,504 --> 00:22:36,138
The pills
her boyfriend brought her.

625
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:37,540
What if it wasn't boosters?

626
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,873
What if it was
mifepristone?

627
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:40,608
And that's why
she doesn't want to tell us.

628
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,111
You have to go talk to her, tell
her she has to tell the truth.

629
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,480
Okay.

630
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:48,983
(Sighs)

631
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:56,423
What was the question again?

632
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:58,325
You have to tell them.

633
00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:01,195
That I had an abortion?

634
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:03,163
No.

635
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,199
No, I can't.

636
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,934
Anna, you didn't dope.

637
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:10,203
You terminated
a pregnancy.

638
00:23:10,204 --> 00:23:12,205
You need to tell them.

639
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:13,606
I can't.

640
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:15,441
DIANE:
Your family?

641
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:17,610
My parents, my-my sister.

642
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:19,044
WILL:
They'll understand.

643
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:21,214
It's worse
that you were doping.

644
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:23,249
No.

645
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,218
It's not worse.

646
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:28,120
Not to my family, not to me.

647
00:23:30,523 --> 00:23:33,625
I wanted to medal.

648
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:36,161
I was pregnant,
and I wanted to medal.

649
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:42,333
Here's the problem, Anna.

650
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:45,667
We can defend you
with the truth.

651
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:47,738
If you tell the truth,

652
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:50,474
you will get
your $5 million contract,

653
00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:52,143
and you will run on Monday.

654
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:55,279
If you don't,
you will lose both.

655
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:59,616
Then I'll lose both.

656
00:24:01,652 --> 00:24:04,985
I can't break their hearts
in this, Will.

657
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:08,758
So what do we do?

658
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:12,028
You need to help me win this.

659
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:13,896
With a lie?

660
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:17,230
If that's what it takes.

661
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:30,410
Hi. Um, how's it going?

662
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,247
No, no, no, no, no, no, I...
I was just checking in.

663
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:35,982
Oh, thanks.

664
00:24:35,983 --> 00:24:37,449
So, what are you doing?

665
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,419
Trying to get a lawyer out
of lockup. What about you?

666
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,089
I'm, uh, watching
Eli and Jordan

667
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,923
argue over whether
I should go

668
00:24:44,924 --> 00:24:46,858
to the Minority Rights
Coalition today.

669
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,760
What did you say
you were doing?

670
00:24:48,761 --> 00:24:51,363
A lawyer friend of mine
got arrested in Skokie,

671
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,865
and she missed the transport
to her bail hearing.

672
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:54,933
That's not good.

673
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,368
Why don't you have
the presiding judge

674
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,435
transport her downtown?

675
00:24:57,436 --> 00:24:58,469
I tried that.

676
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,471
The lawyer failed
her psych eval.

677
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:02,306
Mmm. Liability.

678
00:25:02,307 --> 00:25:04,508
You want me to make a call?

679
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,744
Could you?

680
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:09,579
Yeah. What's the lawyer's name?

681
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,215
You know her. Elsbeth Tascioni.

682
00:25:11,216 --> 00:25:12,216
Ah.

683
00:25:12,217 --> 00:25:13,517
What?

684
00:25:13,518 --> 00:25:15,619
She was the lawyer
on my retrial.

685
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,686
It's gonna look

686
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:18,554
- like a political favor.
- Not a personal one.

687
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:20,790
Right. Um...

688
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:21,891
look, let me think about it.

689
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:22,892
No, no.

690
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:24,760
Peter, that is not why I called.

691
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:26,796
Why did you call?

692
00:25:26,797 --> 00:25:30,130
Uh... I was just checking in.

693
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:32,168
Oh. Then why don't you...

694
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:34,169
come visit me
at the campaign bus?

695
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,905
We're at Morgan Park, and then
maybe we'll get a bite to eat.

696
00:25:36,906 --> 00:25:38,840
If I get a break, I will.

697
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:41,543
Good. And one thing you might
try with Elsbeth--

698
00:25:41,544 --> 00:25:43,412
question the arrest itself.

699
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:44,879
Make it a constitutional issue,

700
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,381
and that way,
the presiding judge

701
00:25:46,382 --> 00:25:48,116
will have to transport her.

702
00:25:48,117 --> 00:25:49,383
Good. Thanks.

703
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:50,684
All right. See you.

704
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:52,619
DIANE:

00:26:00,062 --> 00:26:02,696
My mistake.
So, you are the chemist

711
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:04,365
who tested Anna
Buday's B-sample?

712
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:06,433
I'm lead analyst at Edgar Labs.

713
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:08,601
We test and interpret samples
for all U.S. athletes.

714
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:09,669
So that's a yes?

715
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,372
- Yes.
- And you are familiar with

716
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:14,341
the booster scandal, <i>docteur?</i>

717
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:15,741
Yes, I'm the one
who discovered it.

718
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:18,945
- And the new compound, dexitetrasolone.
- Uh-huh.

719
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:21,680
And after you discovered it,
did you test this... substance?

720
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,849
No.

721
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,318
We're still waiting on
subpoenas of private labs

722
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,220
- in China who manufacture it.
DIANE: I see, so...

723
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:30,255
you have never seen
this mysterious substance.

724
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,091
You have never held it,
never tested it.

725
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,626
- So how can you be positive
it even exists?  - I don't need

726
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:37,128
the actual drug to know
that it's real, ma'am.

727
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,230
Think of contrails
from an airplane--

728
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,764
they don't just appear;

729
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,932
Something had
to make them.

730
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,767
So how do you prove definitely

731
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,503
that Anna used
this compound

732
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,871
when she denies it?

733
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,172
Does she have contrails?

734
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,640
PLUNKETT:
If we are to argue

735
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,909
in metaphors, gentlemen,
then contrails are enough.

736
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,377
They were enough
with Lance Armstrong.

737
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,345
I'm sorry.
Is it your turn to argue?

738
00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:56,613
This isn't
about arguments.

739
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,015
These Chicago lawyers
continue to think

740
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,449
that this is
an adversarial proceeding.

741
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,651
Oh, our mistake. I guess
we should all just agree

742
00:27:01,652 --> 00:27:04,254
- Anna is guilty.
VILLAPIQUE:
- This is not an American court, Mr. Gardner.

743
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,156
There's no need to be
at each other's throat.

744
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,491
Uh, this is not <i>Rambo.</i>

745
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:10,159
<i>Les règles d'LAAD</i>

746
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,927
<i>n'exigent pas</i>
<i>la preuve définitif.</i>

747
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:14,763
The rules don't
require actual proof

748
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:16,765
to keep her from
running on Monday.

749
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:18,834
We have to find
another way.

750
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:20,669
Hi.

751
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,071
- Hi.
- What do you need?

752
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:24,806
Will and Diane are running
into a dead end at the CAS

753
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:27,475
and have asked me
to review your trial notes.

754
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:29,177
These.

755
00:27:29,178 --> 00:27:31,679
- Diane? Diane's on it, too?
- Yeah.

756
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,214
She's so elegant.

757
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,518
Yeah. Um...

758
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,652
what does that say?

759
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:39,954
That's background
on Dr. Chesterfield.

760
00:27:39,955 --> 00:27:42,122
- What happened with him?
- Contrails.

761
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:43,357
(Sighs)
Yeah.

762
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:45,059
He loves his contrails.

763
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,394
The problem with doping charges
is the burden of proof

764
00:27:47,395 --> 00:27:50,728
is reversed-- you have
to prove you're innocent.

765
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:53,267
- What?
- Where's Alicia?

766
00:27:53,268 --> 00:27:55,135
She's trying to get you
a trial downtown,

767
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:57,303
but what is it
you were about to say?

768
00:27:57,304 --> 00:27:59,305
- Me?
- Yeah.

769
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:01,640
Oh, yes.
Tell Will and Diane

770
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:03,676
they have to attack
the three pillars.

771
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:05,678
- The three...
- Pillars.

772
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,046
It's the way
they substantiate

773
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:10,380
doping charges--
Pillar one: Analysis.

774
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,351
I guess we lost on that one.

775
00:28:12,352 --> 00:28:14,719
- What are the other two?
- Uh, I-I don't know.

776
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,754
- No, I'm asking myself.
- Oh.

777
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:18,856
Co... confidentiality.

778
00:28:18,857 --> 00:28:21,460
And, uh...
chain of custody.

779
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:24,162
- Chain of custody?
- Yes. Like a three-legged stool,

780
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:26,798
you knock that out,
the CAS falls over.

781
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,400
(Chuckles)
Okay. Thanks.

782
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:31,768
- You know what?
- What?

783
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:33,737
I hate depending
on other people.

784
00:28:33,738 --> 00:28:35,372
(Chuckles)
Me, too.

785
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:37,107
Look, I'll be back.
(Door opens)

786
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:40,176
Oh, looks like your transport
downtown has arrived.

787
00:28:41,478 --> 00:28:43,313
(Gasps)
Yay!

788
00:28:43,314 --> 00:28:44,947
PETER:
<i>Now, we all know</i>

789
00:28:44,948 --> 00:28:47,817
<i>that I have made mistakes,</i>
<i>but I want to learn.</i>

790
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:50,086
That's why I'm here
speaking to you,

791
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:52,421
- the Minority Rights Coalition.
MADDIE: Three debates?

792
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:54,823
You do the voters a disservice
if you give them anything less.

793
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:57,058
Oh, yes, that's what
this is all about,

794
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:58,393
doing the voters a service.

795
00:28:58,394 --> 00:28:59,928
- We'll consider three.
- We will not. Two.

796
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:01,363
You give us
two town halls,

797
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,698
- we will consider three.
- This is not an official negotiation.

798
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:04,699
Why not, Eli?

799
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,800
- What's wrong with three?
- Maddie,

800
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:07,402
send your representatives
over to me...

801
00:29:07,403 --> 00:29:08,837
I do things myself.

802
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:10,872
Write my own speeches,
spend my own money.

803
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:12,707
Why don't we just shake
right now on three?

804
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,375
No. Not right now.

805
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:15,710
(Audience clamoring)

806
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:17,545
My office...

807
00:29:17,546 --> 00:29:19,814
prosecutes more
African-Americans

808
00:29:19,815 --> 00:29:21,816
than any other group,

809
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:23,417
and I want to know why.

810
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:26,319
(Audience jeering)

811
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,089
<i>President Obama...</i>

812
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,423
<i>promised a discussion</i>
<i>on race in this country.</i>

813
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:35,729
<i>We've never had it.</i>

814
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,899
I'm not the type that likes
to point fingers, Eli, but...

815
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,867
you should listen
to me more.

816
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:42,802
I know what I'm doing.

817
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:49,475
ALICIA: No, court's
at 9:00 tomorrow.

818
00:29:49,476 --> 00:29:51,377
I should have her out by noon.

819
00:29:51,378 --> 00:29:52,578
Okay, got to go.

820
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:55,912
- Did... you have a break?
- Yeah.

821
00:29:56,383 --> 00:29:59,617
- You all right?
- Yeah. It was a...

822
00:29:59,618 --> 00:30:01,820
just a bad speech.

823
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:04,790
You have time for a bite?

824
00:30:06,492 --> 00:30:08,960
Sure.

ELI (Outside):

00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:31,314
It's not as bad as you think.

831

832
00:30:36,053 --> 00:30:37,954

00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:53,368
Okay.

Oh, no, no, just...

00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:18,458
Okay.

850
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,360

851
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:22,195
You want some water?

852
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,765
Sure.

853
00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:31,004
Oh. Don't worry.

854
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:33,205
Just the wife.

855
00:31:46,265 --> 00:31:48,482
ALICIA: That is not
true, Your Honor.

856
00:31:48,483 --> 00:31:49,816
This is a constitutional matter.

857
00:31:49,817 --> 00:31:51,185
No, it is a stupid matter.

858
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:52,353
Would one of you take a break

859
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:54,354
from your scrimmage
and please fill me in?

860
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:56,956
Ms. Tascioni was arrested
for harassing Mr. Fassel,

861
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,891
CEO of Erobos Sports
and a defendant...

862
00:31:58,892 --> 00:32:00,826
He was speaking
at Braddock University

863
00:32:00,827 --> 00:32:02,260
- and invited questions.
- Yes, which would've

864
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:04,396
been fine, except she followed
him out to his car.

865
00:32:04,397 --> 00:32:05,965
What is the constitutional
matter here?

866
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,466
ALICIA: The campus
police who arrested

867
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,968
Ms. Tascioni did so
illegally by leaving

868
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,236
- their area of jurisdiction.
- That's why we're here on a Sunday?

869
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:13,471
As you can see
from this map, Your Honor,

870
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:15,773
the campus police
arrested Ms. Tascioni

871
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:17,441
beside Mr. Fassel's car

872
00:32:17,442 --> 00:32:18,943
here in Parking Garage C.

873
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,645
Which is a part
of the university grounds.

874
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:22,079
No, it is aDJacent
to the university,

875
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,413
but it is owned by the Illinois
Trust & Loan Bank here.

876
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,518
(Whispers):
Fassel's lawyer.

877
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,185
Okay. Your Honor,

878
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:31,989
if we're sinking to this level
of ludicrousity...

879
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,757
- "Ludicrousity"?
- Braddock University

880
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:36,059
leases the garage
from Illinois Trust,

881
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,093
and is thus entrusted

882
00:32:37,094 --> 00:32:38,061
to patrol it.

883
00:32:38,062 --> 00:32:39,195
Not the second
and third floor.

884
00:32:39,196 --> 00:32:40,263
How do you know that?

885
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:41,464
I don't know how I know

886
00:32:41,465 --> 00:32:42,498
half the things I know.

887
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:43,599
POLITI:
Mrs. Florrick?

888
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,734
Yes, Your Honor.

889
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:46,602
The university does not lease

890
00:32:46,603 --> 00:32:47,670
the second and
third floors.

891
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:49,572
It only leases the...

892
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:50,673
First and the fourth.

893
00:32:50,674 --> 00:32:51,908
...the first
and the fourth floors.

894
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:53,075
The second and third floors

895
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:54,844
are for bank customer
parking only.

896
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:57,612
Ms. Tascioni was arrested on...

897
00:32:57,613 --> 00:32:58,647
The third floor stairwell.

898
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:01,716
...in the third floor stairwell.

899
00:33:05,054 --> 00:33:07,689
Okay, here's how
we're doing things.

900
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,759
The four of you get all of your
whispering out of the way.

901
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,561
Go and discuss everything
you want to discuss

902
00:33:13,562 --> 00:33:14,494
outside the court.

903
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:16,063
Come back in here
in 20 minutes

904
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:17,731
with your best arguments.

905
00:33:17,732 --> 00:33:18,766
And Ms. Pine?

906
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:20,200
I have to say this.

907
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:22,069
I'm inclined to
toss this arrest,

908
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,403
'cause I, too,
think it's stupid.

909
00:33:25,473 --> 00:33:28,576
So, Anna Buday gave
a urine sample

910
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:31,410
on the 20th of July 2012
at 7:00 a.m.?

911
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:32,946
Yes, that's what
my intake form states.

912
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:34,146
Good.

913
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:35,548
And that was the sample

914
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:37,450
that led you to conclude
that Anna had

915
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:39,218
a contrail, <i>oui?</i>

916
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:40,920
Well, that she had
a burst of ICSH.

917
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:42,622
Similar to the Notorious Six.

918
00:33:42,623 --> 00:33:44,223
Ah. No more metaphors.

919
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:45,391
Good.

920
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:47,659
And when did
the technician

921
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,494
give the sample
to your designated

922
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:50,629
- shipping company?
- I don't know.

923
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,630
Well, hopefully

924
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:52,965
this will refresh your memory.

925
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:55,067
It is a receipt
for the shipping of the sample.

926
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:57,970
Can you see the time
and the date there?

927
00:33:57,971 --> 00:33:59,304
Would you read it?

928
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:01,172
July 21, 5:18 p.m.

929
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:05,906
Rule 44G, subpart M of
the AADL code states,

930
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,344
"All samples shall be shipped

931
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,647
"via approved courier
on the same day

932
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:10,781
that they are
collected."

933
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,016
I am aware of the code.

934
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,317
"Any unexplained
delay in shipping

935
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,485
"will constitute a break

936
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:16,153
"in the chain
of custody,

937
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,721
and the test must be discarded."

938
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,356
Occasionally, a technician
is unable to mail the sample

939
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:23,459
on the same day, usually because
the courier is closed.

940
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,361
There's no violation
as long as the sample

941
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:26,529
remains in our facility.

942
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,031
You're right.
That is why we,

943
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,799
um...

944
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:35,638
<i>Merci, mademoiselle.</i>

945
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:38,040
That is why we
checked the log

946
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,574
at your testing
facility.

947
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:41,844
It was closed.

948
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:43,712
It could not have remained
in your facility.

949
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:45,047
It must have remained
with this technician.

950
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:46,314
PLUNKETT:
Objection.

951
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:47,716
This is a respect
of form over substance.

952
00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:49,384
I thought there were
no objections.

953
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:50,685
PLUNKETT: There is
no scientific way

954
00:34:50,686 --> 00:34:51,986
the delay in delivering
the sample

955
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:53,988
- could create a false positive.
- One moment, please.

956
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:57,322
(Speaking French)

957
00:34:57,492 --> 00:35:00,762
Judge Villapique says the sample
should still be allowed.

958
00:35:00,763 --> 00:35:03,297
- Why?
- The delay was a technicality.

959
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:06,631
DIANE:
The Italian judge is for us.

960
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:08,769
The German is

961
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,436
against us,
but not as strongly.

962
00:35:10,437 --> 00:35:13,473
(Speaking French)

963
00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:16,742
Villapique says this is what
comes from these Rambo tactics.

964
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:18,110
What is it with
him and Rambo?

965
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:19,479
Does anybody even
watch <i>Rambo</i> anymore?

966
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,047
(Speaking French)

967
00:35:21,048 --> 00:35:24,150
DIANE: He is suggesting a 30-minute
recess to discuss this further.

968
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:25,785
We need to flip the German.

969
00:35:25,786 --> 00:35:26,786
Where's Tascioni?

970
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:29,421
Here we are again.

971
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,356
With your argument
this time, Ms. Pine.

972
00:35:31,357 --> 00:35:34,690
While the State continues
to maintain the campus police's

973
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:38,230
jurisdiction included
the parking garage-- all levels

974
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:40,131
of said garage--
their arrest

975
00:35:40,132 --> 00:35:42,801
on the third floor
also qualifies

976
00:35:42,802 --> 00:35:44,702
for the hot pursuit exemption.

977
00:35:44,703 --> 00:35:46,504
Your Honor, please,
if I may borrow

978
00:35:46,505 --> 00:35:47,871
the ASA's word
"ludicrousity..."

979
00:35:47,872 --> 00:35:48,906
POLITI:
You may not.

980
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:50,007
I'm banning that word.

981
00:35:50,008 --> 00:35:52,510
ALICIA:
Um...

982
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:53,744
POLITI:
Mrs. Florrick...

983
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:55,446
The hot pursuit doctrine

984
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,682
applies only
in emergency situations

985
00:35:57,683 --> 00:35:59,282
when the officer
doesn't have time

986
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:00,550
to alert another jurisdiction.

987
00:36:00,551 --> 00:36:01,984
Neither of these elements
existed here.

988
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:03,152
GENEVA:
The defendant

989
00:36:03,153 --> 00:36:05,188
threatened a guest lecturer
at the university.

990
00:36:05,189 --> 00:36:07,757
He fled, she followed him,
verbally assaulting the victim

991
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:09,759
while he was trying to get
to his car.

992
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,994
Okay, okay.
Thank you, everyone.

993
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:14,231
I think we're gonna
make history here today,

994
00:36:14,232 --> 00:36:16,832
spending more time on less.

995
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:19,101
And yet, I have come
to my decision.

996
00:36:19,102 --> 00:36:21,604
Afterward, you can all appeal
to the Supreme Court.

997
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:23,038
He's gonna rule against us.

998
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,340
POLITI:
It was a legal arrest.

999
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:25,774
The campus police--

1000
00:36:25,775 --> 00:36:29,108
loath as I am to give them
any kind of a win--

1001
00:36:29,446 --> 00:36:32,080
did step out of their
jurisdiction, but with cause.

1002
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:33,248
And on that note...

1003
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:35,117
Your Honor, we request
that you allow Ms. Tascioni

1004
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:36,551
to be taken to bond court

1005
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:37,786
currently in session
down the hall.

1006
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:38,887
GENEVA:
No, Your Honor.

1007
00:36:38,888 --> 00:36:41,322
Respectfully, this court
lacks the authority

1008
00:36:41,323 --> 00:36:43,491
to overrule a Skokie
psychologist's determination

1009
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,093
on her mental state.

1010
00:36:45,094 --> 00:36:47,428
Your Honor, it was in Skokie
that they determined

1011
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:49,897
that my client was too risky
for transport, yet here she is.

1012
00:36:49,898 --> 00:36:51,265
If you rule against her,

1013
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:52,466
they will take her
back to Skokie

1014
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:54,368
and then drive her
back here again on Monday.

1015
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:56,070
This is
bureaucratic insanity.

1016
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:57,537
And yet, it's the law.

1017
00:36:57,538 --> 00:37:00,775
What is even more insane
is this emergency hearing,

1018
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:01,842
which was just deployed

1019
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:03,610
to get the defendant here
in the first place.

1020
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:06,413
Your Honor, all we are asking
is that you allow my client

1021
00:37:06,414 --> 00:37:08,315
- to walk down the hall. - We request
that Ms. Florrick be sanctioned.

1022
00:37:08,316 --> 00:37:09,616
Oh, my God.
(Gavel slams)

1023
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:11,217
Stop it. Seriously, stop.

1024
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:14,551
Please, go find some criminals
to prosecute and defend.

1025
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:18,158
Jim, please escort the
defendant down to bond court

1026
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,593
so she can post bail.

1027
00:37:19,594 --> 00:37:21,460
GENEVA: Your Honor, that is not...
- Come on, Ms. Pine.

1028
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:24,229
When the law is an ass,
someone has to kick it.

1029
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,899
(Squeals, laughs)
POLITI: You can do all your crying

1030
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,434
and hugging
down the hall.

1031
00:37:28,435 --> 00:37:29,669
Get her out of here.

1032
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:41,780
Thank you all
for the fervor and passion

1033
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:43,749
you brought to our proceedings.

1034
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,284
It has been quite dramatic.

1035
00:37:45,285 --> 00:37:48,620
We have considered
your arguments, pro and con,

1036
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:50,187
and we have decided against

1037
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:52,356
your chain of
custody concern.

1038
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:54,091
You've decided?
It's in your own rule book.

1039
00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:55,826
You can't just decide.

1040
00:37:55,827 --> 00:37:59,096
Yes, it's in our discretion
to apply the guidelines

1041
00:37:59,097 --> 00:38:02,430
as we see fit, depending
on the unique set of facts.

1042
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:03,667
The ruling stands.

1043
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:04,768
So, they're
guidelines now?

1044
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:07,370
(Speaking French)

1045
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:08,871
ELSBET
I'm coming!

1046
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:09,872
Hi!

1047
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:10,940
I'm here!

1048
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:12,308
I'm here.

1049
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:13,476
Hello?

1050
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:15,145
I'm coming.

1051
00:38:15,146 --> 00:38:16,279
Sorry.
(Laughs)

1052
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,213
I was delayed.

1053
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:18,648
Uh, <i>pardonnez-moi,</i>
<i>messieurs.</i>

1054
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:20,483
<i>Puissionsnous</i>
<i>confèrent un instant?</i>

1055
00:38:20,484 --> 00:38:21,951
We are ready, Your Honor.

1056
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,352
We have a new lawyer
joining us.

1057
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:26,686
Ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow. Okay.

1058
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:28,123
Sorry.

1059
00:38:28,124 --> 00:38:31,457
<i>Je tiens à appeler un</i>
<i>autre témoin, messieurs.</i>

1060
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,862
We're conducting this
in English, Elsbeth.

1061
00:38:33,863 --> 00:38:35,597
Ah, well, Yes.

1062
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:38,699
Will! Hey.

1063
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,135
Oh, thank you.

1064
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:44,469
And Diane.

1065
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,674
- ...what an elegant dress.
(Laughs) Thank you.

1066
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:49,577
Uh, I've just been
really moved by

1067
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:50,545
you guys doing this...

1068
00:38:50,546 --> 00:38:52,113
Excuse me.

1069
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:54,714
We have a hearing.

1070
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:56,916
Ah, yes.
(Giggles)

1071
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:03,123
Hi. I'm Elsbeth Tascioni,

1072
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:06,193
and I am late
because I was under arrest.

1073
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:09,463
But I have one more witness:
Dedrick Klein.

1074
00:39:09,464 --> 00:39:11,897
Mr. Klein, the cyclist?

1075
00:39:11,898 --> 00:39:13,332
Why is he here?

1076
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,401
To speak regarding
the CAS rule application.

1077
00:39:15,402 --> 00:39:18,036
I don't think
we need this witness.

1078
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:20,172
<i>Pourquoi?</i>

1079
00:39:20,173 --> 00:39:22,708
<i>Pourquoi ne pouvons-nous</i>
<i>entendre Klein?</i>

1080
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:25,344
(Conversation continues
in French)

1081
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:28,146
Uh, uh, uh, gentlemen?

1082
00:39:28,147 --> 00:39:29,947
Gentlemen, please, please.

1083
00:39:29,948 --> 00:39:31,382
We ask for a consensus.

1084
00:39:31,383 --> 00:39:33,951
Par un vote à main levée.

1085
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:39,357
ELSBETH:
Judge Villapique,

1086
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:41,259
you're outvoted
two to one.

1087
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,693
Thanks for coming,
Mr. Klein.

1088
00:39:43,694 --> 00:39:44,694
Welcome.

1089
00:39:44,695 --> 00:39:46,597
Two years ago, you were accused

1090
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:49,931
of using banned substances
and suspended from cycling.

1091
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:52,401
Did you appeal like Anna?

1092
00:39:52,502 --> 00:39:53,137
Yes.

1093
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:54,638
My arbitration
was in Lausanne.

1094
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:57,941
- And can you tell us what happened?
- Yes.

1095
00:39:57,942 --> 00:39:59,108
There was no evidence,

1096
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:02,077
but the panel confirmed
my guilt, two to one.

1097
00:40:02,578 --> 00:40:05,411
Judge Villapique convinced
the Egyptian judges,

1098
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:06,682
- which is wrong.
- Excuse me.

1099
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:07,716
This is not relevant.

1100
00:40:07,717 --> 00:40:09,485
So, Judge Villapique
was on your panel?

1101
00:40:09,486 --> 00:40:11,154
KLEIN: Yes.
VILLAPIQUE: I think Mr. Plunkett

1102
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:12,388
makes a very good
observation.

1103
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:14,222
The relevance
has not been established.

1104
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:15,290
Uh, you were the one?

1105
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:16,924
The witness is excused.

1106
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:18,627
You pushed our
cyclist out?

1107
00:40:18,628 --> 00:40:20,094
Mr. Klein's arbitration
was confidential.

1108
00:40:20,095 --> 00:40:21,863
ELSBETH:
Except if the athlete

1109
00:40:21,864 --> 00:40:25,099
chose to waive confidentiality,
which Mr. Klein just did.

1110
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,301
She's correct.

1111
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:28,002
ELSBETH: Mr. Klein, who
convinced the Egyptian judge

1112
00:40:28,003 --> 00:40:29,003
to vote against you?

1113
00:40:29,004 --> 00:40:30,837
Judge Villapique.

1114
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:32,306
And when you were
stripped of your title,

1115
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,741
who was the runner-up?
Xavier Lanier.

1116
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:36,843
Xavier Lanier, who is French?

1117
00:40:36,844 --> 00:40:38,812
KLEIN: Yes.
- This has nothing to do with it.

1118
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:40,548
I'm appalled by the insinuation.

1119
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:42,149
Antoine, you should
have recused yourself.

1120
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,151
He cheated.
He didn't deserve that medal.

1121
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:46,352
(Speaking French)

1122
00:40:50,257 --> 00:40:52,592
(Panel arguing in French)

1123
00:40:57,931 --> 00:41:00,366
I just realized...

1124
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:02,168
you're Rambo.

1125
00:41:03,236 --> 00:41:05,237
PETER:
<i>President Obama</i>

1126
00:41:05,738 --> 00:41:09,071
promised a discussion
on race in this country.

1127
00:41:09,642 --> 00:41:11,376
Well, now, why would I
want to hear that?

1128
00:41:11,377 --> 00:41:13,679
Because it went viral.

1129
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,146
Because people
are calling you brave,

1130
00:41:15,147 --> 00:41:16,348
standing up
to special interests.

1131
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,416
Let's wait till
the polls

1132
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:18,416
come out tomorrow.

1133
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:19,650
Yeah, let's wait.

1134
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:21,985
The polls will prove
what the editorials are saying.

1135
00:41:21,986 --> 00:41:23,787
This is your
Sister Souljah moment.

1136
00:41:23,788 --> 00:41:26,156
ELI: You spoke truth
to minority interests,

1137
00:41:26,157 --> 00:41:27,658
so when those two ASAs
go public,

1138
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:28,826
they'll be seen as sour grapes.

1139
00:41:28,827 --> 00:41:29,993
You inoculated yourself.

1140
00:41:29,994 --> 00:41:30,961
Yeah, that's some win.

1141
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:32,796
Winning by pissing
off minorities.

1142
00:41:32,797 --> 00:41:34,664
Here's a thing that some people
just never learn.

1143
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:36,566
We are not teaching
a fifth-grade ethics class.

1144
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:37,767
We're here to win.

1145
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:39,902
Win pretty, win ugly--
it's still winning.

1146
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:47,076
(Door opens and closes)

1147
00:41:47,077 --> 00:41:48,244
Go easier on him, Eli.

1148
00:41:48,245 --> 00:41:49,411
Why?

1149
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:50,880
Because we need him.

1150
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:52,481
Why?

1151
00:41:53,482 --> 00:41:55,351
Do you want to get
into this now?

1152
00:41:55,352 --> 00:41:56,584
I want to know why we need him.

1153
00:41:56,585 --> 00:41:57,919
Are you being investigated?

1154
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,491
Then you know why.

1155
00:42:08,263 --> 00:42:10,632
ELSBETH:
To my friends.

1156
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:13,467
Thank you for getting me
out of the suburbs.

1157
00:42:13,468 --> 00:42:14,269
WILL:
No need to thank us.

1158
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,137
Especially once
you see the bill.

1159
00:42:16,138 --> 00:42:17,204
(Diane laughs)

1160
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,440
Eli.

1161
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:22,075
What are you doing?

1162
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:24,110
Nothing.

1163
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:26,512
Okay.

1164
00:42:26,513 --> 00:42:28,248
What are you doing?

1165
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:30,883
You know I'm being
investigated?

1166
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:32,585
Yes.

1167
00:42:33,336 --> 00:42:36,638
And you know I'm being
edged out of the campaign?

1168
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:38,324
No, I didn't know that.

1169
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:40,092
And you guys can't represent me

1170
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:41,193
because you're being
investigated.

1171
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:43,829
Yes, I had heard that.

1172
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,663
I need a lawyer to represent me.

1173
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:51,869
Ms. Tascioni?

1174
00:42:52,505 --> 00:42:54,105
Got a minute?

1175
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,807
Sure.

1176
