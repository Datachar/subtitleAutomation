00:00:00,727 --> 00:00:01,681
<i>(Tessa) In high school,</i>

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:03,684
<i>there's practically no
limit to the number of things</i>

3
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:06,496
<i>you can try your hand
at. In a surprise move,</i>

4
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:10,495
<i>I had recently signed
up for liking Ryan Shay.</i>

5
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:12,536
A year ago, I would've
looked over there and thought,

6
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:14,452
"what a bunch of dumb jocks."

7
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:16,994
And now I look over there and think...

8
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:18,230
"Hey, Ryan."

9
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,036
I think this whole adoption thing

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,577
has really helped humanize him,

11
00:00:21,593 --> 00:00:23,994
you know, like when we
found out about Dave Thomas.

12
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:27,513
Suddenly his frozen dairy
dessert tasted bittersweet.

13
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:29,421
Good day, Miss Altman.

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,121
Keeping it tight, I presume?

15
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,026
What's wrong with you?

16
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:34,301
(Lowered voice) I didn't
know if people at school

17
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,126
were supposed to know about us or not.

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
Know what?

19
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:40,190
About our love and how tender it is.

20
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,896
Don't be weird. I don't care.

21
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:45,907
You hear that, Chatswin?

22
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:47,072
She doesn't care!

23
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,699
Tessa and I aren't embarrassed

24
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,943
to express how tender our love is.

25
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:52,812
It's extremely tender!

26
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,500
(Boy laughs) (Boy) Yeah!

27
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,531
(Students speaking indistinctly, boy hoots)

28
00:00:57,582 --> 00:01:00,391
Congratulations, Tessa.

29
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:01,807
I had no idea things

30
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:03,267
were so tender between the two of you.

31
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:04,919
No one in their wildest dreams

32
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:06,656
expected you to snag a football player.

33
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,603
It would be like that runner with no legs

34
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:09,541
winning the Olympics.

35
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:10,378
Thanks.

36
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:13,154
Listen, you're a football girlfriend now.

37
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,079
And we're going to look past
your negativity and smugness

38
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,184
and embrace you, because that's
what football girlfriends do.

39
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:21,600
You can shadow me till
you get the hang of it.

40
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,360
Don't worry. You're in good hands.

41
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,440
Amber's trained some

42
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:26,481
of the best football
girlfriends in the field.

43
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,131
You should put that on
your college application.

44
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:29,710
Why would I go to college?

45
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,704
I've already met my future husband.

46
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:34,332
<i>From now on, before signing up for things,</i>

47
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,123
<i>I should remember to read the fine print.</i>

48
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:39,564
Look at that fine print and
look at the D.P.I., George.

49
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:40,807
Just look at it!

50
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:42,692
This printer is the best thing
that's ever happened to me,

51
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:44,522
and I met garry Shandling.

52
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,947
With this printer, I can finally
print people's dreams come true.

53
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,324
But this isn't my dream, right?

54
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,716
Don't be silly. You're a monarch.

55
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:54,118
See how lush and
saturated you look, George?

56
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:56,050
Even Yakult said you look saturated.

57
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,624
Yes. Okay. Thank you,
Dallas, this is very sweet.

58
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:01,126
- I appreciate it.
- Should we start cutting the tabs?

59
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:02,369
I have to go meet Noah.

60
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:05,639
- George?
- Huh?

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,859
What is that?

62
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:09,019
Oh. That's just some files and stuff.

63
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,301
They don't look like files.

64
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:12,641
They look like more of my flyers.

65
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:15,169
Yeah, that... that... that's what I said.

66
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:16,502
File-ers.

67
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:18,478
(Chuckles) Sometimes my
Southern accent comes out

68
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:20,368
from my semester in Charleston.

69
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,446
Honey child. Oh.

(Alih Jay) * last night I
had a pleasant nightmare *

72
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:33,162
♪ da-da-da-da, da, da, da, da ♪

73
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,367
<i>They just made it so damn hard.</i>

74
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:39,618
This is where we bake

75
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:40,989
the treats for the goody bags

76
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:43,260
that we give to our boyfriends on game day.

77
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,787
We don't do it for the thank-yous

78
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:46,651
because they don't say thank you.

79
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:48,835
We do it because it's tons of fun.

80
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:54,234
So this is where we do
our boyfriends' homework

81
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,293
so they can focus on practice.

82
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,958
<i>So we do this for the thank-yous?</i>

83
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,335
Tessa, no. There are no thank-yous.

84
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:04,601
We do this because it helps our
guys to concentrate on victory,

85
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,428
and over time, their victories will start

86
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,267
to feel like your victories.

87
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:10,939
And that's it's own reward. You'll see.

88
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:15,050
(Door creaks)

89
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,034
And this is the pep rally nerve center.

90
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:20,011
Wow.

91
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:21,851
Looks like...

92
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,252
(Sighs) a sweatshop.

93
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:24,947
We call it the devotion pit.

94
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:26,899
It's where we make the T-shirts, banners,

95
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:29,496
and miscellaneous sundries
that express our love,

96
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:31,392
loyalty, and allegiance.

97
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,513
So you girls are
basically mindless servants

98
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,752
struggling to uphold outdated gender roles?

99
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:37,442
Now you got it.

100
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:38,975
And the longer you serve,

101
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:40,933
the louder you cheer. You'll see.

102
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:42,403
(Cell phone rings)

103
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,100
It's Derek. (Beep)

104
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:47,772
Let's go, Derek! Way to
dial that phone, baby!

105
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:49,449
Good phone answer, Joan.

106
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,162
(Under breath) Thanks.

107
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:52,027
(Whispers) No.

108
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:53,278
<i>Derek may have been into it,</i>

109
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:55,494
<i>but some people find
relentless cheer-leading...</i>

110
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:57,771
Stifling. You know, to... to me,

111
00:03:57,809 --> 00:03:59,817
each one of those flyers might as well say,

112
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,656
"I judge you, George Altman.

113
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:04,047
I judge you for not
being successful enough."

114
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,118
Dallas is judge-y. She is.

115
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:08,721
When she met me, I was not a skylight king.

116
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:10,973
Look, if you're the skylight king,

117
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:13,063
then she's the queen.

118
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:14,828
All right, and that, my
friends, is what they all want.

119
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,362
They want status. They...
they want stability.

120
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:18,069
They do.

121
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:20,221
Why do you think I became a dentist?

122
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:21,860
I could've been anything.

123
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,568
Have you ever seen me on the uneven bars?

124
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:26,140
He's like an eagle with arms.

125
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,291
And two legs.

126
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:29,442
And a monkey's face. He's like a monkey.

127
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:32,558
It doesn't seem fair that they
can thrust these roles upon us.

128
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:36,461
Forcing us to build miniature
cities in our basements.

129
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,659
I'm building a miniature
city in my basement.

130
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,204
- It's actually pretty cool.
- Okay.

131
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:42,324
Forget skylights.

132
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:45,027
If you could start any business
right now, what would it be?

133
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:48,843
I'd be in the business of rocking.

134
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:50,426
Ooh! Bad boy.

135
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:52,078
I was in a dad band a few years ago.

136
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:53,867
I played the bass guitar.

137
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:56,157
Slapped her silly. Named her Rhoda.

138
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:58,121
I'm a big fan of that TV show.

139
00:04:58,403 --> 00:05:01,080
<i>Loved it. Never missed an episode.</i>

140
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:04,234
Guys, we're dads... dads who rock.

141
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:05,698
Why is it

142
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:07,825
we are not rocking out together?

143
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:09,846
- I don't know.
- That's a good question!

144
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:13,265
Then what say ye? Dads,
shall we redefine who we are

145
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:15,064
and define who it is we want to be?

146
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:18,068
Yea, verily, shall we do something

147
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:20,784
that our partners can't control or dictate?

148
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:24,431
Shall we call our band "Sheila's Pets"?

149
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:26,371
No, Fred. No, we shall not.

150
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:28,004
That is a terrible name.

151
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,293
Oh.

152
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:38,246
So how are you and the
football girls getting along?

153
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:39,785
Great.

154
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:41,262
I knew you'd hit it off.

155
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,859
Amber's had a really interesting journey.

156
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:48,714
She always wanted to date
Renaldo, our tight end,

157
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,047
but she used to be fat.

158
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:53,894
Then she lost a ton of weight...

159
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:58,236
and then they hooked up.

160
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:01,470
No. Yeah, that's really interesting.

161
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:04,709
Yeah, it is interesting. It's
interesting and it's inspiring.

162
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,025
Really inspiring.

163
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:09,709
Yeah, she's got a great story.

164
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:12,437
Oh. Ah, that reminds me,
I'm supposed to give Renaldo

165
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:14,145
a noogie at 12:45.

166
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,677
I better go. Shoot.

167
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:16,622
Bye.

168
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:18,156
Bye-bye. Bye.

169
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:21,439
So wait. Did you actually
think that girl's story

170
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,897
- was interesting?
- Nope.

171
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,512
Right. So why aren't you
being honest with Ryan?

172
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:27,277
Okay, you know how sometimes I can...

173
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:30,149
be a little negative or... smug?

174
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,807
- Preachy at times.
- Right.

175
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:33,803
- Soapbox-y.
- Okay, Lisa. Yep.

176
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:37,373
<i>I'm... I'm trying not to do that.</i>

177
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,289
I'm just trying to be supportive.

178
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:40,576
Interesting.

179
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,095
Well, I guess conformity's
a small price to pay

180
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,774
if you want to date a
big, beefy football player.

181
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:50,601
So what, football's a
better sport than lacrosse?

182
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,003
Yes, Malik.

183
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,986
(Whispers) Ignore him.

184
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:56,551
Maybe this is what it means
to be dating Ryan, right?

185
00:06:56,544 --> 00:06:57,577
You know, some people's physiques

186
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,891
lend themselves more to lacrosse,

187
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:00,942
which... which is a lot
harder than it looks.

188
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:02,926
You are embarrassing yourself, Malik.

189
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:05,441
No, you are. Fawning over football players?

190
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,243
I'd like to see one of
them make a fast break

191
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:08,488
while maintaining his cradle.

192
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:11,334
Nobody knows what you're
talking about, Malik.

193
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:12,848
(Sighs)

194
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:14,237
(Whispers) Do you want to go sit...

195
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,090
No. No. Eat your food. Don't cause a scene.

196
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,323
Okay, so tonight we're working

197
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:20,411
on the giant paper banner

198
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:22,301
that the team will run
through at the pep rally.

199
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,647
Typically, we work with
puffy pens and glitter,

200
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,624
but if you want to try something else...

201
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:28,831
Don't. It's best if you just stick

202
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:30,339
with the puffy pens and glitter.

203
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:31,309
Okay.

204
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,349
I love your enthusiasm, Tessa.

205
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:37,228
All right. You got this?

206
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:40,218
(Laughs) I've played my
fair share of "rock band."

207
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:42,777
I'm talking four stars for "Black Hole Sun"

208
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:45,198
on "Expert," brosef. (Laughs)

209
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:48,014
(Plays fill)

210
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,285
All right, not bad. (Laughs)

211
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:52,374
(Plays funk riff)

212
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:54,984
Getting funky now.

213
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,643
Funky? I'm gonna funking funk
the funk out of Rhoda tonight.

214
00:07:57,663 --> 00:07:59,301
Rhoda's a filthy lady.

215
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,792
(Laughs) This is pretty
sweet, guys. Pretty sweet.

216
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,427
I have to say, it felt
good to finally tell Sheila

217
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:07,722
I found a deer tick and
had to run to urgent care.

218
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:10,325
Okay, I... I hereby
declare the first rehearsal

219
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,158
of full-on Fatherly Assault

220
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:15,256
<i>or Fathers of Mass Destrocktion</i>

221
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:16,388
in session!

222
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,984
Yo! (Laughs)

223
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:20,840
I see. So Sheila's Pets
isn't even on the ballot.

224
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:22,608
No, and... and since
we're talking about it,

225
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,478
I'm also vetoing the "Chickity
China" song from the set list.

226
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:27,706
- What?!
- Yeah, that's not the name of the song,

227
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:28,983
and no one wants to sing it.

228
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:31,279
Nobody wants to sing about Chinese chicken?

229
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:33,150
- I don't.
- N... neither of us do.

230
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:35,384
♪ Chickity China, the Chinese chicken ♪

231
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:37,568
Yes, I'm familiar with it. Still a no.

232
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:41,265
Sit down. Let's do this.
Here we go. (Clears throat)

233
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:46,777
- Is that a frog?
- What?

234
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:48,823
Are you... are you drawing
a frog on the banner?

235
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,999
You're not... you're not supposed to.

236
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:51,413
Oh. I...

237
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:52,909
just...

238
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,911
know how to draw them, so...

239
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:56,588
Yeah. I would... I would
just stick to the letters,

240
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:58,009
because if we draw pictures,

241
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,210
the players will stop and
look at 'em instead of...

242
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,775
Destroying the artwork
we spent all night making?

243
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,027
You seem a little bit on edge.

244
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:07,124
If you snip the tip, you can catch a buzz.

245
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:08,722
Makes the night go faster.

246
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:13,677
Yeah. I know another way to
make the night go by faster.

247
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,240
Know what it's called? Going home!

248
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:17,316
(Laughs)

249
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:19,299
Tessa. (Laughs)

250
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:21,201
(Lowered voice) Keep your voice down.

251
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:22,972
(Loudly) What's that? Oh, you think

252
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:25,293
it's dumb we can't draw frogs? I agree!

253
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:27,126
I... I never... I... I never said that.

254
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,560
Come on! I'm sure there's
all sorts of things you girls

255
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:31,393
wish you could do, but you
can't, because you're here.

256
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:33,489
You know what's better than being here?

257
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,053
There's nothing better. She's drunk.

258
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:36,323
I smell alcohol on her breath.

259
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,895
Well, it's called...

260
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:41,435
(Marker squeaks)

261
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,238
Going home.

262
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,853
I didn't want to get on a
soapbox, but I am on one.

263
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:57,202
Girls, your needs are just as
important as a football player's.

264
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:59,317
Look at Stephanie here. She's hungry.

265
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:01,356
She wants to go out for a slice.

266
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:02,751
How did she know that?

267
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,696
And you.

268
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:05,254
What's your name?

269
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,818
I'm Derek's girlfriend.

270
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:08,871
What is your name, child?

271
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:12,036
I... want to say... Joan.

272
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:13,613
(Clatter) I bet you do.

273
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:15,515
(Clicks tongue) You look like a Joan.

274
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:17,955
And what about that girl over there

275
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:20,095
with the bloody Jersey
wrapped around her hand?

276
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:22,234
Shouldn't she be seen by a doctor?

277
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,698
Sean says it's in my head.

278
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:25,406
It's not in your head.

279
00:10:25,387 --> 00:10:27,333
You are bleeding from your hand.

280
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,572
She should be in urgent care,

281
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:32,644
<i>and we should all be at home watching TV.</i>

282
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:35,378
It is 9:30 on a Wednesday night,

283
00:10:35,397 --> 00:10:37,261
and there has gotta be something good on.

284
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:38,856

Guys...

334
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,361
I have been in a lot of bands in my life...

335
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:13,663
high school punk bands, college alt bands,

336
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:15,396
I was briefly a member of Five for Fighting

337
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:18,471
before they got big... and
I have never in my life,

338
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:22,291
felt the kind of spark... I did tonight.

339
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:23,142
What are you saying?

340
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:25,347
I'm saying I think we should
let Sheila in the band.

00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,148
Oh. Get a hold of yourself, man!

342

348

we stood for something.

349
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,029
We stood for not hanging out with our wives

350
00:13:46,073 --> 00:13:47,225
and taking back the night.

351
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:49,027

352
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:50,829

355
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:56,585

356
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:58,988

357

Well...

360
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,646
then you do it alone.

361
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:09,467
My friend,

362
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:11,133

381
00:15:01,852 --> 00:15:05,161
Yeah, I kinda liberated the
girls from their servitude

382
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:07,445

they're out there pursuing
their own interests.

426

You started your little
band with your little friends

so you could avoid doing
fun printing jobs with me.

446
00:17:47,122 --> 00:17:51,602
Look, Dallas, now I... I know you
want me to be rich and powerful

447

and to grow my business
into some huge empire,

448
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,865

you were coming at me so
hard with those flyers.

460
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:21,032

on something she really doesn't need,

466
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,915
she tries to cram it down
everyone else's throats

467
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:35,380
to justify the purchase.

468
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:37,299
Surely you can understand that.

469
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,683
Well, I'm sorry, Dallas.

470
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:41,141
I... I guess I was being a little defensive

471
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:43,575
because Steven was such...

472
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:46,885
An absolute skid mark on the
pristine panties of my soul?

473
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,679

474
00:18:47,704 --> 00:18:50,063
No matter how much money that man had,

475
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:52,071
it wasn't enough to keep me.

a $7,000 printer who could help?
