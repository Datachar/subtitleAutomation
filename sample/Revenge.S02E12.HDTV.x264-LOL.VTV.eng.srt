00:00:01,998 --> 00:00:03,638
<i>Previously on Revenge...</i>

2
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:06,131
Mr. Grayson here made some kind
of deal with the court.

3
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:10,020
Helping you would be beneficial
towards restoring his public profile.

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:12,521
Daniel's adding a new feather
in the company cap.

5
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,088
Stonehaven United.

6
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:17,259
- Nolan Ross is hiding the Carrion program.
- We're counting on you.

7
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:19,244
Helen Crowley
made contact with me,

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,947
- told me that my sister's still alive.
- Then we need to draw her out.

9
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:24,970
(Gasps)
(Gunfire)

10
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:27,569
- Who were those guys?
- I have my suspicions.

11
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:31,890
- <i>Brava.</i>
- Now let's see if she buys it.

12
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:38,618
<i>(Emily) Every human is born
of collusion.</i>

13
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:46,599
<i>We come into this world
the result of a covenant.</i>

14
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:55,158
<i>Sometimes made of love...</i>

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,966
<i>Sometimes of circumstance...</i>

16
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:19,998
<i>But almost always
made in secret.</i>

17
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,568
(Newspaper rustles)

18
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,677
I have to assume that you're reading
that rag at that decibel for my benefit.

19
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:40,666
What in this house
isn't for your benefit, dear?

20
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,253
Though I did catch wind of some news
that I'm sure will interest you.

21
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,774
Jason Prosser is vying
for Stonehaven United.

22
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,256
Now that's a lead
from the Initiative

23
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,825
you were once
in sole possession of.

24
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,377
Well, what are you implying,
Conrad?

25
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:54,945
That you're trying
to subvert the deal

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,597
to prove Daniel's
incompetency to Helen.

27
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:58,432
Don't get me wrong.
I approve of the plan.

28
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,713
Just not with your visibility.

29
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:04,951
I've had my communications director
assemble a Montauk dossier.

30
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:07,558
As I go forward with my plans
to clean up the docks,

31
00:02:07,592 --> 00:02:11,445
I expect you by my side
as the wife you've recommitted to be.

32
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,397
So you're still using
Amanda Clarke's hardships

33
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:14,732
to feed your delusions

34
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,329
of one day occupying
the governor's mansion?

35
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:18,736
Morning, all.

36
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,983
Darling, Happy Birthday.

37
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,775
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Just don't spend it all in ten places.

38
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:27,155
Sweetheart. Oh.

39
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,991
Is it possible that I have
a 24 and 18-year-old?

40
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,371
- Where does time go?
- And where is Daniel?

41
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:34,623
Oh, believe it or not,
he's already in the office.

42
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:38,316
So driven that apparently
he forgot his little sister's big day.

43
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,502
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,404
Charlotte, would you
excuse us for a minute?

45
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:45,539
It seems that the cat
has dragged itself back in.

46
00:02:45,557 --> 00:02:48,543
- There's the report you requested.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:50,570
So this is the new
communications director?

48
00:02:50,593 --> 00:02:51,963
Don't you know that politicians

49
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:54,098
tend to keep their concubines
in the closet?

50
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:56,316
Spoken like a woman that
no one is sleeping with.

51
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:58,486
You'll be happy to hear
that Ms. Davenport and I

52
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,604
have put our past behind us,

53
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,439
and we are now
looking to the future.

54
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:05,099
Well, I can only imagine what kind
of horrifying footage that will yield.

55
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:14,178
You look like
the loneliest man in the world.

56
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:18,066
First I'm banned from Grayson Global,
now your house.

57
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,383
How long till our scheming

58
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:20,968
gets me banned
from the Hamptons entirely?

59
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:22,270
That's why I called.

60
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:24,322
I needed an honest moment.

61
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:26,074
I miss you.

62
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:33,875
Me, too.

63
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:35,360
As most of the time
I'm with you,

64
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:37,112
I'm resigned to playing
the jealous ex.

65
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,997
Well, you played it perfectly
last night.

66
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,983
Thank you.
(Chuckles)

67
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,964
How are you doing with it?

68
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:46,138
As well as a woman
leading on her ex-fiancé

69
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:49,370
can possibly feel
about herself.

70
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:52,341
He's taking me to lunch,
to a new oyster bar.

71
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,593
Oysters. Subtle.

72
00:03:55,617 --> 00:04:00,397
Hey, well, at least our
mission is on track.

73
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,395
Aiden, I know how hard
it must be,

74
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:06,076
waiting for a lead
on your sister,

75
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,049
but until they give you
proof that she's alive...

76
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,401
I can subsist on hope,

77
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:11,720
which is more than I've had
for the past decade.

78
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:15,908
So what's your next move?

79
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:18,710
Unfortunately, it's not mine.
It's Helen's.

80
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:20,715
She's holding all the cards.

81
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:25,046
Whatever happens,
we're gonna figure it out, okay?

82
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,931
I promise.

83
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:33,404
I know what you're up to.

84
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:37,708
You had the seller
stage this place

85
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:40,428
with all my favorite decor,
didn't you?

86
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:44,338
Anything to end
your never-ending house hunt.

87
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:45,883
You've hated
all the other places

88
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,585
for the most nit-picky reasons.

89
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:50,137
Well, we've only looked at...
twelve.

90
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,856
At an average of
20,000-square-foot per,

91
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,691
- which adds up to...
- A marathon.

92
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:59,196
I see your point,
and I think...

93
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,026
I do <i>love</i> this house.

94
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:04,691
Great!
I'll call the agent.

95
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:07,886
And this can be yours tomorrow.

96
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:11,583
Okay.
What's wrong now?

97
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:16,278
Well, the key...
it's a little... pedestrian.

98
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:20,516
Okay, 'kay, 'kay.
Well, nothing's perfect.

99
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,019
Except maybe you.

100
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:33,416
(Emily) I thought
we were going for lunch.

101
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:34,868
(Daniel) We are.

102
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,408
You love Kumamotos, right?

103
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:41,029
Well, they're only fresh
on the west coast,

104
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:43,593
and since the oysters
can't come to <i>us...</i>

105
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,573
No, I know
what you're gonna say...

106
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:46,975
we gotta take this slow.

107
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:49,232
But Stonehaven wants face time
with everyone in the running,

108
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,501
and I'm at my best
with you by my side.

109
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:54,879
Daniel...
(Sighs)

110
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:56,214
I can't just pick up and leave.

111
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:58,349
I didn't even bring
anything with me.

112
00:05:58,383 --> 00:05:59,484
Don't worry.
I packed you a bag.

113
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:01,618
I even bought you a couple
of new outfits for Los Angeles.

114
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:04,689
It's all on board.

115
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,000
Listen, Em...

116
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:09,988
You helped me land
Takeda Industries and Nolcorp.

117
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:11,571
But this is
my first real play as C.E.O.

118
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:13,940
Help me make it a trifecta.

119
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,325
Please.

120
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:20,962
Great.

121
00:06:20,996 --> 00:06:23,598
Now I promise,
this is a business trip.

122
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,967
All right?
We can take it as slow as you like.

123
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,152
Unless...

124
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:31,005
Easy, tiger.
Let's get Stonehaven first.

125
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,308
Then we'll decide
how to celebrate.

126
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,179
(Alarm chirps)

127
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,859
You could've just called.

128
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:47,328
That's so impersonal
after all we've been through.

129
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,763
And besides,
it's in my best interest

130
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:51,287
to keep the ball in my court.

131
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,938
I have my suspicions
you were behind

132
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:55,197
that little stunt
at the wine auction.

133
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:57,053
Oh, you flatter me.

134
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:59,539
If you recall,
they gassed us both.

135
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:02,934
A perfect cover for your partner
to run the interrogation.

136
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:05,611
You and Victoria Grayson
have much to gain

137
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:06,946
by working together...

138
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,642
You to save your sister,
she to save her son.

139
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:12,085
I assure you, I had no part
to play in our abduction,

140
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:14,020
nor would I ever collude
with that woman.

141
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:15,355
I work alone.

142
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:16,789
And until I see proof
of my sister's well-being,

143
00:07:16,824 --> 00:07:18,908
that's how it's going to stay.

144
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:21,444
(Beep)

145
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:22,929
<i>(Man) What's your name again,
darlin'?</i>

146
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:25,460
<i>Colleen.</i>

147
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:28,130
<i>That right?
You got a family somewhere?</i>

148
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:29,981
<i>I have a brother.</i>

149
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,870
What do I have to do?

150
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,222
Kill Victoria Grayson.

151
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:40,809
You have 24 hours.

152
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:53,398
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

153
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,636
(Conrad) Not only
do I appreciate your plight,

154
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,188
it may surprise you,
Mr. Porter,

155
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:09,425
but we have
a considerable amount in common.

156
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,282
We're both entrepreneurs,

157
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,751
both in
complicated relationships.

158
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,081
We took over
our father's businesses,

159
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:18,506
and we inherited their sins.

160
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,060
Clearing the drug charge won't
be a problem for my lawyers,

161
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,457
but murder...
(Sighs)

162
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,655
Jack didn't kill anybody.

163
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:25,262
We know, but we also know

164
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,697
that the gun used
to kill Joe Ryan

165
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:28,351
was registered to his father.

166
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,716
I thought that's why we were here,
so you could help us with that.

167
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,477
Or is it the other way around?

168
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:35,751
Are we just the poster children
for your new public image?

169
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:39,610
Oh, you mean do I have a
selfish motivation for this? You bet.

170
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,730
See, my daughter chooses
to spend her leisure time

171
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:44,098
in your
questionable establishment,

172
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:45,483
putting herself in harm's way.

173
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:47,985
It's a concern I'm sure
you share for your son Carl,

174
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:50,121
a child proudly named
after the man

175
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,407
whose legacy you're willing
to go to jail to uphold.

176
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:58,928
The shooter's name
is Matt Duncan.

177
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:00,596
The Ryan brothers put him
in the hospital

178
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:01,881
trying to get him to talk,
but he wouldn't break.

179
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,049
I'll get the authorities
on the line.

180
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,467
No, look, without Matt Duncan,

181
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,634
my dad would've lost
The Stowaway six years ago.

182
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:09,147
He protected us then.
I'm standing by him now.

183
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,742
(Conrad) Oh, I can see
we're both stubborn, too.

184
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:16,977
But unlike you, Mr. Porter,
I value self-preservation and the living.

185
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:18,865
I'm afraid
I'm unable to help you

186
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,366
if you're unwilling
to help yourself.

187
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,402
Feel free
to show yourselves out.

188
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:28,065
I knew this was a mistake.

189
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:31,602
The only mistake
being made here is yours.

190
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:35,607
Father's friend or not,
Matt Duncan is a murderer.

191
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,659
If you don't call him out,
Carl loses his dad,

192
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:40,746
and I lose my husband...

193
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:42,946
(Crying)
Assuming I even get to call you that

194
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:45,265
before they lock you up.

195
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,834
(Sobs)

196
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,263
(Woman)
After the Northridge Quake,

197
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:53,048
my father was inspired
to use the profits

198
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,567
from our military contracts

199
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:57,096
to create a privatized
disaster-relief firm.

200
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,764
Stonehaven and its employees
meant everything to my father.

201
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:02,453
And I'm not interested
in handing it over to someone

202
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,306
with plans to break it up
and sell it for parts.

203
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:06,973
Believe me,
that's not my intention at all.

204
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:09,820
Forgive me, but your company's
rather dubious reputation

205
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:12,485
doesn't offer much comfort.

206
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,553
Well, I think we can all agree

207
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:17,756
that Grayson Global needs its
own kind of disaster relief.

208
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,876
Why don't you mention what we
were talking about earlier?

209
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,813
Right. My goal is
to re-brand our image

210
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:25,548
so that the "global" refers
to world view,

211
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:27,333
not world domination.
(Chuckles)

212
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,104
Thank you for your candor.

213
00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:32,593
And I <i>can</i> tell you

214
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:34,478
that your bid is on top
of a very short list

215
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:36,096
of competing offers.

216
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:37,831
Well, thank you very much
for this opportunity,

217
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:39,149
Ms. Carlisle.
It's been a pleasure.

218
00:10:39,183 --> 00:10:41,518
- Lovely to meet you.
- You, too.

219
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:42,903
You see?

220
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:44,805
If it weren't for you,
I may have lost her just now.

221
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:46,323
Thanks for the assist.

222
00:10:46,357 --> 00:10:48,010
Well, we haven't won yet.

223
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:49,710
But it's looking up.

224
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:51,211
Should we head to the hotel?

225
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:57,992
(Objects rattle)

226
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:01,846
(Cell phone vibrating)

227
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:03,064
(Beep)
Yes.

228
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:04,232
The pieces of the puzzle

229
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:06,250
are beginning to come together,
Ms. Lahari.

230
00:11:06,268 --> 00:11:07,435
<i>All but yours.</i>

231
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,153
I'm doing everything I can.

232
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:10,472
<i>Remember what's at stake
for you</i>

233
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:13,092
<i>if you don't find
the Carrion program.</i>

234
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:14,726
Not a moment goes by
that I don't.

235
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,729
You're one of many irons
I have in the fire.

236
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:20,337
Don't give me a reason
to pull you out.

237
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,705
(Objects rattling)

238
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:33,094
Looking for... something?

239
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,147
Damn.

240
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:40,016
I was trying to hide this
so you'd find it later.

241
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,006
I can't do anything
about the pedestrian key,

242
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:46,108
but I can change
what you keep it on.

243
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:47,811
His name is Hanuman.

244
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:50,012
He's an avatar of Shiva

245
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:52,748
and a deity that wins
against demons and bad spirits.

246
00:11:52,782 --> 00:11:54,933
He'll keep you safe
in your new home.

247
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,530
You stopped listening at "avatar,"
didn't you?

248
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:04,884
I heard every word you said.

249
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,323
Thank you...

250
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,942
For always looking out for me.

251
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:21,331
(Amanda) Happy 18th, Charlotte.
(Laughs)

252
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:23,005
From your nephew.

253
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:27,293
Aw.
It's Carl's little handprint.

254
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:29,628
- It's so sweet.
- 18 is a big one.

255
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,031
You're independent, free.

256
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:33,633
In my case, I literally was,

257
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,402
since that was the year
I was released from juvie.

258
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:40,006
It was also the year
our dad died.

259
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,603
Yeah...

260
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:45,998
It was.

261
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:48,285
I wish I had known you then.

262
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:49,999
I can't imagine
what it was like

263
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:52,335
to lose the only family
you had.

264
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:56,689
Speaking of...

265
00:12:56,723 --> 00:12:57,940
Where's yours?

266
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:59,716
Daniel forgot.

267
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,751
My father is hopefully getting

268
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:03,486
the Ryan brothers
out of your hair,

269
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:06,723
and I'm meeting my mom
in the city tonight for the ballet.

270
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:08,241
It's kind of a tradition.

271
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:09,659
(Cell phone ringing)

272
00:13:09,677 --> 00:13:11,828
Speak of the devil.
(Beep)

273
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:14,481
So what's the program tonight?
I pray it's Balanchine.

274
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:16,449
(Victoria) Well,
that's just it, Charlotte.

275
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,390
Everything's okay,
but I had to leave town suddenly,

276
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:20,681
<i>and I won't be back
until tomorrow.</i>

277
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:22,116
<i>But I promise
to make it up to you.</i>

278
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,851
Are you serious?

279
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,486
You do know that I love you,
don't you?

280
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,493
- Yes.
- Good.

281
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,773
Then keep that
close to your heart

282
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:31,725
till I get back tomorrow.

283
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,352
(Beep)

284
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:38,134
What does it mean when your mom
cancels your birthday?

285
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:42,044
I'd say it's her gift to you.

286
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:45,781
I guess being a Grayson

287
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,533
just means learning to live
with disappointment.

288
00:13:48,735 --> 00:13:51,263
You're not a Grayson.

289
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,623
Not really.

290
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,134
Victoria?

291
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:02,029
(Laughs)
I'll get right on it.

292
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:03,616
Jason.

293
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,084
I am peeved with you.

294
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:06,218
It seems
that you've thrown your hat

295
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:07,827
to the Stonehaven ring.

296
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,409
Simply my compulsion
to leave no stone unturned.

297
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:12,962
Well, then as a major
shareholder of Grayson Global,

298
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:15,408
let me disabuse you
of your pessimistic outlook.

299
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:17,460
Aren't you still
my competition?

300
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:19,682
Business makes
for strange bedfellows.

301
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:21,472
My son,
though well-intentioned,

302
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:23,230
is not ready
for this acquisition.

303
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:25,209
So I'm here to protect
the family business.

304
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:28,185
There's something
you're not telling me.

305
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:32,161
Only that you would make an
excellent steward for Stonehaven.

306
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:33,824
(Chuckles)
And should that come to pass,

307
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:36,199
I hope you'll allow me
to thank you later.

308
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:39,201
As for now,
I have a meeting to get to.

309
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:46,363
Oh, you're not serious.

310
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:48,883
I can't believe you.
You crossed the country

311
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:50,426
to lure that rat
into helping you.

312
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:52,002
I just bumped into him.

313
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:53,337
- Oh.
- I'm here for you, Daniel.

314
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:55,239
Although I see that you
brought reinforcements.

315
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:56,824
Yeah, it's nice to have
someone's unconditional support.

316
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,932
Well, then allow me
to offer you mine.

317
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:00,436
Now if your intention

318
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:02,081
is to rehabilitate
Grayson Global's image,

319
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:03,142
I would encourage you

320
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:04,994
to not go through
with this acquisition.

321
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,879
Why, because I'll affirm
my standing as C.E.O.?

322
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,214
No, quite the opposite.

323
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:10,399
These disaster-relief companies
swim in dirty pools,

324
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,468
and Stonehaven is no exception.

325
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:14,370
They're not humanitarians.
They are profiteers.

326
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:16,002
Are you really trying
to take the moral high ground?

327
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:17,400
(Lowered voice)
Have you forgotten what you are,

328
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:18,832
what you've profited from?

329
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:21,471
I suggest you that you
do your research

330
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:23,223
- and find out why these people want you to...
- You want me to do <i>my</i> research?

331
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:24,691
You should probably go upstairs

332
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:27,978
before you say something
you regret in public.

333
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:33,761
- Think about it.
- Yeah.

334
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,685
I assume, per our agreement,
you're here to dissuade my son

335
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:38,628
from going through
with this acquisition?

336
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:40,413
You need to explain to me
exactly why

337
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,031
you are so set against it.

338
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:43,866
Did you not understand
a word I said?

339
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,052
This is not
in Daniel's best interest.

340
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:48,169
And unlike my son,
Prosser can hold his own.

341
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:49,620
Now he's sitting on the fence,

342
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:51,923
and I'm here to push him
in the right direction.

343
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:57,945
(Cell phone auto-dials)

344
00:15:57,979 --> 00:15:59,113
(Phone rings)

345
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:00,281

346
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:01,449
<i>(Aiden) There you are.</i>

347
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:02,750
Aiden,

348
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:04,619
listen, I don't have
a lot of time to explain,

349
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:07,321
but Daniel decided to
sweep me off to L.A.

350
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:08,721
to help him get Stonehaven.

351
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:10,374
<i>And I'm sure he thinks
you'll seal the deal</i>

352
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:13,511
<i>in that blue dress
you're wearing.</i>

353
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,496
<i>Behind you.</i>

354
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:18,933
(Beep)

355
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,326
What the hell
are you doing in L.A.?

356
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,477
Funny, I thought the same thing

357
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:30,712
when I saw you
in the lobby with Daniel.

358
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:32,664
You're saying
you didn't follow us?

359
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:33,882
While I'm not thrilled
your lunch date

360
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,668
turned into a change of time zones,
I do trust you, Emily.

361
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:39,584
Then what are you doing here?

362
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:42,888
Helen found me.

363
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:45,781
Our little ruse
at the auction worked.

364
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:47,509
She believes Victoria's
behind everything.

365
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:48,793
Now she wants proof
of her meddling

366
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:51,680
with the Initiative's plans.

367
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,513
How can I help?

368
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:55,033
Go back to New York.

369
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:56,618
If they believe you're
in league with Victoria,

370
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:58,598
it could have
dire consequences.

371
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:00,770
I can't leave, Aiden.

372
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:02,210
If Daniel loses Stonehaven,

373
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:03,670
we lose our link
to the Initiative.

374
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:06,414
Well, then our missions
are at odds.

375
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:10,869
(Sighs)
Maybe not.

376
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:12,737
Prosser knows
that I'm with Daniel,

377
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:15,106
so I can't dissuade him,
but maybe you can.

378
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:16,808
To what end?

379
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:19,738
Making Stonehaven
a sure thing for Daniel

380
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:23,242
forces Victoria
to expose her true intent.

381
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,277
And if I'm successful,

382
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,812
you'll go?

383
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:29,348
I'll have no reason to stay.

384
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:39,393
They release you?

385
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,882
Oh, hey.

386
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,474
No, uh...
Insurance ran out,

387
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,203
so I figure I'd give my girls

388
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:48,006
a chance to take care
of the old man.

389
00:17:48,638 --> 00:17:50,839
How you doing, Jack?

390
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,193
Not so good.

391
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:57,563
The Ryans framed me
with a drug charge.

392
00:17:57,597 --> 00:17:58,647
I was arrested,

393
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:01,002
and the police
found a gun on my boat.

394
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:02,468
And since
it's a murder weapon...

395
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:04,370
I told you
to stay away from them.

396
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:06,038
You should've listened.

397
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:08,073
That's not gonna change
the past, Matt.

398
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:09,491
They're gonna pin
Joe Ryan's murder on me.

399
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:11,343
Do you understand that?
The one that <i>you're</i> guilty of.

400
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:13,462
And you want me to confess?

401
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:15,608
I know this still weighs
on your conscience,

402
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:17,076
or you wouldn't have told me
you did it.

403
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:18,361
You don't know what it's like

404
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:19,979
to have someone
hurt your child.

405
00:18:20,343 --> 00:18:22,861
And, yeah, it weighs on me.

406
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,030
But I learned to live with it.

407
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,971
Wish I could say the same
for my dad.

408
00:18:29,994 --> 00:18:31,653
You heard about
what happened, right?

409
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:34,022
Heart attack at 52.

410
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:36,358
My kid never got a chance
to meet him.

411
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,560
You want him growing up
without a father, too?

412
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:43,808
- Another copy of my room key, please.
- Okay.

413
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:45,593
Always the sign
of a good visit.

414
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,421
Now you already know this,

415
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:51,280
but that <i>Forbes</i> cover
did you no favors.

416
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:53,655
Airbrushes
are for super models.

417
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:54,906
Last thing I need

418
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,591
is for people believing
I've gone soft.

419
00:18:56,614 --> 00:18:58,459
The man who shorted
the sub-prime collapse?

420
00:18:58,494 --> 00:18:59,610
No chance.

421
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:01,045
So, uh,
what brings you to L.A.?

422
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,797
You know who I am.
What do you think?

423
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:04,929
That you're here
for Stonehaven.

424
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:08,720
My boss has a significant interest
in Grayson Global.

425
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:10,330
He sent me
to monitor negotiations.

426
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:11,763
Right. Satoshi Takeda.

427
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:13,198
I recognize you
from the wine auction.

428
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,634
Mm-hmm. I...
I did read the <i>Forbes</i> piece

429
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:17,336
about your passion
to acquire businesses

430
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,437
that are good for the soul.

431
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:21,083
Is... is that for real?

432
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:23,317
It's my new philosophy, yes.

433
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:26,737
Well, then there's something
you need to know.

434
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,178
A friend at the D.O.J.
informed me

435
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:31,797
that Donna Carlisle is looking
to dump her father's company

436
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:33,799
in advance of an indictment,

437
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,884
and the lucky winner
inherits the lawsuit.

438
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:37,453
Why are you telling me this?

439
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:39,414
Professional respect...

440
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:40,932
And for <i>my</i> soul.

441
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:43,142
But look on the bright side.

442
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:45,577
More time to spend with
whoever's getting that key.

443
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,284
(Beeps)

444
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:57,659
Get me Donna Carlisle.
It's Jason Prosser.

445
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:04,890
I'll have your oldest scotch.

446
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:07,476
Neat.

447
00:20:07,494 --> 00:20:09,428
You have my father's tastes.

448
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:13,282
And your father would've been
Joe Ryan, correct?

449
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,335
Yeah, his name came up
when I was at the Montauk P.D.,

450
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,006
helping to clear your partner's
bogus drug charges.

451
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:22,869
Hey, does the name
Matthew Duncan ring a bell?

452
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,926
In this envelope
is Mr. Duncan's confession

453
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,161
to your father's murder.

454
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:37,150
I'm gonna make this...
(Whispers) very easy for you.

455
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,621
(Normal voice)
There's $50,000 for your signature

456
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,489
and a swift departure.

457
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:43,653
Oh, come on.

458
00:20:43,672 --> 00:20:46,023
Haven't you put
these boys through enough?

459
00:20:50,562 --> 00:20:52,195
(Knock on door)

460
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:55,739
Hi.

461
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:56,784
Victoria.

462
00:20:56,818 --> 00:20:59,687
I wanted to find out
how the meeting went.

463
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,240
And I see I have my answer.

464
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,142
Were you planning on leaving
without saying good-bye?

465
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:06,301
It seemed consistent

466
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:08,920
with your aversion
to open communication.

467
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,118
Some guy in the lobby

468
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:13,670
told me about Stonehaven's
pending lawsuit.

469
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,740
- Well, then you were lied to.
- Over and over, it seems,

470
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:18,809
starting with the moment
you began priming me

471
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:21,459
for this sour deal
in the first place.

472
00:21:21,484 --> 00:21:24,746
- I'm no one's rube, Victoria.
- No, you're not.

473
00:21:24,771 --> 00:21:27,451
You've always had a strength
and clarity of purpose

474
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:28,885
that I admired
from the first day we met.

475
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:33,991
And I remember the night...

476
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:35,909
Conrad parading you
around that party

477
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:39,112
at the governor's mansion
like he owned you.

478
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,286
But you're no one's possession,
are you?

479
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:44,476
No.

480
00:21:44,497 --> 00:21:46,913
Least of all Conrad's.

481
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,450
The next morning,

482
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:50,952
the David Clarke scandal broke.

483
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:53,755
That's right.

484
00:22:00,075 --> 00:22:03,498
David made himself vulnerable
to the wrong people.

485
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:06,601
The same people who are about
to take hold of my son.

486
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:09,004
Unless?

487
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:10,655
Unless you win Stonehaven.

488
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,127
Jason, please.
I beg of you.

489
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:18,964
I don't want Stonehaven.

490
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:21,016
What I want is you.

491
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,718
But you've known that
all along.

492
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:27,556
(Clicks)

493
00:22:30,554 --> 00:22:32,144
Do what I ask...

494
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:35,313
And I'm yours.

495
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:55,031
(Keypad clicking)

496
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:57,466
(Chimes)

497
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:02,305
- Hey.
- Hey.

498
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,340
I'm so glad Prosser bowed out.

499
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:07,207
Finally gives us a chance
to relax.

500
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:09,278
Well, we always did
make a good team.

501
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,330
And this time I promise
to appreciate it.

502
00:23:12,295 --> 00:23:14,089
I don't want to lose you again.

503
00:23:14,123 --> 00:23:15,140
Daniel, please...

504
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:16,851
No, no, whatever it was,

505
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,310
I'm... I'm not
that guy anymore.

506
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:19,995
I'm just happy that

507
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:21,963
you're giving me a chance
to prove it to you.

508
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:26,517
What's in the bag?

509
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:29,253
Oh, it's a present
for Charlotte.

510
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:30,471
For her birthday.

511
00:23:31,092 --> 00:23:33,877
Oh, my God.
I completely forgot.

512
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:36,379
Well, it can be
from both of us.

513
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:39,199
- To teamwork.
- Teamwork.

514
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,985
(Cell phone rings)

515
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,469
(Ring, beep)

516
00:23:43,493 --> 00:23:46,456
Hey, Donna.
Come to a decision yet?

517
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:50,852
Right.

518
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:52,403
No, no. Yeah. No.
I understand.

519
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:54,635
Yeah, best to be cautious.

520
00:23:54,658 --> 00:23:57,158
No, we'll see you at 8:00.
All right.

521
00:23:57,192 --> 00:23:58,426
(Beep)

522
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,211
Prosser's back in the game.

523
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:01,345
What?

524
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,630
I'm sure my mother did
whatever she could

525
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:04,632
to keep him
wrapped around her talon.

526
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:07,752
Carlisle wants to hear final pitches
side by side tonight,

527
00:24:07,786 --> 00:24:09,993
only I've already
said my piece.

528
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:11,508
About Stonehaven.

529
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:14,678
But not about your competition.

530
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:15,863
(Rings)

531
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:17,297
(Sighs)

532
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,334
(Ring)

533
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:22,236
(Ring)

534
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,370
(Beeps)

535
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,956
Hey, big honcho.

536
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,245
Or is it head cheese?

537
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,209
Listen, Nolan, I need a favor.

538
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:32,935
I'm in L.A.
and under a time crunch.

539
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:34,532
You think you could do
a little digging for me

540
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,070
- on Jason Prosser?
- <i>Sure.</i>

541
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:38,971
Uh, question is, why would I?

542
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:41,532
Because you're my employee.

543
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:44,418
And your friend Ms. Thorne
suggested you...

544
00:24:44,453 --> 00:24:47,738
Might be able to access
the inaccessible.

545
00:24:47,772 --> 00:24:48,956
Did she now?

546
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:54,790
- I'll get right on it.
- Thank you.

547
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56,292
<i>Please stay on the line.</i>

548
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:59,278
Your call is very important to us.

549
00:24:59,313 --> 00:25:02,131
(Clicking)

550
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:03,232
(Chimes)

551
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:06,869
(Mouths words)

552
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,961
You sold our stake in the bar?

553
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:16,395
What the hell
were you thinking?

554
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:17,897
That it's time
to put this to bed.

555
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:20,016
Matt Duncan confessed.
That's what we wanted.

556
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,559
That's not what Dad wanted, Ken.

557
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:25,206
He made plans for us,
which the Porters

558
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,078
and the rest of these bottom-feeders
on these docks cut short.

559
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:29,593
Trying to turn these docks

560
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,644
into anything more
than what they already are

561
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,113
is a waste of time,

562
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:34,565
especially now that they've got
Conrad Grayson on their side.

563
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,500
Conrad Grayson
is a businessman.

564
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,720
And I'm gonna convince him
to sell The Stowaway back to us.

565
00:25:39,754 --> 00:25:42,201
I'm gonna make Dad proud, okay?

566
00:25:42,216 --> 00:25:44,350
With or without your help.

567
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:51,123
And simply put,
my goal is for Stonehaven

568
00:25:51,157 --> 00:25:54,209
to continue on
the same path ideologically.

569
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:56,180
That is exactly my hope.

570
00:25:56,194 --> 00:25:58,145
Personally,
I admire your mission

571
00:25:58,179 --> 00:25:59,579
to protect
your father's legacy.

572
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:02,366
My dad was a good man,
and not just to his own kids,

573
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,731
to any child,
especially disaster victims.

574
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:09,758
He'd see their faces and how terrified
and innocent they were...

575
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:13,340
I was living in Bushwick
during the blackout of '77.

576
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,160
I thought the world was ending.

577
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:18,733
My father's camera store was looted,
burned to the ground.

578
00:26:18,757 --> 00:26:19,626
Really?

579
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,683
You know, my father helped
to rehabilitate that whole borough.

580
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:26,135
You were probably one of
the kids who inspired him.

581
00:26:26,158 --> 00:26:29,294
Well, then I have a personal
obligation to repay him.

582
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:32,400
I'd like to raise my offer
if you'll consider it.

583
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:34,959
Well, as moving as your story
about the blackout is,

584
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:39,137
Ms. Carlisle wishes to uphold
her father's mantle, not destroy it.

585
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:40,796
Perhaps you'd like
to explain to her

586
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,931
how you colluded

587
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:44,621
to inflate gas and oil prices
after 9/11?

588
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,213
I was never involved
in those transactions.

589
00:26:47,236 --> 00:26:48,775
But your subsidiaries were.

590
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:51,158
In my short time as C.E.O.,
I've learned

591
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,363
I'm not only accountable
for my own actions,

592
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:54,781
but for those of everyone
working under me.

593
00:26:54,832 --> 00:26:56,550
Why is none of this
public record?

594
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:58,535
Well, because the lawsuits
were all settled and buried.

595
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,671
That's a fine allegation
coming from a Grayson.

596
00:27:00,705 --> 00:27:02,906
Oh, don't confuse my record
with my father's. All right?

597
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:04,508
Listen, Donna,

598
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,343
I never knew your father,
but I assume

599
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:08,745
he'd be greatly disappointed
if one of the children he helped

600
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,978
now helps to destroy
what he created.

601
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,931
Yes, he would be...

602
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,317
As am I.

603
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,988
(Chuckles)

604
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:26,567
I'll have my lawyers
draw up the contract,

605
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:28,018
and we'll go from there.

606
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:29,486
(Cell phone ringing)

607
00:27:29,537 --> 00:27:31,653
I'll leave you two
to talk details.

608
00:27:31,677 --> 00:27:33,056
Excuse me.

609
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:35,442
(Ring)

610
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:37,611
(Ring, beep)

611
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:38,962
Hello.

612
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:41,498
Uh, as requested,
I hacked Aiden's phone.

613
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:44,896
I'm sending you the file
he just received

614
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,737
from Helen Crowley.

615
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:50,190
<i>Ems, they've got his sister.</i>
(Cell phone chimes and beeps)

616
00:27:50,224 --> 00:27:52,242
<i>(Man) So, uh, where are
you from, Colleen?</i>

617
00:27:52,293 --> 00:27:54,261
<i>You ask too many questions.</i>

618
00:27:54,295 --> 00:27:56,713
<i>Our time's almost up.</i>

619
00:27:56,748 --> 00:27:59,685
<i>You're right.
Let's, uh, kick things up a notch.</i>

620
00:28:01,085 --> 00:28:02,786
<i>Try it.
You'll like it.</i>

621
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,589
<i>Like you said,
time's running out.</i>

622
00:28:09,494 --> 00:28:12,293
(Exhales)

623
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,331
Why the hell wouldn't Aiden
tell me about this?

624
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:15,832
Well, perhaps
it has something to do

625
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:19,252
with the subject line...
"A life for a life"?

626
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:22,172
<i>We know he's trying
to save his sister, but...</i>

627
00:28:22,206 --> 00:28:23,590
Who's the target?

628
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:26,876
Victoria.

629
00:28:27,948 --> 00:28:30,614
Track his phone
before it's too late.

630
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:40,078
Jason.

631
00:28:40,112 --> 00:28:41,663
You and your son
make an admirable team.

632
00:28:41,697 --> 00:28:42,897
You set me up,

633
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:44,432
and he and that woman
on his arm knock me down.

634
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:45,900
What are you talking about?
What happened?

635
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:47,415
Exactly what you knew
would happen.

636
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:48,635
Another Grayson victory.

637
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:50,053
Jason,
my son is in grave danger.

638
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:51,171
I swear that I have...

639
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:53,590
Whatever trouble he's in,
he deserves it.

640
00:28:53,624 --> 00:28:55,025
And you've earned
whatever heartbreak it brings.

641
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:56,643
What are you...

642
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:04,384
- Aiden!
- Damn it!

643
00:29:07,026 --> 00:29:08,526
Why didn't you tell me?

644
00:29:08,577 --> 00:29:09,711
And if I had?

645
00:29:09,745 --> 00:29:11,062
I know Victoria belongs to you.

646
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,977
I saw the video.

647
00:29:15,995 --> 00:29:18,530
I had Nolan
hack into your phone.

648
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:20,582
Is it really her?

649
00:29:20,616 --> 00:29:22,083
I'm certain of it.

650
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:28,171
Look, I know
what they're promising you,

651
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,531
but you can't let them
turn you into their assassin.

652
00:29:30,555 --> 00:29:32,592
If I don't, then I've failed her
for the second time.

653
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:34,923
And if you do,
then you give them all the power.

654
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:37,456
Listen to me, right now Daniel's
victory is their main concern,

655
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:38,591
and they have that.

656
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,177
You kill his mother,

657
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,862
you distract him
from their main purpose.

658
00:29:41,897 --> 00:29:43,898
Tell Helen that you realized this,
and instead,

659
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:45,649
you helped seal Daniel's
victory over Prosser.

660
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:50,604
Okay?

661
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,608
Look, I'm going back tonight.

662
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,660
You should, too.

663
00:29:58,504 --> 00:30:00,802
We're gonna find your sister.

664
00:30:00,826 --> 00:30:02,799
But on our own terms,
not theirs.

665
00:30:02,822 --> 00:30:04,307
And when we do,
we are gonna make them pay

666
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,714
for every second
they kept you apart.

667
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:07,548
Do you understand that?

668
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:24,403
Home again. Home again.

669
00:30:24,437 --> 00:30:26,172
(Sighs)
Yeah, we don't have to be, you know?

670
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:28,157
I mean, we can refuel the jet,

671
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:30,009
head to the Bahamas,
the Azores...

672
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:32,361
anywhere without business
or my mother.

673
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:35,147
I think I just want my own bed.

674
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:40,938
But, you know, maybe we can
plan another trip sometime soon.

675
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,813
(Padma) Just got your e-mail.
Bidding on the house?

676
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,549
Did you know that there was
a secret passage?

677
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:55,169
Because I am totally hosting
a murder-mystery dinner.

678
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:56,937
That's what finally
got you to commit,

679
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,305
a secret passage?

680
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,891
Mm, and, uh...

681
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:03,277
Someone
to walk through it with?

682
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:06,013
I don't know, Nolan.

683
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:08,220
After everything with Marco...

684
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,917
Hey, my feelings
for Groucho Snarx

685
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:14,099
were fleeting and...

686
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:15,832
And a mistake.

687
00:31:15,866 --> 00:31:19,402
I mean, he was only after one thing,
and it wasn't me.

688
00:31:19,437 --> 00:31:21,021
Just...

689
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:23,607
Some dusty
old computer program.

690
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:24,941
You mean Carrion?

691
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,504
Right.

692
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,858
(Knock on door)

693
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:44,169
Victoria.

694
00:31:44,192 --> 00:31:45,671
How was your flight back?

695
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:47,523
You know, you and I
could stand here all day

696
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:50,861
trading barbs and nettling
each other's last nerves,

697
00:31:50,882 --> 00:31:53,033
or we can cut the crap.

698
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:55,936
Why did you accompany my son
to California?

699
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,854
Because he asked me to.

700
00:31:57,889 --> 00:31:59,823
And I thought I could sway him.

701
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:01,792
Yes, but in which direction?

702
00:32:01,826 --> 00:32:03,443
I was forced to walk
a fine line

703
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:04,861
between my allegiance to you

704
00:32:04,912 --> 00:32:06,830
and my relationship
with Daniel.

705
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:08,398
Surely you could understand,

706
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:10,100
seeing as you've just done
the same with Prosser.

707
00:32:10,134 --> 00:32:11,568
Well, the difference is

708
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:13,987
that my son floats through life
on crests of women,

709
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:16,440
unable to make
his own decisions.

710
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,485
You could've dissuaded him at any point.
Why didn't you?

711
00:32:21,822 --> 00:32:24,640
I guess I wanted
to see him win.

712
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:28,460
You selfish little girl.

713
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,731
In doing so, you may have
caused him his greatest loss.

714
00:32:46,652 --> 00:32:48,086
(Emily) Nolan?

715
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:50,973
(Nolan) Welcome back.

716
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:53,525
I read about
how the west was won.

717
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,995
I hope I helped the cause
with your <i>faux beau</i>.

718
00:32:58,214 --> 00:33:01,383
I think I'm gaining
his confidence back.

719
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:04,319
But I might be
losing Victoria's.

720
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,774
It's only a matter of time

721
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:07,380
before she poisons me
to Daniel.

722
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,795
Well, not if you
poison her first,

723
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:12,497
which is a far more fitting end
than a bullet,

724
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,293
don't you think?
Speaking of which,

725
00:33:15,317 --> 00:33:17,235
have you heard
from Thomas Crown?

726
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:22,157
Well, I've tried
triangulating his phone.

727
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:24,326
He's either jammed it
or dumped it.

728
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,378
I just hope
I made the right decision.

729
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,668
I know I didn't.

730
00:33:32,538 --> 00:33:34,239
With the house?

731
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:37,342
Isn't this the one
that I'm buying you?

732
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:39,194
I don't think so.

733
00:33:41,214 --> 00:33:46,100
It seems nothing
can save me from evil spirits.

734
00:33:48,878 --> 00:33:50,359
Eleven years ago,

735
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:51,828
I started working on something.

736
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:54,450
Have I told you
what Carrion is?

737
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:56,064
Rotting meat?

738
00:33:56,098 --> 00:33:57,815
Mm, in the form
of a million lines

739
00:33:57,833 --> 00:34:00,718
of binary brilliance that...

740
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,321
have the ability to knock
Manhattan off the power grid

741
00:34:03,355 --> 00:34:05,356
in less than a millisecond.

742
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:06,975
(Sighs)

743
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:09,421
That's what Marco
was looking for.

744
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:11,123
Right program,

745
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:14,210
wrong C.F.O.

746
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:19,059
Last week, Padma referred
to Carrion as a person.

747
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:23,112
And today
she called it a program.

748
00:34:23,147 --> 00:34:24,647
I never told her that.

749
00:34:24,681 --> 00:34:26,749
I'm sorry, Nolan.

750
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:31,154
- Did she get her hands on it?
- No.

751
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:33,871
And even if she had,
it's unfinished.

752
00:34:33,883 --> 00:34:36,675
I keep the final sequence
locked up in here.

753
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:39,111
The timing
can't be a coincidence.

754
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:40,413
Padma played
an instrumental role

755
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:43,496
in acquiring Nolcorp
while seeking out Carrion,

756
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,180
and now Daniel's latest purchase
is a disaster recovery firm?

757
00:34:47,203 --> 00:34:49,454
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

758
00:34:50,095 --> 00:34:52,540
<i>That's</i> the Initiative's
master plan,

759
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,342
turning out the lights?

760
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:58,296
What concerns me
is what happens when they do.

761
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,667
What's your plan for Padma?

762
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,337
I don't know yet.

763
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,439
My advice?

764
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:11,392
Play her
like she's playing you.

765
00:35:22,531 --> 00:35:24,883
Dad?

766
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:26,618
Mom?

767
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:28,670
<i>Bon anniversaire, ma belle.</i>

768
00:35:28,704 --> 00:35:29,804
Ohh.

769
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:30,939
I thought you canceled
my birthday.

770
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:32,472
- Never.
- (Daniel) We rescheduled it.

771
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:33,707
We're celebrating you,
sweetheart,

772
00:35:33,741 --> 00:35:35,024
not the Gregorian calendar.

773
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:37,004
Go on.
Blow out the candles.

774
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:38,945
I only have one wish this year.

775
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:40,797
Anything.

776
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:44,083
I have spent the last two days
thinking about family

777
00:35:44,118 --> 00:35:45,652
and what it means
to be a daughter,

778
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,520
a sister, and now an adult.

779
00:35:47,555 --> 00:35:49,322
And my only wish

780
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:53,111
is that you support
my first adult decision.

781
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:55,622
I'm changing my name.

782
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:58,733
I filed papers
at the courthouse today.

783
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,812
You can now call me
Charlotte Clarke.

784
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,091
Happy Birthday, Charlotte.

785
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,576
From me and Daniel.

786
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:13,845
Emily.

787
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:16,481
Well, I didn't realize
we'd extended invitations.

788
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:18,087
Emily doesn't need one.

789
00:36:18,111 --> 00:36:20,952
Let's get you a drink.
Love you, sis.

790
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:31,488
I hope I didn't interrupt
your time with your family.

791
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,373
Trust me,
I didn't want to be around

792
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,642
for the aftermath
of Charlotte's announcement.

793
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:39,730
I can't imagine what hell
my dad's giving her right now.

794
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,213
Is everything all right?

795
00:36:50,482 --> 00:36:52,083
Oh, I can't do this.

796
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:57,722
I'm sorry.
I need to be honest with you.

797
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:01,559
A few weeks ago,

798
00:37:01,593 --> 00:37:04,879
Victoria asked me
to rekindle our relationship.

799
00:37:04,913 --> 00:37:06,980
She wanted somebody
to keep an eye on you

800
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:10,540
during your transition at work.

801
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:12,655
I said yes.

802
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:16,056
So you're the one
who leaked Stonehaven to her.

803
00:37:16,077 --> 00:37:18,754
Which is why I fought so hard
to help you win it back.

804
00:37:18,766 --> 00:37:20,029
Believe it or not,

805
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:23,149
I thought I was doing it
for the right reasons.

806
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:27,159
You must think I'm an idiot.

807
00:37:27,193 --> 00:37:30,062
There isn't a single aspect
of my life

808
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:31,964
that my mother
hasn't meddled in.

809
00:37:34,938 --> 00:37:36,472
You knew?

810
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:39,725
I mean, I...
I strongly suspected.

811
00:37:40,252 --> 00:37:42,670
Her plans so rarely
break in my favor,

812
00:37:42,688 --> 00:37:46,111
I guess I just
stuck my head in the sand.

813
00:37:46,134 --> 00:37:48,393
In all fairness,
I guess I was using you

814
00:37:48,427 --> 00:37:51,446
as much as you were me.

815
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,649
I was curious to see how far
you were willing to go.

816
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,654
Well, now you know.

817
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:03,158
You think we'll ever get back

818
00:38:03,192 --> 00:38:05,043
to being the people
we once were?

819
00:38:08,377 --> 00:38:09,878
Maybe.

820
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:14,845
Just not tonight.

821
00:38:20,184 --> 00:38:22,519
(Declan) Hey, can you just
tell me what you said to Matt?

822
00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:23,687
Honestly, not much.

823
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:25,038
He must have had
a crisis of conscience.

824
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:26,907
You did the right thing, Jack.

825
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:28,625
Daddy saved us.

826
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:31,094
I'm just glad Conrad
stood by his word.

827
00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:32,245
He got the drug charges dropped

828
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,197
- and banished the Ryans.
- Yeah, because now

829
00:38:34,232 --> 00:38:35,816
we're business partners
with Conrad Grayson.

830
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,167
I know. It's not ideal.

831
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:38,585
Ideal? The guy was stealing
money from his daughter

832
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:39,986
while she was locked up
in rehab.

833
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:41,171
Enough, Declan.

834
00:38:41,205 --> 00:38:43,576
I'm instating a ban
on all complaining,

835
00:38:43,594 --> 00:38:45,344
frowning,
and negative attitude.

836
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:47,803
It's not good for any of us.

837
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,755
(Nate) I didn't sign off
on this deal.

838
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,257
Ink's already dry.

839
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,060
You're gonna have to take that
up with your brother, Kenneth.

840
00:38:59,094 --> 00:39:00,428
I'll buy it back.

841
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:01,796
$60,000.

842
00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:04,599
$65,000.

843
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,284
Let me save you
this embarrassing display.

844
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:08,569
Exclusive of
your six-year vendetta

845
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:09,871
against the wrong man,

846
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:12,831
I know why you think
you want The Stowaway.

847
00:39:12,854 --> 00:39:16,072
I have been approached
by investors for decades

848
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:18,008
with plans
to develop the docks,

849
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:21,044
and each one has resulted
in the same conclusion...

850
00:39:21,078 --> 00:39:23,113
the owners have
very deep roots,

851
00:39:23,147 --> 00:39:24,814
and they aren't going anywhere.

852
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:27,981
You live in the castle
above the village.

853
00:39:28,015 --> 00:39:29,790
You don't know what I know,

854
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:32,690
what my father knew,
how these people work.

855
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:35,405
He almost had the waterfront
in the palm of his hand.

856
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,657
All we need is The Stowaway,
and we can regain

857
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:39,576
that foothold that he once had.

858
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,465
By what, changing community opinion
with town hall meetings?

859
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:45,447
Nah. With muscle.

860
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:47,922
Applying the proper amount
of pressure,

861
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,573
I can have roulette wheels
spinning by Memorial Day.

862
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:51,943
Ah.

863
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:55,263
Overly arrogant and ambitious.

864
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:57,131
I like that.

865
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:58,416
Think about it.

866
00:39:58,467 --> 00:40:00,134
Think about all those jobs
you'll be creating.

867
00:40:00,169 --> 00:40:02,403
It's right in line
with your new public image.

868
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:04,322
Conrad, we should
talk about this.

869
00:40:04,356 --> 00:40:05,456
You're right.

870
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:08,009
We absolutely should
talk about this.

871
00:40:08,027 --> 00:40:10,213
Ashley, could you please
close the door?

872
00:40:15,984 --> 00:40:18,536
You don't always have to pay
for dinner, you know.

873
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,371
Well, chivalry isn't dead.

874
00:40:20,406 --> 00:40:22,546
It's just somewhere
in my office.

875
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:24,283
You said
it's your platinum card?

876
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:26,377
It's probably

877
00:40:26,412 --> 00:40:27,678
next to my computer somewhere.

878
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:30,948
Aah!

879
00:40:30,983 --> 00:40:32,583
(Inhales sharply)
Ooh.

880
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:35,269
I forgot to warn you
about that trick drawer.

881
00:40:35,304 --> 00:40:37,121
Don't worry.
I'll clean it up.

882
00:40:37,156 --> 00:40:40,408
I still don't see
your platinum card.

883
00:40:42,128 --> 00:40:44,358
It'll turn up.

884
00:40:44,383 --> 00:40:47,802
I guess it is
your turn to pay.

885
00:40:49,771 --> 00:40:51,238
Deal.

886
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:52,406
(Beeps)

887
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,953
(Rapid beeping)

888
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,169
Aiden, what happened?

889
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,788
- The Graysons could see you...
- I don't care.

890
00:41:30,928 --> 00:41:32,996
<i>(Coughs)</i>

891
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,781
<i>(Moans)</i>

892
00:41:34,815 --> 00:41:38,017
<i>(Labored breathing)</i>

893
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:42,047
<i>(Man) It's done.</i>

894
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:47,253
They made it look like
an overdose.

895
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:50,606
Aiden...

896
00:41:53,497 --> 00:41:55,978
Aiden, I'm so sorry.

897
00:41:58,014 --> 00:41:59,948
But you can't trust
these people.

898
00:42:01,448 --> 00:42:03,387
You can't trust this.

899
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:06,590
- Listen to me...
- <i>Listen</i> to you?

900
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,726
I did listen to you,

901
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,728
and that's exactly
how this happened.

902
00:42:11,255 --> 00:42:13,268
You made me believe that
they were manipulating me,

903
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:14,630
giving me false hope,

904
00:42:14,654 --> 00:42:17,644
when it's <i>you</i>
I shouldn't have trusted.

905
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,020
If there's a chance
that my sister's alive,

906
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,239
then I'm gonna find her.

907
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,458
- Aiden...
- And if she is dead...

908
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:26,994
Then this is on you.

909
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:29,046
Aiden.

910
00:42:29,837 --> 00:42:32,466
Aiden!

911
