00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:42,951
What are you doing back?
We can't go over this again.

2
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:45,753
Go home. Get some sleep.

3
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,186
Ugh!

00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:50,988

00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:06,268
It is so weird watching
your mother try to rebound.

8
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:09,738
Well, taking care of her
appearance is a good sign, actually.

9
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:12,273
She's flirting with
everything that moves.

10
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:14,875
Did she tell you why
Cavanaugh broke it off?

11
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,478
- No.
- I wish she'd talk about it.

12
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,614
Do you know the average woman ingests

13
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:21,716
7 pounds of lipstick over a lifetime?

14
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,453
Why do you insist on telling me
your disgusting fun facts over food?

15
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:26,587
It's coffee.

16
00:01:26,622 --> 00:01:28,623
- Hiya, doll!
- Hi!

17
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:30,058
[ groans ]
Hallo Detective.

18
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:32,960
Of all the knuckleheads
she's gonna flirt with ...

19
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:34,562
she has to flirt with
Lightning McQueen?

20
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:36,931
I thought his name was Detective Gibson.

21
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:39,733
I believe he's part of
the auto-theft task force.

22
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:41,936
That explains why he's so arrogant.

23
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,037
Watch this. Watch.

24
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:46,573
Gibson: If you were a car,
you'd be a '68 Dodge Charger ...

25
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:48,841
sleek styling, great street performance.

[ chuckles ]

27
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,012
Hey, Detective. I was, uh,
I was just telling your mother

28
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,515
about this, uh, '68 Dodge
Charger we recovered.

29
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,150
Really?

30
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,286
I thought you were about to
compliment her on her trunk space.

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,587
[ chuckles nervously ]
Jane!

32
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,788
Good morning, Lieutenant.

33
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,493
What's good about it?

34
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:11,130
Angela: So... Rich, I guess
you'll have your usual.

35
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,666
Angela, how can you know me so well?

Now she's trying to
make Cavanaugh jealous?

40
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,975
Jealousy can sometimes be
a sign of love or commitment.

41
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,111
It can also be a sign
that Lightning McQueen

42
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,679
is about to get his ass kicked.

43
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:31,016
- So, I'll be seeing you, beautiful.
- Okay. Bye, Rich.

44
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,418
- I will call you.
- Okay.

45
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,320
Hey, Mrs. Rizzoli, if
you're not too busy,

46
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:36,821
can I get some coffee over here?

47
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:39,123
Right away, Lieutenant.

48
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:43,727
- I can't watch any more.
- We have to do something.

49
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,296
What?
Hide all the plastic knives?

50
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:50,433
Vanilla.

51
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:54,236

Just who I was looking for.

52
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,938

- Uh, never mind.

54
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:03,209

Who do we have here?

55
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:05,912
Reuben, Dania, Trevor.

56
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:07,479
It's Dawg.

Oh. How do you do, Dawg?

58
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:11,916
Rondo, aren't we
a little old for playdates?

59

These are all my homies
from "off the street."

60
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:17,988
- Oh. The home for teenagers?
- I volunteer there.

61
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:19,923
- We're "Rondo's rejects."
- Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:21,189
Um...

63
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,924
Perhaps you'd consider
a less pejorative name.

64
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,358
Juveniles often identify with
the labels society gives them.

65
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:31,627
Oh, society didn't name them.
They named their own selves.

66
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:32,662
Hmm.

67
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:37,199
Um, a reject is a person or thing
dismissed as failing to meet standards ...

68
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:38,333
Maura.

69
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:41,302
"Pejorative" is a word that
expresses contempt or disapproval.

00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:46,606
Brought 'em by to meet my heroes...

Wow. So you guys want to be cops?

[ scoffs ]
No. No way.

73
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:51,943
They just need a little mentoring.

74
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:54,145
Maybe you could...
take 'em around a little?

75
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,381
I-I could be a mentor, too.
Does anybody like cooking?

Cooking!

00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:01,651
- Or science?
- Science!

78
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:07,856
Okay, Ma, why don't you
give them a doughnut,

79
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:09,358
and we'll let you be on your way?

80
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:10,592
Fine by me.

81
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,594

You know, now that I think about it,
we love to mentor here.

84
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:24,304
And we can find a boy Detective,
if that's what you'd prefer.

85
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:27,807
Detective Frost could be your mentor.

86
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:29,909
And Sergeant Korsak
could be your mentor.

I'd rather it be someone
with an advanced degree.

- Okay, I guess.

Come here!

- I need you to do something.
- You got a big case?

00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:54,066
You see those teenagers over there?

00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,936
Run their names ... make sure
they haven't killed anybody.

You mean the ones
standing 6 inches from Ma?

You probably shouldn't let
them out of your sight, either.

- Beer.

He's a microbrewer.
This is his test kitchen.

I think we just found what's
left of our murder weapon.

on the stick belonged to Jensen.

You think a sharpened stick
could do that kind of damage?

At least reject kids
don't play with dolls.

00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:42,796
Yes, and if you touch my "action
figure" again, I will break your face.

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,966
If I could observe an autopsy,
it'd count for extra credit.

172

Okay, fine.

- No, Dania, your parents got to ...
- It's legal. I'm emancipated.

- Hi.
- You're about to do the "y" incision?

188
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:36,016
Yes!
And do you know why the "y," Dania?

189

To facilitate the removal
of the breastplate.

- Go ahead. Do it.
- Uh... no.

Our release form doesn't

You said I could check out an autopsy.

I didn't say which part.

Okay, so, the first thing
that I do is examine the body.

Does your release form cover gloves?

196

Yes.

All right.
Do you notice anything?

His leg's a little swollen,

You're very observant.

200

You think it could be
deep-vein thrombosis?

201
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:10,417

who died from sitting in
one place for too long.

203
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:16,123
Better be careful, Maura.
I think we found your replacement.

Can I see the wound?

205
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:22,763
- What kind of weapon did that?
- I'm not sure.

206
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:27,101
But the ragged wound edges suggest
some kind of a barbed blade.

207
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:28,770
Detective, can you help
me turn him on his side?

208
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:29,805
Yeah, sure.

There's something lodged near T-8.

Looks like some kind of spear tip.

215
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:00,501
It looks like an iron krokspjot.

Aha! Just as I suspected ...
a crockpot.

217
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:08,341
Krokspjots like this
were used during the Viking era.

218
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:12,713
Oh. I think these are rune
letters carved into the metal.

219
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:16,517
The runic alphabet is an ancient
nordic one that predates latin.

220
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,118
Can you read what it says?

221
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:20,621
No. I'll have to
consult a Runic scholar.

Well, Greg Jensen sold
Viking-themed beer.

223

Ragnarok Riders is a motorcycle

Well, the motorcycle-club logo

Yeah, 'cause he couldn't sue

He's covering for me.

I put it back.

Dania, why would
you steal from me?

- The pleasure is mine.

Dr. Isles was about
to show me some letters

you all would like me to translate.

540

Yes.
I have some of the letters here.

When you said "old," I didn't realize

that you meant he and
Olaf went on Viking raids... together.

547
00:28:33,523 --> 00:28:35,591
He's hard of hearing,
but he can read lips.

548
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:39,162
These appear to be
written in proto-norse.

That's an indo-european
language spoken in Scandinavia.

550
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,533
It's thought to have evolved

551
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:47,337

dialect over the 1st century A.D.

Well, these are love letters
addressed to a Viking

by the name of Olaf the Boneless.

555
00:28:59,885 --> 00:29:04,054
No, that's ...
that's historically incorrect.

556
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:06,824
it's Ivar the Boneless.

557
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,695
Hmm.

00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:16,534
They were written by Olaf's lover,

562
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:26,076
Oh, dear. Olaf was still married
to a different Viking maiden

00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:28,079
by the name of Undirmaor.

- Not now, Maura.

It's from the same woman.

- Maura: Thank you, Susie.
- Okay, well, that's a big break.

Yep.

Nothing useful.
He just used it to play MMOS.

a successful business.

Kendra's cloak. No root ball.

675
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,427
But we are trying a new
forensic laser technique.

676
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:24,797
It uses ultraviolet light
and mass spectrometry.

677
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,799
- Faster, please.
- Zaps the hair and turns it into a gas.

678
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,968
Explain how that's gonna
help me solve two murders.

679
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,138
It may help us determine
what the killer ate

680
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,505
and drank over the last year.

681
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,842
How is knowing how many ding
dongs our suspect ate helpful?

682
00:35:36,877 --> 00:35:39,378
The mass spectrometer results
are back on the hair tests.

683
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:42,148
- I know you've been waiting for them.
- Thank you.

684
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:47,754
Because hair grows slowly over time,
it creates a timeline of sorts.

685
00:35:47,788 --> 00:35:50,791
Jane: Okay.
So, what did the killer eat ...

686
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:54,662
Uh, let me see ...
for breakfast in April?

687
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:57,265
- That's interesting.
- It certainly is.

688
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:01,670
Strawberry waffles?
Eggs benedict? What?

689
00:36:01,704 --> 00:36:05,240
Fermented minke whale
and sheep's head cheese.

690
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:09,712
Where would you get minke
whale and sheep's head cheese,

691
00:36:09,746 --> 00:36:11,280
assuming you'd want it?

692
00:36:11,314 --> 00:36:13,749
Um... Scandinavia?

693
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:19,723
Scandinavia.
Maura, what does "Undirmaor" mean?

694
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:22,292
- In english?
- No. In proto-hobbit.

695
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:25,496
- Yes, in english!
- "Underling" or "apprentice."

696
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,800
Apprentice.
Or assistant.

697
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:34,973
Maura, we know someone who's
probably been eating whale or sheep.

698
00:36:35,007 --> 00:36:37,609
Frost: Got a warrant.
Alibi was bullshit.

699
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:40,645
The airline just confirmed
Ruby Burke, Greg Jensen's assistant,

700
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,015
flew standby on an earlier
flight from Reykjavik.

701
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,618
- Nice, Frost.
- Okay. Thanks.

[ cellphone beeps ]

703
00:36:48,087 --> 00:36:49,554
Ruby didn't show up to work today.

704
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:51,723
She's playing
"Vikings of the realm" somewhere.

705
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:55,961
- So I put a bolo out in the realm?
- No. I built an avatar to find her.

706
00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:58,230
Looks just like you.

We got to go in disguise.

709
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,901
I still don't understand
the point of this stupid game.

710
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:05,736
Well, what is so hard about it?

711
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:11,542
You raid ships, plunder villages,
Kill sworn enemies... to win.

712
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:13,410
Win what? A fantasy lover?

713
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:17,281
Wait a minute.
I don't think this is about winning.

714
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:18,749
I think this is about love.

715
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:21,118
You think Greg Jensen was
having a real affair with Ruby?

716
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:24,054
I don't know.
It wasn't much of an affair.

717
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:26,290
There wasn't any evidence
of her at his love nest,

718
00:37:26,324 --> 00:37:30,127
and the secretions and the seminal fluid
that we found were a month old.

719
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:31,962
Unless Jensen had pity sex.

720
00:37:31,997 --> 00:37:34,765
- Pity sex?
- Yeah, one-time pity sex,

721
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:36,700
right before he sent
Ruby to Scandinavia.

722
00:37:36,735 --> 00:37:40,370
I mean, he froze her out ...
in real life and in the game, too.

723
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:42,406
So, Ruby must have
stalked him in the game,

724
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:44,575
figured out that he had
a new virtual lover...

725

Olaf? But Greg Jensen
is dead in the I.R.L.

728

So explain why Olaf is online
in his back bay love nest.

I loved him.

He loved me.

Did he love Ruby Burke,
or did he love Undirmaor?

He loved me.
Me.

748

Olaf loved Undirmaor,

oh, god, if only, if only
he knew that it was me ...

you were before or after

you slept with him a month ago?

I gave him my flesh.

was Undirmaor, he just...

Why? So you could study
