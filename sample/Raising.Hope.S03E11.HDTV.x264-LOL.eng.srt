00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,483
BARNEY:
<i>This year for Founder's Day,</i>

2
00:00:09,602 --> 00:00:10,606
we're going all out.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,807
I've rented an authentic
Western stallion

4
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:14,542
to give horsey rides in the parking lot.

5
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:16,114
You can thank my connection

6
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:17,499
at a Canadian meat company for that one.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,968
This will probably be
his last weekend, so don't

8
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:21,452
be stingy with the carrots.

9
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:22,620
Where were you?

10
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:25,056
I got a ticket taking Hope to day care.

11
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,424
I haven't been drinking, Officer.

12
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,059
And if you open up that door,

13
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,312
you'll see why I was driving so slow.

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,851
Oh, no, please don't write me a ticket.

15
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,487
Look, I have a van,
my fiancée has a moped.

16
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:40,188
And when I spend the night
at my fiancée's house,

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,472
I can't borrow my mom's car, and...

18
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,141
Look, I swear it's safe.

19
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,694
I get in accidents all the time.

20
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,579
Don't worry.
I figured out a way

21
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,498
to drive Hope that's even safer.

22
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:52,200
Does this involve the
text message you sent

23
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:55,987
asking me to fill a shopping
cart with marshmallows?

24
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:57,822
We got to buy a new car.

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,425
These vintage cash registers are going

26
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:02,260
to be a treat for the customers,

27
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,762
but a terrible burden for all of you.

28
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:06,164
They only go up to
nine dollars and 99 cents,

29
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:07,549
and they may be plated in lead,

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,051
so whatever you do, don't lick
your fingers after using them.

31
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:12,053
I'm talking to you, Frank.

32
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:16,674
Buy a car, huh?

33
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:18,026
It's just, it's a big decision.

34
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,344
But maybe you're right.

35
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:21,813
Maybe I need to man up and do it.

36
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:23,949
I'll talk to my parents
about it after work.

37
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,784
Jimmy, you are a
25-year-old man.

38
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,485
I think you're a little bit past

39
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,354
having to ask your parents'
permission to buy a car.

40
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:31,373
So you input the price,

41
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:33,691
you crank the handle,
and the drawer opens.

42
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:34,793
(bell dings)

43
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:37,078
Hmm. Must be stuck.

44
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:38,129
(grunts)

45
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,533
In sticking
with our Founder's Day theme,

46
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:44,702
I refuse to accept any modern medicine.

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,840
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go read the scripture

48
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:50,859
until the devil comes out of me.

49
00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:55,981
Look, I'll talk to my parents
about the car thing,

50
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,217
and if they say it's okay, I'll do it.

51
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:00,819
No biggie.

52
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,053
(sighs)

53
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,440
Hey, I know what you're thinking.

54
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,409
"Am I really getting married to a guy

55
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,361
"who has to ask Mommy
and Daddy's permission

56
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,779
to buy a car?"

57
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,247
That's not very sexy, is it?

58
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:16,067
FYI, I haven't talked to
my parents in seven years,

59
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:19,621
I'm a free-thinker,
and I can do 25 sit-ups...

60
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,172
throughout the course of a day.

61
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,606
I'm just putting it out there.

62
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:32,803
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

63
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,919
A new car?

64
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:37,606
New? Buying a
new car is nuts.

65
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,140
It borders on reckless.

66
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:43,612
But we need a new car,
and Sabrina said--

67
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:45,196
Sabrina says. Sabrina says.

68
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,065
Think for yourself, Jimmy.

69
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,267
And for God's sake, do as we say.

70
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:51,486
A new car is a complete waste of money.

71
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:52,937
They lose three-fourths
of their value

72
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:54,823
the minute you drive 'em off the lot.

73
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:55,824
That can't be true.

74
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,292
Doesn't matter, anyway.

75
00:02:57,326 --> 00:02:59,277
There's no way you guys have
enough money for a new car.

76
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:01,663
We don't need all the money.
We're gonna take out a loan.

77
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,715
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

78
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:05,783
Whoa. We don't take
out loans, Jimmy.

79
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,752
Credit is for chumps.

80
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:10,955
Credit is why this whole
country is in a deep repression.

81
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,890
BURT:
People went out,

82
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:13,058
and they borrowed more money

83
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,459
than they could afford.

84
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:16,594
Now their houses are either
under water or upside down.

85
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:19,130
While that sounds fun for
a weekend, it's no way to live.

86
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:21,966
Jimmy, what's the worst cartoon character?
Wimpy.

87
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,218
Right. Because
he always wanted

88
00:03:23,252 --> 00:03:24,969
to pay Tuesday for a hamburger today.

89
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,971
With a gut like that,

90
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,606
he should have been
eating the spinach anyway.

91
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,026
I bet he got gout, and that's
why they canceled the cartoon.

92
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,111
That's why your dad
and I always pay cash,

93
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:35,280
and we never buy anything new.

94
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:37,165
That way we always get
a much better deal.

95
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,533
I mean, look at this fridge.

96
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:39,984
We bought it used.

97
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:41,319
Freezer works too good.

98
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,157
There are tons of cars
in <i>The Natesville Courier.</i>

99
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:47,676
We'll go looking with you tomorrow.

100
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,711
And if Sabrina gives you a hard time,

101
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,797
just remind her that she had
a boyfriend when you met her.

102
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:54,349
<i>You</i> got <i>her</i> used.

103
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:56,167
BURT:
Hold on.

104
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,720
Think I got something.

105
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:02,691
Oh, it's your harmonica.

106
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:04,192
I thought it would be refreshing

107
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,728
to play a cold harmonica on a hot day.

108
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,730
(plays lively tune)

109
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,815
(laughs)

110
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,185
(muffled grunting, plays notes)

111
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:15,236
It's stuck on my lips!

112
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:16,371
(plays notes)

113
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:17,238
Don't pull!

114
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:18,456
Don't pull.

115
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,024
(Burt groans, notes play)

116
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,793
(muffled murmuring)
No, no, no. That's gonna hurt!

117
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:24,045
JIMMY: <i>So we started checking
</i> The Natesville Courier.

118
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,331
<i>After the ten pages of escort services,</i>

119
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:29,250
<i>there were listings for a dozen</i>
<i>old cars in our price range,</i>

120
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:31,386
<i>which was exactly $830 or under.</i>

121
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,922
What is with your guys'
irrational fear of credit?

122
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,256
Everybody uses it.

123
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:38,009
But if everybody jumped off a cliff, would you?
I would.

124
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:40,645
I wouldn't want to be the last
person left in the world.

125
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,880
I mean, it would be cool
to spend one night

126
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:43,982
in the White House and everything.

127
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,050
But after that, right off a cliff.

128
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:47,602
Now that we got
that major problem solved...

129
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,554
All I was trying to say is,

130
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:52,056
you're not going to find a lot
of decent cars for $830.

131
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:53,992
We're not looking
for a lot-- just one.

132
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:56,561
One diamond in the rough.

133
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,247
(yells)

134
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:01,065
Not a diamond.

135
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:04,452
I can't believe this is so cheap.

136
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:05,403
We'll take it.

137
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,422
(car alarm chirps)

138
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,959
(laughs)

139
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,076
Not a diamond.

140
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,244
Oh, come on!

141
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,779
It's just like the nursery rhyme.

142
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,247
I know another fairy tale.

143
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:18,967
We don't get it,
and we live happily ever after.

144
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,751
Not a diamond.

145
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,605
It's just as roomy as an SUV.

146
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,357
The poor guy would have lived
if he'd only worn his seat belt.

147
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,978
That reminds me--
this doesn't have seat belts.

148
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,813
Gomez, Morticia, Lurch,

149
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,097
I'm out of here.

150
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,265
If you're giving out nicknames,

151
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:35,933
<i>I'd</i> like a say in it.

152
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,703
I'm not selling it.

153
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:40,605
I just thought this would be a good way

154
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:41,823
to meet fellow Pacer fans.

155
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,374
Now that you're here,

156
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,959
you want to go get some pizza

157
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,828
and talk about how awesome my Pacer is?

158
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,996
BURT:
Whoa, look at this.

159
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,465
I think Sabrina left too soon.

160
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,121
That's our diamond.

161
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,090
But it's more than $830.

162
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:01,392
We'll just have to get creative.

163
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,062
I promise you're going to love this.

164
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:06,181
Ooh, this is exciting!

165
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,035
It's your mother's car.
Not anymore.

166
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,804
They gave it to us.

167
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:14,772
As a gift?
Well, sort of.

168
00:06:14,806 --> 00:06:17,108
You see, we finally found
the diamond in the rough,

169
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:19,244
but it was a bit
above my spending limit.

170
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,112
So my parents kicked in the extra money,

171
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:24,549
- and they gave us this car,
and they got their dream car. - Mm.

172
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,983
(tires squealing in distance)

173
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,002
♪

174
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:39,013
Is this amazing or what?

175
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,683
Roads? We don't need roads!

176
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:45,470
Please cover my eyes again.

177
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,527
See? This car's not so bad.

178
00:06:53,643 --> 00:06:56,011
And once you get a feel
for how to pump the brakes,

179
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:57,462
it's actually not that hard to stop.

180
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,847
Oh, yeah. That and the fact

181
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:00,932
that the radio shorts out
when the heater's on,

182
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:02,684
the hood pops up
when you brake too fast,

183
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:04,853
the power steering only works
on right turns.

184
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,738
(grunting)
And... not...

185
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:10,308
on... left... turns.

186
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:16,665
JIMMY:
Where are we?

187
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:18,256
SABRINA: At a place where
normal people buy cars.

188
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:21,320
Look, this car is no safer
for Hope than your van was.

189
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:24,640
Well...
Cars should not do this.

190
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:26,642
I'm pretty sure if you pull
that hard on any steering wheel,

191
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,648
it's gonna come off.
Let's find out.

192
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,642
It adjusts up and down,
controls the radio,

193
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:40,178
cruise control, Bluetooth and climate,

194
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,230
but it does not come off.

195
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:43,565
(grunting)

196
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,016
(panting)

197
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,267
Well, the seat's pretty comfortable.

198
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:48,269
Oh, wait-- it gets better.
Hold on.

199
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,437
Please be an ejector seat,

200
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:50,605
please be an ejector seat,
please be... Oh!

201
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:52,657
Oh, this is still cool.

202
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:55,076
Huh?
(laughs)

203
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:59,230
Heated seats are great, right?

204
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:01,983
My ass feels like
it just came out of a dryer.

205
00:08:02,017 --> 00:08:04,452
That kind of luxury cannot come cheap.

206
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:06,070
Just a few bucks more
on our monthly payment.

207
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:07,571
That's it?
Mm-hmm.

208
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:12,410
Your life is about to change, my friend.

209
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,432
Fresh air and sunshine,
anytime you want it,

210
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:19,017
for just pennies a day.

211
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:21,519
It just seems that if
there's an open roof...

212
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:23,137
There is no ejector seat, Jimmy.

213
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:27,725
Oh, I can't get enough of that.

214
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,427
It's called
"new car smell."

215
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:31,262
How much do they charge for that?

216
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,596
It's free.

217
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:34,198
Oh, we'll take it!

218
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:35,783
Congratulations.

219
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:37,435
You just chose the most reliable,

220
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:39,270
affordable, family car on the market.

221
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:41,789
Now let's go do some paperwork.

222
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:43,607
(sniffing)

223
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:45,209
How about I stay, sign the paperwork,

224
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:48,612
you pick up Hope, and I will
meet you at home with a new car?

225
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:52,550
Jimmy, this is the first new car
in Chance family history.

226
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:53,801
You should frame the title

227
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:55,619
and put it up next to your college di...

228
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:57,839
Next to your high school di...

229
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,590
Never mind.

230
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:01,342
I love you.

231
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:04,128
See you at home.

232
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:07,015
(inhaling)

233
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:10,134
VIRGINIA:
The engine on this thing

234
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:11,653
runs a little rough.

235
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:13,738
You really think it can get up to 88?

236
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:15,356
Only one way to find out.

237
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:16,941
(engine revving)

238
00:09:16,975 --> 00:09:19,527
If you really could go back
in time, what would you do?

239
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:21,362
Remember that time
we drove back from the lake...

240
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:22,380
Mm.
...and I said I could

241
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:23,531
make it all the way home

242
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:24,982
without stopping to go to the bathroom?

243
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
I'd stop.

244
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:27,618
I would go back in time

245
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:29,370
and not make chili
when we were up at the lake.

246
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:31,756
Here we go.

247
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,859
(engine revving)

248
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:42,133
(Burt laughs)

249
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,167
Sixty...

250
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:45,553
Sixty-five...

251
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:48,389
Seventy!

252
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:50,575
Seventy-three!

253
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:54,362
Seventy-eight!

254
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:55,396
(gasps)

255
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:56,781
Ow! Stop it, Burt!

256
00:09:56,815 --> 00:09:57,865
She's breaking up!

257
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,517
She's breaking up!

258
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,869
(screaming)

259
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:05,056
BURT:
Well, that was disappointing.

260
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,424
I mean, I'm not an idiot.

261
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,526
I know we don't have a flux capacitor,

262
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,194
but I thought,
if we could get it up to 88,

263
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:11,389
maybe something would happen.

264
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,231
It's probably best that it didn't.

265
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:15,266
Remember that movie
<i>The Butterfly Effect?</i>

266
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,053
We would have had to sit
through that stupid thing twice.

267
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:25,259
Put down the pen, Jimmy.

268
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,011
I just ran your credit.

269
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:29,063
You've got a score of 91.

270
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:31,065
Oh, that's an "A," right?

271
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,383
It's out of 850.

272
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:35,553
This is the worst credit score
we've ever seen.

273
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:38,072
It's the hardest my manager's
laughed since I showed her

274
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:40,742
that Internet video of guys
getting kicked in the jingles.

275
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:42,726
Have you seen that?

276
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:44,028
Oh, here, this'll cheer you up.

277
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:45,363
I don't understand.

278
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:46,864
I've never had a credit card.

279
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,282
I've never taken out a loan.

280
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,584
I've never even borrowed lunch money.

281
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:51,119
How can my credit be bad?

282
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,672
Well, according to this, in 1993,

283
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:56,124
you opened a credit card,

284
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:58,209
and made a bunch of charges
you never paid.

285
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:01,245
Do you remember signing
any documents as a kid?

286
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:04,849
Well, my mom used to make me
practice signing my autograph

287
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:07,101
in case I ever became a movie star.

288
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:08,853
You're my favorite movie star.

289
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:14,108
Can I have your autograph?

290
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:15,643
Okay.

291
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:17,228
Great.

292
00:11:17,262 --> 00:11:19,230
Sign here, here, and here.

293
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:20,898
Initials here and here.

294
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:22,773
And we're going to need
this one in triplicate.

295
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:24,168
No.

296
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:25,769
They wouldn't.

297
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:27,938
Says you owe six grand for a hot tub.

298
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:31,125
How can we afford a hot tub

299
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,244
and I can't get new shoes?

300
00:11:35,297 --> 00:11:37,498
Because your feet are gonna
keep growing, buddy,

301
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:39,167
but this hot tub will fit us forever.

302
00:11:39,218 --> 00:11:41,669
Now go to bed, and don't
forget to wipe your toes

303
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,004
before you go inside.

304
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:44,788
Ugh...

305
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:46,957
These debts are from over 20 years ago.

306
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:49,444
I'm sure creditors
must have been calling you.

307
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:51,846
(phone ringing)

308
00:11:51,897 --> 00:11:53,197
Hello?

309
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:56,017
This is Dennis Powers
from the Bank of Natesville.

310
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,302
I'm calling for James Chance.

311
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,405
Dad, it's that guy
who prank calls us again.

312
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,658
Let him have it, son.

313
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,943
Say hello to my butt.

314
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:06,994
(farting)

315
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:09,947
That's not funny or effective

316
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:11,815
since I can't smell it from here.

317
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:12,867
(farts)

318
00:12:12,918 --> 00:12:14,669
If you continue to mock me,

319
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:15,953
I'll freeze your credit.

320
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:16,987
(farting over phone)

321
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:18,989
(squirting sound)

322
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:20,291
Uh-oh.

323
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:22,326
I gambled and I lost!

324
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:26,848
Wow, that sounds traumatic.

325
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:29,833
Which makes it even harder to
ask for all this stuff back.

326
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:37,275
Virginia, I did it!

327
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:45,316
(makes whooshing sound
like DeLorean door opening)

328
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:47,869
We're a DeLorean house now.

329
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:49,987
Finally, people will be
pointing at our house

330
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,155
for all the right reasons.

331
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:52,323
(rattling doorknob)

332
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:54,208
Mom? Dad?

333
00:12:54,243 --> 00:12:55,526
Back up.

334
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:57,528
Just back up.
And be careful.

335
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:59,863
I already smacked the mailman's
chin pretty hard.

336
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:01,365
(whooshing)

337
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:02,866
DeLorean door.

338
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:05,303
Yeah, that won't get old.

339
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:08,139
I cannot believe what you guys
did to me when I was a kid.

340
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:09,757
I mean, you have done some awful things,

341
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:11,592
but this-- this has
to be the worst.

342
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:15,045
Oh, my God, he found out Maw Maw
performed his circumcision.

343
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:17,715
She learned how to do it during the war.

344
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:18,716
You barely cried.

345
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,434
You stole my identity!

346
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:22,720
What?
We would never do that.

347
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:24,888
You took out a credit card
in my name when I was five.

348
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:25,990
Oh, that.

349
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:27,408
Yeah, we did kind of do that.

350
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:29,193
But it wasn't our fault, Jimmy.

351
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:31,112
We had no idea how credit cards worked.

352
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:32,863
One day, your dad was at the bank

353
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:34,949
and they were handing out
these really cool fanny packs

354
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,450
if he signed up for a credit card.

355
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:38,286
It wasn't a lame one.
It was leather.

356
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:40,922
And when the credit card
showed up with his name on it,

357
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:42,406
we could buy all our dream stuff

358
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:44,258
from those late-night
infomercials.

359
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:46,127
Smokin' Joe Frazier Grill,

360
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:47,428
Andrew Dice Clay Dicer,

361
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:49,413
Rowdy Roddy Piper Popcorn Popper.

362
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:52,082
The Henry Winkler Sprinkler.
The Bret Michaels Poison Control Kit.

363
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,385
And a whole set of knives
that could cut through a can.

364
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:56,771
I used to ask your mom if
she wanted to split a beer,

365
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,285
then I'd cut that sucker right in two.

366
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:00,474
But before we maxed out your dad's card,

367
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:02,310
they sent us another one,
through the mail,

368
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:03,444
with my name on it.

369
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:06,147
And that's when we really went to town.

370
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:07,648
Big-ticket items, Jimmy.

371
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:09,317
Things rich people have:

372
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:10,868
night-vision goggles,

373
00:14:10,902 --> 00:14:12,787
an answering machine/phone combo,

374
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:14,271
an electric card-shuffler,

375
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:16,874
a Darth Vader boombox
with a lightsaber antenna.

376
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:18,242
We spent hundreds.

377
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:20,294
So when you were telling me
that you never used credit

378
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:22,580
because it was bad,
that was a load of crap.

379
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:26,000
No, we were trying to protect
you from the evil, Jimmy.

380
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,336
We knew we had a problem,

381
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:30,671
but luckily, we reached
our limit on both our cards.

382
00:14:30,722 --> 00:14:33,257
So there's no way anyone was
gonna send us another one again.

383
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,593
But the Devil had other plans.

384
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:37,645
One day, a new card
arrived in the mail...

385
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,180
with your name on it.

386
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:41,515
The bastard went after our child.

387
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:43,300
We could have easily
sliced through that card

388
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:44,685
with our fancy new knives,

389
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:46,520
then effortlessly cut through a tomato,

390
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:49,473
but we were young and
we really wanted a hot tub.

391
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:50,941
And besides,

392
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:53,277
we thought there was a "statue
of imitations" on credit.

393
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:55,029
We thought your record would be clean

394
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,497
by the time you were an adult.

395
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:01,619
We never meant to hurt you, Jimmy.

396
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:03,170
Tomorrow morning,
we're going to the bank.

397
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:04,839
We're gonna tell them what we did,

398
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:06,173
and we're gonna clear your name.

399
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,258
And then that's it.

400
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:08,812
We're not making bad decisions anymore.

401
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:10,594
While we're there, we can
grab some lunch next door

402
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:11,995
at that Mexican-Indian
restaurant

403
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:13,297
the health department finally reopened.

404
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:14,498
JIMMY:
Oh, that's a good idea.

405
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:15,966
I heard their power
went out the other day

406
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,718
for 18 hours and they're selling
anything with chicken in it

407
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:19,167
for real cheap.
Sounds great.

408
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:20,567
We'll take the East River Bridge.

409
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:22,697
There's almost no traffic
since it started cracking.

410
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:29,267
Oh, yes...

411
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:33,358
I seem to have quite a few
notes on you in this file.

412
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:35,861
Hah. "The phone farter."

413
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:39,114
It's not his fault.
He was five years old.

414
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:42,217
Isn't there any way we can
just pay back what we spent?

415
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:45,120
Well, I suppose we could
transfer this debt

416
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:46,572
to the two of you.

417
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:48,590
Which, with penalties and interest,

418
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:53,045
comes to $125,000.76.

419
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:55,881
Two questions: can we pay
that with a credit card,

420
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:57,666
and can we get a credit card?

421
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,302
Can't they just pay back
the amount that they borrowed?

422
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:01,803
It doesn't work that way.

423
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,672
Rules are rules.

424
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,692
What do you think, there's
a magic button I can press

425
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:09,144
that'll make your penalties
and interest disappear?

426
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:13,131
Actually, there is.

427
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,284
This one...

428
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:18,253
...right here.

429
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,991
Nice try,

430
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,826
but these are the fastest fingers

431
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,795
in the Natesville branch.

432
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:29,081
That's why I've never been caught

433
00:16:29,132 --> 00:16:31,800
picking my nose at a red light.

434
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:33,669
And I do it a lot.

435
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:36,338
I'm not going to help you.

436
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:39,258
I detest reckless spenders

437
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:41,260
who live above their means.

438
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,678
But we're not like that anymore.

439
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:44,763
I swear. We never buy
anything we can't afford.

440
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:48,433
He's not lying.
We all work hard at our part-time jobs.

441
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:50,319
Plus, we coupon and
live in a crappy house

442
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:51,770
with my crazy great-grandmother.

443
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,438
Oh...

444
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:58,193
I live with my elderly mother.

445
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,862
Oh, it's not easy...

446
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:03,849
...but I love her.

447
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:07,703
I know exactly how you feel, Dennis.

448
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:10,622
You got to take care of them
the way they took care of you.

449
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,208
Does yours bite, too?

450
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,644
(quietly): Not now, Burt.
I'm doing something here.

451
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:20,415
It does sound like you've
learned your lesson.

452
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,050
Yeah.

453
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,352
I guess everybody makes mistakes

454
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:24,753
when they're younger.

455
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:27,689
I'm gonna help you folks out.

456
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,591
Hey, Dennis,

457
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,860
some idiot parked in my handicap spot.

458
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:33,445
I'm gonna call a tow truck,

459
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:35,113
but you might want to check it out.

460
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:36,148
It's your dream car.

461
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:37,482
(gasps)

462
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:43,071
Whoa, Betty!

463
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,073
I wish I was rich enough

464
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:48,827
to waste money on
a sweet ride like this.

465
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:49,911
Yeah.

466
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,830
I feel dirty just being next to it.

467
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:55,500
Maybe we should go back inside
and finish fixing Jimmy's debt.

468
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:08,630
It's hot out, huh?

469
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:17,618
You almost pulled one
over on old Dennis.

470
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,840
Sure, you've changed your ways.

471
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:23,332
Sure, you don't live above your means.

472
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:26,313
You only drive the
sweetest car ever built.

473
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:27,481
But you don't understand.

474
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:29,316
They found their diamond in the rough.

475
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:33,487
Stop. Just stop.

476
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:35,389
Other than when I'm at
a gentleman's club,

477
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,324
I don't like being lied to.

478
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,529
I'm going to personally make sure

479
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:44,832
that this debt follows
you to your grave.

480
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:46,233
Uh...

481
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,538
Wait, Dennis.

482
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:52,790
It's probably hard to believe,
knowing we own that car,

483
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,075
but as parents, we've
made tons of mistakes.

484
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,595
But up till now, we've always
been able to fix it

485
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:59,880
so they didn't follow Jimmy
around for the rest of his life.

486
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:01,849
That's not true.
It is true, Jimmy.

487
00:19:01,883 --> 00:19:03,134
We've been terrible parents.

488
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,602
Oh, no, no, no, that part's true.

489
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:06,470
But the mistakes you made,
they followed me around.

490
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:07,972
You never made me do my homework,

491
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,558
which is why I couldn't get any
job that required any education.

492
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:11,872
You never took me to the dentist,

493
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:13,727
so when the wind blows, my gums bleed.

494
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,762
And you never let me
make my own decisions,

495
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,931
which is why I rely
on you and my fiancée

496
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,483
to tell me what to do.

497
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,735
Jimmy, we tried our best.
Oh, yeah?

498
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,405
Was your best letting my
great-grandmother circumcise me?

499
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:27,041
I mean, it's no wonder I always
pee a little bit to the left.

500
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:28,375
What do you expect me to do?

501
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,327
Pull foreskin out of my pocket
and reattach it?

502
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,079
Please give Jimmy his credit back.

503
00:19:32,113 --> 00:19:33,714
We'll give you anything you want.

504
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,385
Her.

505
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,589
I want her.

506
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:44,475
Well, I am flattered, but...

507
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,895
Ah...

508
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,398
JIMMY:
<i>It wasn't how they imagined it,</i>

509
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:54,018
<i>but Mom and Dad did</i>
<i>get to use the DeLorean</i>

510
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,136
<i>to go back in time and change the past.</i>

511
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,655
Ah.

512
00:19:57,689 --> 00:19:58,756
Oof!

513
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,807
JIMMY:
<i>And I got my credit back.</i>

514
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,947
<i>In the end, the one good thing</i>

515
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:08,815
<i>that came out of my parents</i>
<i>ruining my credit</i>

516
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,835
<i>was that I was determined not to.</i>

517
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:15,756
Oh! Should we get
the navigation?

518
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,258
Ah, I know my way around Natesville.

519
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:18,425
The rear-view camera?

520
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,927
That's what back bumpers are for.

521
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:20,961
The entertainment system?

522
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:22,546
So many people have those.

523
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:23,881
We'll just tailgate a mini-van

524
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,566
and Hope can see as
many movies as she wants.

525
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,935
Sunroof?
We'll take the basic model.

526
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:30,638
And is there any way
that you can finance that

527
00:20:30,672 --> 00:20:32,122
under the name "Hope Chance"?

528
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,776
I'm just kidding.

529
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:45,236
Come on, come on...
you're getting closer.

530
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,287
Come on! Out of the way!

531
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:48,489
Come on!

532
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:49,573
Just a little more.

533
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:52,126
Almost there...

534
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,629
Come on...

535
00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:57,081
Yes!

536
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,799
(laughs) Yes! Yes!

537
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:01,335
Holy crap!

538
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:02,536
Ah!

539
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,140
(horse whinnies)

540
00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:07,291
Wha...?

541
00:21:12,531 --> 00:21:13,998
Oh, my God!

542
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:16,200
It worked!

543
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,201
What year is it?

544
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,153
Is it 2013?

545
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:21,855
Nope. Here at Howdy's,
it's 1829.

546
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:23,890
Hey, why don't you mosey into
Howdy's General Store

547
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,960
for a five-cent sarsaparilla?

548
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,278
No time, partner.

549
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,330
I'm off to the year 2008

550
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:31,832
to marry Susan Boyle

551
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:34,285
before she got rich and famous.
(laughing)

00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:43,552
