I just received some news.

00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:11,877
You, Ron Swanson,
have been nominated for an award

00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,996
from the Indiana
Fine Woodworking Association.

7
00:00:13,998 --> 00:00:16,082
How did you hear
about that?

8
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:17,383
I've had
a "Ron Swanson" Google alert

9
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,618
for seven years
and it finally paid off.

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,755
Recently,
I made a chair.

11
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:26,642
When I was finished,
I thought it was a good chair.

12
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:30,096
I submitted it to the Indiana
Fine Woodworking Association,

13
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:33,966
who felt it merited
consideration for an award.

I'm very honored
by this nomination.

This might be
the first time

19

I've ever wanted
to attend an event.

this is a big deal.

be there alone.

That's correct.
I'm bringing Diane.

very well with us.

he slipped on a cinnabon

I could stop anywhere for that.

just family.

And Ben and Chris.

This is literally

I've ever had.

but I think you just drank

164
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,744
some of the regular,
full-fat eggnog.

Chris,
one cup won't kill you.

166

No, but it will add
exactly 440 calories.

I'm fine.

Mmm! I don't know
if you know this,

170
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:19,261
but things
with fat in them

171
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:21,397
taste way better
than things with no fat.

172
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,449
Yeah, Chris--
everybody knows that.

173
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,485
Ron, guess
why my thumbs are up.

174
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:27,936
No.

175
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,439
Because I'm giving you
my 100% approval about Diane.

176
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,825
She is perfect for you.
She gets you.

177
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:36,078
She is at the bar right
now ordering a Lagavulin, neat

178
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,963
for you. I mean,
she's even putting up

179
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:41,333
with all this stupid,
boring woodworking stuff.

180
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:44,303
I'm sorry, but, you know,
it's not the Super Bowl, guys.

181
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:45,921
Let's take it down
a notch.

182
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:48,123
Anyway,
you have my approval.

183
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,141
I don't need
your approval.

184
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,259
- But you have it.
- Don't need it.

185
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:52,628
But you got it.

186
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,346
This could
end up being

187
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,315
the best night
in Ron Swanson's life.

188
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:57,600
I am so, so happy
for him--

189
00:06:57,602 --> 00:07:00,986
Hello, you gorgeous craftsmen.

190
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,971
Wow,
look at this room.

191
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:05,991
So much wood,
ready to be worked.

192
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:08,861
[Bleep] me!

193
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,050
[Humming]

194
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:14,216
Alert...
alert, alert, alert.

195
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,016
She's here, isn't she?

196
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,687
Oh, hey, Ron.
What a coincidence.

197
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,855
Gosh, I never dreamed
you'd be here.

198
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:23,908
Tammy,
this is Diane.

199
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,211
Diane, this is a piece
of human garbage named Tammy,

200
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,546
who is also
my ex-wife.

201
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,548
Twice ex-wife.
We were married twice.

202
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,749
And divorced twice.

203
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,834
Everything is done.
They are totally done.

204
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:35,553
Tammy,
what are you doing here?

205
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:39,373
Oh, I just have a little
something I need to get drilled.

206
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,509
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

207
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:43,310
Everything's fine,
we're just gonna chat.

208
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:46,964
Shouldn't you be at the library,
forcing people to borrow books?

209
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,098
Leslie,
you and I both know

210
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,650
that the library closes
at 3:00 p.m.

211
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:51,152
Of course it does.

212
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:52,653
Besides, I like
to keep tabs on Ron.

213
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:54,304
So you can ruin
his life?

214
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:55,739
So I can have fun
with him,

215
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,809
and sometimes ruining his life
can be a part of that, sure.

216
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,661
This may be
the hardest challenge yet

217
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:02,145
for Leslie Knope,
emotional guardian.

218
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,198
I need to protect
a sweet couple

219
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,167
from a sex-crazed
demon librarian

220
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:08,919
who makes me question my stance
on using the "B" word.

221
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,337
I don't know,
maybe just this once.

222
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:13,323
No, Leslie, fight it.
Fight it.

223
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:16,660
[Groans]
It looks warm in there!

224
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,845
Warm and happy.

225
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:20,297
Mm, look at
that gingerbread man.

226
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,466
What? I don't see
any gingerbread cookies.

227
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,334
I'm talking about that
jacked-up, light-skinned dude.

228
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,686
Look like
Blake Griffin.

229
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:27,521
[Whispering]
You guys!

230
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:30,357
There's a buffet--
in the house!

231
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:32,142
I didn't even know
you could do that!

232
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,611
We need
to crash this party.

233
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,645
[Knocking at window]

234
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,798
Ann, let us in.

235
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,150
Let's go.

236
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:42,369
Well, well, well.

237
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:45,522
You want to come
into Jerry's party?

238
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:46,874
And why is that?

239
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,692
I need a place
to deliver this baby, Ann.

240
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,044
It's coming out of me right now.
I'm pregnant.

241
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:51,045
[Breathes rhythmically]

242
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:52,496
This is a lovely party

243
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,249
thrown by a lovely man
and his lovely family.

244
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,001
There's no place
for meanies.

245
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,169
Aw, forget it,
I'm coming in.

246
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,170
Ow!

247
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,755
- Get off me.
- Wait.

248
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:03,707
[Laughs]
You're so weak, really?

249
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,758
- [Groans]
- I mean,

250
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,176
I'm barely even
doing anything.

251
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,262
Are you iron-deficient?
Let me look at your palm.

252
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:10,598
Ow. It's because
of your man strength,

253
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,182
Man Perkins.

254
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,434
Let us in, Ann.

255
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:14,768
It's cold outside,
and I can't wear mittens

256
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,687
'cause they're unflattering
to my hands.

257
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,439
Sorry, guys.
This is your penance.

258
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,891
You can come in if you
do something nice for Jerry.

259
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,027
Hey, I already
did something nice for Jerry.

260
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,362
I drove here
to take him to Jerry Dinner.

261
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,731
Oh, Donna.
You can come in.

262
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,749
- [Gasps]
- Okay.

263
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:29,900
- What? What about us?
- [Snickers]

264
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,086
- What? Donna!
- Merry critches, bitches!

265
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,754
Donna, don't leave us!
Donna?

266
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:35,072
Oh, well, whatever.

267
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,291
It's Jerry's party.
How cool could it be?

268
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:38,709
[Gasps]
Santa!

269
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,077
- They have a Santa!
- Oh, my God.

270
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,745
- What?
- Aw!

271
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,749
Welcome to the Indiana Fine
Woodworking Association Awards.

272
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,135
[Cheers and applause]

273
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:50,104
I'm your host,
Martin Housely,

274
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,305
and wow,
it's gonna be a great show--

275
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:52,306
knock on wood.

276
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:54,358
[Laughter]

277
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,760
- That's good.
- Oh, my gosh.

278
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,762
What a coinky-dinky. Look,
we're sitting at the same table!

279
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,699
Tammy,
this table is reserved.

280
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,867
A guy traded me his seat
for a peek and a squeeze.

281
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,869
That's my boob and my butt,
respectively.

282
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,905
Remember that, Ron?

283
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,290
Subtle.

284
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,941
Well, you know, they asked me
if I would host this event,

285
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,945
and I said, "Would I?"
[Laughter]

286
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,447
Ben, come meet
Jerry's wife.

287
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:18,382
Gayle?

288
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:23,453
- Happy holidays, Chris.
- It's so good to see you.

289
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:24,588
I have someone
I'd like you to meet.

290
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,124
I'm Gayle Gergich.

291
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:30,594
Gayle--
you're Gayle?

292
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,012
Jerry's
beautiful wife...

293
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:34,648
- Oh.
- Who looks like that.

294
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,966
- [Chuckles]
- Gayle, I hope you're not

295
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,068
in any way uncomfortable
that I'm here,

296
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,105
- since I dated your daughter.
- Oh, not at all.

297
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,157
You're welcome here
any time.

298
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:46,276
Oops, there's a little hair
on your shoulder.

299
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,477
Oh.

300
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:51,281
- Well, look who's a silver fox.
- [Laughs]

301
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,001
Will you look at that?

302
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:55,953
I'm sorry,
you're okay?

303
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,155
You don't feel like
your body is in decay

304
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,423
or death
is inevitable?

305
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,660
My, my. Somebody's
being a gloomy goose.

306
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:07,181
Yeah.
Relax, gloomy goose.

307
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:11,719
Welcome, everybody,
to another Gergich Christmas.

308
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,138
Sadly, one of our
three beautiful angels,

309
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,472
Millicent,
couldn't be here tonight,

310
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,392
but our other two beauties--
Miriam and Gladys--

311
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:21,395
are going to help Gayle
and me play a little tune.

Why does everyone act
like Jerry's the victim here?

He's the one
that didn't invite us

323
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,479
to his Christmas party.
[Gasps]

324
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,981
- Jerry Filter!
- Jerry Filter!

00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,433
Who's Jerry Filter?

326
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:02,236
Unsurprisingly, Jerry sends
a lot of annoying emails.

327
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:04,855
So a while ago, I put
a filter on all our accounts.

328
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,524
Everything from Jerry
goes directly to spam.

A-a-and...

330
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,863
Here's our invitation.

331
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,065
There's three years
of nice messages on here.

on your wedding.

"Hope you have
the best birthday, Tom."

00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:23,290
I just tied my high score
in Snake.

336
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:29,113
Our next award
is for "Achievement in Chairs."

337
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,599
The nominees are:
Asa Christiana for chair,

338
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,601
Ron Swanson for chair,

339
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:37,221
- H.W. Davenport for chair.
- So exciting, Ron.

340
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,690
Okay, Ron,
this is your moment.

341
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,558
Tune her out.
She's not even here.

342
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,227
And the winner is...

343
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,028
Ron Swanson for chair.

344
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,098
Oh, wow! Whoo!

345
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,119
[Applause]

346
00:12:56,107 --> 00:13:00,127
This award is the only one
I'd ever give a damn about.

347
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:04,748
I made my first chair
when I was five,

348
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,834
but the quality of the wood
was wanting,

349
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:09,803
so when I turned nine,
I used my factory wages

350
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:12,789
to purchase
some beautiful local walnut.

351
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,961
Uh, thank you...
for this...

352
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,098
Uh, this all good--
night good.

353
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,484
Uh...

354
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,519
There it is.

355
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:30,774
[Hesitant applause]

356
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:34,528
Hey, you're looking
at a picture of Millie.

357
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,663
You want to take off,
grab some vegan fries?

358
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:38,499
She really
was delightful.

359
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:40,650
I truly wish her
all the best.

360
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:44,288
Man, maybe going to therapy
1,000 times a week is helping.

361
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,039
I mean, if you'd seen
that picture a month ago,

362
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,257
you would have
fallen apart.

363
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,326
[Chuckles]
It's just a picture.

364
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,961
- Millie!
- Hi, mom!

365
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,429
Both: [Giggling]

366
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,464
We wanted to surprise you
and come home early.

367
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,766
[Giggles]

368
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,684
Oh, hey, Chris.

369
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:00,304
Hi.

370
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,472
Let's take a moment now
to remember

371
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,858
those woodworkers
who are no longer with us,

372
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,511
and the beautiful coffins
they all designed themselves.

373
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:12,032
[Sad piano music]

374
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:13,033
Hey.

375
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:14,535
- Hey.
- Have you seen Ron?

376
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:17,187
He disappeared after the speech
and I can't find him anywhere.

377
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,689
Diane-- ugh.
The stuff with Tammy

378
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:22,042
is so complex and weird
and gross.

379
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:24,527
It just would probably be better
if you let me handle it.

380
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,029
I'm not worried
about Tammy.

381
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,198
I mean, I'm a middle school
vice-principal.

382
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,500
I deal with hormonal psychopaths
all the time.

383
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,969
Oh, great. Good.

384
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,537
- What concerns me is you.
- You who?

385
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,173
- You you.
- You me?

386
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,707
You're the one who's been
at his side all night.

387
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,042
You're the one
who's been protecting him,

388
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,011
you're the one who knows
all the intimate details

389
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,813
of his romantic history
with that monster.

390
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,898
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Diane, you misunderstand.

391
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,483
I'm happily engaged.

392
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,486
You and Ron have an intimacy
that I just don't understand,

393
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,822
so if there is a threat
to my relationship with Ron,

394
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,242
it's not Tammy.
It's you.

395
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:57,411
Okay, folks,
fasten your seatbelts.

396
00:14:57,413 --> 00:15:00,247
It's the big one:
Best Desk.

397
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:01,748
[Applause]

398
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:05,557
Where's Diane?
I need her.

399
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,257
- She left.
- Of course.

400
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:08,508
Tammy ruins everything.

401
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,876
No, she left
because of me.

402
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:12,645
She's threatened
by our relationship.

403
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:14,481
[Laughs]

404
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:16,099
That's ridiculous.

405
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:18,435
I don't think of you
romantically.

406
00:15:18,437 --> 00:15:20,770
You're pro-government,
you never stop talking,

407
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:23,073
and you have blonde hair.
You're my worst nightmare.

408
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:24,858
Excuse me,
one man's "worst nightmare"

409
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,744
is every other man's
"total package."

410
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,729
But the point is,
I don't think it's about dating.

411
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:31,898
I kind of see
where Diane is coming from.

412
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,068
We are close friends, and
I'm very involved in your life.

413
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,336
I wouldn't say
we're close.

414
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:38,288
By Swanson standards,
we're close.

415
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,456
I know
when your birthday is.

416
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,874
So does Baskin-Robbins.

417
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:43,343
I know that you
secretly love artichokes

418
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:45,178
- and plums.
- Keep your voice down, woman!

419
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:49,132
Fine, we're friends.
So what do I do?

420
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:51,051
Tammy's waiting for me
in my car.

421
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:54,104
I think you should take my car
and go get Diane,

422
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:56,556
and I will
handle Tammy.

423
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:57,774
Thank you.

424
00:15:57,776 --> 00:15:59,509
Protect your eyes,
she's a gouger.

425
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:00,426
Good to know.

426
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:03,196
Chris, I'd like you
to meet my fiance, Carl.

427
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:04,864
- Well.
- Hi, there.

428
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:06,949
Hi.
How did you two meet?

429
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:07,950
Whitewater rafting.

430
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:09,819
He was
the young rafting instructor

431
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:11,070
all the girls
were into,

432
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:12,655
and I was
the young rafting instructor

433
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:13,790
all the guys were into...
[Laughs]

434
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,524
And then we got together.
[Laughs]

435
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:17,193
Ah, so random, right?

436
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:20,463
What a story! I felt like
my heart was whitewater rafting.

437
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:22,248
[Laughter]
Well, I won't keep you guys.

438
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,549
It's good to see you.
Mwah.

439
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,968
Oh, little tip,
there is fat in the eggnog.

440
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,303
Okay.
[Chuckles]

441
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:29,889
So how'd it go?
You okay?

442
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:31,391
[Sighs]

443
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:32,875
I'm fine.

444
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:34,394
If therapy
has taught me anything,

445
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:36,212
it's that I need
to face my fears,

446
00:16:36,214 --> 00:16:38,898
even when my fears
are engaged to a man

447
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,567
with the chiseled jawline
of a young me.

448
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:43,019
Thank you, Ben.

449
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:44,187
Thank me?
For what?

450
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:46,389
For looking out for me
tonight.

451
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:47,907
You're a good friend.

452
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:50,443
Hey...

453
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:52,228
So Gayle and Jerry--

454
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,947
I've thought about it a lot.
There's no logical explanation.

455
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,451
[Chuckles]

456
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:00,286
Well, hello there,
Big B--

457
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:03,756
Gross! Leslie?
Where's Ron?

458
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:05,425
Too late, Tammy.
Ron's gone.

459
00:17:05,427 --> 00:17:06,742
- [Scoffs]
- You'll never get him back.

460
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:09,512
Wanna bet?
That relationship is weak.

461
00:17:09,514 --> 00:17:12,932
All I have to do is find Ron
within the next few hours,

462
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:14,417
and he's toast.

463
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:17,086
Few hours, you say?

464
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:18,137
Leslie!

465
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:19,856
Stop this car!
Where are we going?

466
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:21,357
I don't know.

467
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,426
You're gonna
regret this!

468
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:26,229
Well, hello again.

469
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:27,897
You ready
to be nice to Jerry?

470
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:30,116
Because it's so cold
out here,

471
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:32,235
it reminds me
of my wife's lasagna.

472
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:34,103
I actually
like that one.

473
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:36,572
Hey, guys!
I thought you weren't coming.

474
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:38,708
I--you know,
never got your RSVP.

475
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,961
Hi, Jerry. We got you a gift.
Merry Christmas.

476
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:43,246
Yeah, just--

477
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,281
we took up a collection
to pay your hospital bills,

478
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:48,134
since you almost
farted yourself to death.

479
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:49,585
Every time
we did something mean,

480
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:51,454
we put a dollar
in a box.

481
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:54,424
Wow. I'm the luckiest man
on earth.

482
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:57,009
Okay, well, come on in!
It's a party.

483
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:05,101
Uh--
Oh, jeez.

484
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:07,687
- Give me the keys!
- No!

485
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,939
- Give 'em to me!
- Never!

486
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:11,991
Hey,
game over, Tammy.

487
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,777
- What? You--!
- Ah!

488
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:16,479
I'm going in!

489
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:17,580
[Screams]

490
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:21,501
[Both struggling]

491
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:23,870
Oh, my God,
I am so turned on right now.

492
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:25,455
What is wrong
with you?

493
00:18:25,457 --> 00:18:27,089
Oh, yeah, tell me
you're not feeling this.

494
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:28,591
You are so crazy!

495
00:18:28,593 --> 00:18:29,842
I got 'em!

496
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:30,927
- I got 'em.
- No!

497
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:32,345
[Both struggling]

498
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:33,596
- No!
- Ah!

499
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:34,764
You'll never catch me!

500
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:36,382
Come back here-- Ow!

501
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:37,550
- [Cackles]
- You are not

502
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,634
gonna ruin this night!

503
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:40,102
- Get away from this car!
- No!

504
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:41,938
[Screams]
What are you doing?

505
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,306
You're crazy!

506
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:46,008
Ron! Ron!
Ha!

507
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,009
You're too late!

508
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,311
- [Yells]
- [Starts]

509
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:51,113
- [Humming]
- No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

510
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:55,885
She just knows you so well,
and I was starting to wonder

511
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:57,703
if I was ever
gonna get to that point.

512
00:18:57,995 --> 00:18:59,739
I'm worried
that maybe

513
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:01,958
there isn't room in your life
for another woman.

514
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,911
At this very moment,
Leslie is throwing herself

515
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:08,998
in front of a freight train
named Tammy for me and you.

516
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,551
Leslie is a wonderful,

in my life,

visit Europe

519

than have something romantic
happen between us.

get to know me even better.

I want to show you something
