1
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,276
My frlend Charlotte
was datlng Dr. Bram Walker...

2
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,819
...a very hardworklng orthopedlc surgeon.

3
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,588
Bram?

4
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,385
What?

5
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,260
Were you asIeep?

6
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,661
No, I was just resting my eyes.

7
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,398
My God.

8
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,328
I feII asIeep for one second.

9
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,764
My God.

10
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,136
I was up at 5:00, I had three carpaI tunneIs.

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,038
It's very exhaustive reconstructive work.

12
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,141
He feII asIeep when
he was making Iove to me.

13
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,874
He feII asIeep!

14
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,380
He was tired.
This has nothing to do with you.

15
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,254
Has a man ever faIIen asIeep
making Iove to you?

16
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,722
No, but I'm sure many of them wanted to.

17
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,392
I can't beIieve this happened to me!

18
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,929
You want some herb tea?

19
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,192
I must be reaIIy bad in bed.

20
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,324
You are not bad in bed.

21
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,733
I've got Constant Comment and....

22
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,265
Do you want some Tummy Tamer?

23
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,068
Of course it's her.
I have to say, I'm not surprised.

24
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,611
Ever seen her on a Stairmaster?
Nothing happening beIow the waist.

25
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,941
Nada. No saIe.

26
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,571
How can you say that?

27
00:01:55,648 --> 00:02:00,142
Even if she was bad in bed,
which she isn't, is it reaIIy that important?

28
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:03,984
AbsoIuteIy. Who we are in bed
is who we are in Iife.

29
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,957
I never met a man who was bad in bed
who was good at Iife.

30
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,494
Just for the record, in bed, you are....

31
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,527
Don't make me state the obvious.

32
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,895
How can you be so sure?

33
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,061
No one ever took a nap whiIe fucking me...

34
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,228
...and I get affirmations aII the time.

35
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,465
Just Iast week....

36
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:25,537
Last week, Samantha had dlnner
wlth a gay couple she'd known for years.

37
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,303
Davld and Davld.

38
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,941
Thanks for a IoveIy dinner. It was fun.

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,484
I have to admit,
we have an uIterior motive.

40
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:34,977
What?

41
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,189
We're wondering if you're seeing
anyone speciaI right now?

42
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,958
ActuaIIy, no.

43
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,427
Do you have a hot guy for me?

44
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,256
Two.

45
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,131
-No!
-Yes!

46
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,070
We want to have sex with a woman.

47
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,301
-Are you serious?
-TotaIIy.

48
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,843
I'm curious about it.

49
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,143
We've never done it
and we thought it might be fun.

50
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,308
We were Iike:

51
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,712
''If we were gonna do it with a woman,
who wouId it be?''

52
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,483
-Then we were Iike, Samantha.
-TotaIIy.

53
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:16,525
We decided of aII the beautifuI women
we know, you are probabIy the best in bed.

54
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,088
TotaIIy.

55
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,764
Look at that!

56
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,566
I'm thinking about doing it.
They're cute, they're heaIthy.

57
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,932
They're gay!

58
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,940
For a sex coIumnist,
you have a Iimited view of sexuaIity.

59
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,970
Gay as pink suede.

60
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,739
Wake up. It's 2000.

61
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:37,240
The new miIIennium won't be about sexuaI
IabeIs, it'II be about sexuaI expression.

62
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,850
It won't matter if you're sIeeping
with men or women.

63
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,080
It'II be about sIeeping with individuaIs.

64
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,053
Or in your case, twos or threes.

65
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:48,457
Soon everyone wiII be pansexuaI.
It won't matter if you're gay or straight.

66
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,463
-Just if you're good or bad in bed.
-ExactIy.

67
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,427
That nlght I got to thlnklng about bed.

68
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:59,369
Are we secretly belng graded every tlme
we lnvlte someone to joln us ln lt?

69
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,135
A plus, B, D, lncomplete.

70
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,572
Is maklng love really nothlng
more than a pop qulz?

71
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:10,115
If sex ls a test, how do we know
lf we're passlng or falllng?

72
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,747
How do you know lf you're good ln bed?

73
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:19,184
Later on, I was walklng home thlnklng
about my sexual report card when....

74
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,795
What the heII--

75
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,862
Christ, I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
I threw my cigarette.

76
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,095
I thought I was stung by a bee. Jesus!

77
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,730
I'm sorry. Did it Ieave a mark?

78
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,075
You can't smoke in the restaurant.
I'm a smoker.

79
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,509
I'm a smoker too,
but watch where you throw those things?

80
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,846
No, it didn't Ieave a mark.

81
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,681
As the paln subslded,
my mlnd was free to notlce...

82
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,086
...how lncredlbly cute thls guy was.

83
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,351
I am sorry. My name's Patrick Casey.

84
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,785
Carrie Bradshaw, burn victim.

85
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,690
How weird was that? That was intense.

86
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,530
You gotta admit,
it's a cIever way to meet the Iadies.

87
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,961
You got a IittIe comedy routine
going there?

88
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,471
LittIe bit.

89
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,908
Listen, I reaIIy feeI bad.

90
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,243
At Ieast Iet me buy you a coffee,
or some burn saIve?

91
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,714
-Not funny yet.
-Sorry.

92
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,882
But it might be after a cappuccino.

93
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,952
There's a pIace right around the corner.
We can smoke there.

94
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,722
Three Marlboros and two
Marlboro Llghts later I had learned...

95
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,623
...Patrlck was a composer,
wrltlng muslc for movles.

96
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,060
What type of movies do you compose for?

97
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,564
ReaIIy bad ones.

98
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,896
The I Screamed When I Knew What You
Dld Last Summer On Elm Street types.

99
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,369
As Iong as you're chaIIenged
by what you do.

100
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,768
Dammit. Patrick Casey, whoever you are.

101
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,241
I'm Iate. I have to go.

102
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,545
Thank you for the coffee.

103
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,446
Maybe one day
you'II give me scar tissue again.

104
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,790
-You're great.
-Thanks.

105
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,250
As I walked away, I started to thlnk.:

106
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:06,828
How many cute, smart, slngle smokers
are there left ln the world? Seven?

107
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,036
I declded to do somethlng
I almost never do...

108
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,264
...glve a man my phone number.

109
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:18,174
This whoIe burn Iawsuit I pIan to initiate...

110
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:23,072
...it might get a IittIe crazy,
so here is my phone number.

111
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,514
You wiII need that for your attorney...

112
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,486
...or if you want to have
coffee again sometime.

113
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:33,492
I left feellng great. It was such a cute
approach. How could he not call?

114
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,894
How couId he not caII?
It's been three days.

115
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:41,159
Give him 12 more hours and then
send him off to the isIand of Iost men.

116
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,291
I don't wanna send him there, I Iike him.

117
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,430
CouId you beIieve that someone actuaIIy
had the nerve to caII this FIorentine Peach?

118
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,400
I can't beIieve you spent
this much on sheets.

119
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:54,001
It's an experiment.
I'm trying to change my bed karma.

120
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,874
I figure if I can make my bed
a pIace I reaIIy want to be...

121
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,009
...others wiII feeI the same way.

122
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,684
The fieId of dreams.

123
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,548
ExactIy. ''If you buiId it, he wiII come.''

124
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:09,726
The thing that gets me is, I'm not usuaIIy
wrong about the phone number size-up.

125
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,696
I don't put it out there
unIess I'm sure it's coming back.

126
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,633
I'm either reaIIy Ioving or hating the coIor.

127
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,601
He thinks I'm ugIy.

128
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,196
My God. Get a grip.

129
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,699
A guy doesn't caII you for three days
and you're ugIy?

130
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,405
-What's your point?
-PiIIowcase.

131
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,680
It's amazing.
We can feeI totaIIy good about ourseIves...

132
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:36,811
...and then it aII goes out the window
if the guy doesn't mirror it back to us.

133
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,784
This has a IittIe weird thing here.

134
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,651
Dammit. Does everything I bring into
this bedroom have to have a fIaw?

135
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:51,132
The next day I was ln the Vlllage looklng
for the perfect $7 dress...

136
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,364
...to go wlth my $300 shoes, when....

137
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,069
I had a cholce.
I could turn around and run away...

138
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,111
...or I could smlle, be brave
and walk on over.

139
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,044
Hi.

140
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,277
So what? Saturday's the day you stand on
the street and smoke in the ViIIage?

141
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,082
Hi, I'm Carrie.

142
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,856
-We're kind of in the middIe of something.
-Right, sure.

143
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,456
Bye. I was on my way to Perry Street.

144
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,897
This is Perry Street.

145
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,293
BIeecker, I meant BIeecker.

146
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,303
Okay, bye. Goodbye to you, too.

147
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,779
-Let me expIain.
-No, I'm embarrassed.

148
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,148
You're obviousIy in the middIe
of a thing with your Iover...

149
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,016
...or whoever and I'm there....

150
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm not gay.

151
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,959
I'm an aIcohoIic.

152
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,285
We were waiting for a meeting to start.

153
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,829
I wanted to introduce you
but it's supposed to be anonymous.

154
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,796
I reaIIy wasn't getting the gay vibe
from you.

155
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,501
It's just, he was so cute and....

156
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,035
-I never caIIed.
-Right.

157
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,605
I was freaked. I've onIy been
in the program 11 months...

158
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,807
...and my sponsor said I reaIIy shouIdn't
get invoIved with someone for a year.

159
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,019
Okay, maybe you'II caII me in a month.

160
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,988
It doesn't bother you that I'm an aIcohoIic?

161
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,216
God, no. I Iove aIcohoIics.
HeII, I hope to be one someday.

162
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,988
-That was a joke.
-That's not funny, yet.

163
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,655
But it might be after a cappuccino.

164
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,427
What the fuck, it's onIy a coupIe of weeks.

165
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,494
WouId you Iike to go on a date sometime?

166
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,797
I can't think why not.

167
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,765
You caII me.

168
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,173
I accepted hls klnd lnvltatlon
because when you thlnk about lt...

169
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,545
...aren't we all ln recovery from somethlng?

170
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,017
Drlnklng? Drugglng?
Our last relatlonshlp?

171
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,988
On our flrst date,
Patrlck and I went for coffee.

172
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:56,083
I'm reaIIy compuIsive. If I open up a bag
of Chips Ahoy, I gotta eat the whoIe thing.

173
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,430
I'm Iike that with Reese's Pieces.
Reese's Pieces and shoes.

174
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,831
WouIdn't the shoes
be a IittIe tough on digestion?

175
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,903
This is me.

176
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,772
Thank you, Mr. Casey. I had a great time.

177
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,213
No, Miss Burn Victim.
I had the great time.

178
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,882
Then I gave hlm my very best
lean-ln-and-klss-me-goodnlght move.

179
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,291
Our next date, over dlnner,
he told me about worklng hls 12 steps.

180
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:39,334
After dlnner, I stood on my thlrd step
trylng to work hlm.

181
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,770
That smeII is amazing. What is that?

182
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,534
Me.

183
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,370
I'II caII you.

184
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,542
I couldn't flgure lt out.

185
00:10:56,622 --> 00:11:00,558
I knew he wanted me, because durlng my
lean-ln-and-klss-me-goodnlght move...

186
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,118
...I'd accldentally, on purpose felt
hls pop-up-and-say-hello.

187
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,255
What was golng on?

188
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,461
By the thlrd date, I wanted hlm even more
than a flstful of Reese's Pleces.

189
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,239
WeII then, goodnight.

190
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,641
That was that. I'd hlt my humlllatlon llmlt.

191
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:25,342
Then I thought, how many cute,
smart, sexy, slngle, smoklng alcohollcs...

192
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,046
...are there left ln the world? Flve?

193
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,458
Do you want to come up?

194
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,902
But you see, the thing is,
I've never had sex sober.

195
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,668
I've aIways been drunk or high.
I don't know if I'II be any good.

196
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,739
What the heII?
Let's take it one step at a time.

197
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,131
Sex is amazing.

198
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,103
It feeIs so fucking amazing.

199
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,872
Do other peopIe know about this?

200
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,236
AII right! I did it! Sex without beer!

201
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,615
Easy, cowboy.

202
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,246
You!

203
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,114
What about you! You are the best.

204
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,517
You weren't haIf bad yourseIf.

205
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,719
You are the best.

206
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,696
-You're the best.
-I aim to pIease.

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,867
After we have a cigarette...

208
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,106
...can we do it again?

209
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,744
I'II have a Spanish omeIet, hash browns,
more coffee and orange juice.

210
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,580
Can I have some rice pudding
for Iater? Thanks.

211
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,549
Storing up for winter?

212
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,487
No, I'm starving. Patrick and I....

213
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,794
AII Iast night and I'm just....

214
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,325
No, don't stop, it's okay.

215
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,126
Just because I'm bad in bed
doesn't mean everybody is.

216
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,564
One more time.

217
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,865
You are not bad in bed.

218
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,235
ReaIIy? Has a man ever faIIen asIeep
making Iove to you?

219
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,436
No, but I once feII asIeep when a guy was
doing me. It was the Iudes.

220
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,500
It's okay.

221
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:38,280
I'm mature enough to reaIize that whiIe
I may be good at some things Iike...

222
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:42,347
...accessories, that I might need heIp
in others Iike....

223
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,248
-Fucking?
-Making Iove.

224
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,623
So, I'm taking a cIass.

225
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,229
A fucking cIass?

226
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,964
No, a tantric sex workshop.

227
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,531
Just don't drink any suspicious KooI-Aid
or put on new Nikes.

228
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:01,399
It's not Iike that. It's taught by a
weII-respected woman psychoIogist.

229
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,332
It's caIIed ''How To PIease A Man.''

230
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:08,076
I know how to pIease a man.
Just give away most of your power.

231
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,116
I have a trainer for the gym.
I can have a trainer for--

232
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,878
-Fucking?
-PIease stop saying that.

233
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,322
Are you actuaIIy going to do this?

234
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,391
Seating was Iimited,
so I signed you guys up.

235
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,031
PIease? I can't go aIone.

236
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,300
If Bram ever faIIs asIeep on me again,
I wiII die.

237
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,427
Pretty pIease, with sugar on it?

238
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,233
Christ, I'm in.

239
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,635
What the heII, I don't exactIy
have them hanging from the rafters.

240
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,008
''How To PIease A Man.''

241
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,908
I couId teach the damn cIass.

242
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,277
AII right.

243
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,454
That nlght,
whlle Davld and Davld got undressed...

244
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,584
...and walted for her ln the bedroom.

245
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,095
Samantha began to wonder
lf maybe she was about to go too far.

246
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,664
Was she actually capable
of belng thls sexually free?

247
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,395
Or was she gettlng ln over her head?

248
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:10,366
She declded before there were regrets,
they should all talk about lt a llttle more.

249
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,535
Listen, David and David, maybe....

250
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,845
You Iook amazing.

251
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,679
Just Iike Jean HarIow in Red Dust.

252
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,279
Samantha loved the Samantha mlrrored
through the eyes of the Davlds.

253
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,087
What the heII?

254
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,332
-They're so soft.
-I know.

255
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,177
-I can't do this.
-Neither can I.

256
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,222
But I....

257
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,852
-We're just getting start--
-No, can't.

258
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,426
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

259
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,896
It's very pretty, but no.

260
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,735
It's not you, it's us.

261
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,668
I have an idea. Let's aII put on our cIothes
and go out for geIati!

262
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,832
-Cheesecake.
-Whatever.

263
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:57,242
Suddenly, Samantha wasn't feellng
so good about herself ln bed.

264
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:07,589
I gotta go or I'm going to be Iate
for the tantric workshop thing.

265
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,354
Baby, you don't need a workshop.

266
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,556
You are amazing.

267
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,699
Come on, one more time.

268
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,803
We did it Iast night and aII this morning.

269
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,701
I couId have sex with you
morning, noon and night.

270
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,501
That's when I reallzed lt.
Mr. Compulslve wasn't ln bed wlth me...

271
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,044
More, c'mon.

272
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,808
...he was ln bed wlth a blg bag
of Chlps Ahoy.

273
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,906
More.

274
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,977
The intent of tantric...

275
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,511
...we say ''sacred sexuaIity...''

276
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:41,317
...is to experience
and merge with the Divine.

277
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,121
I think Patrick's addicted to me.

278
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,790
It's Iike he's repIaced drinking with me.

279
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,457
Program guys are tough.

280
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,161
I dated a guy who was
in Over-Eaters Anonymous.

281
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,967
Every time we had a fight,
he'd binge-eat hot fudge sundaes.

282
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,834
In other words, Iadies,
to drive your man crazy.

283
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,912
He wants to have sex aII the time.
It's getting a IittIe out of hand.

284
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,916
At Ieast he wants to fuck you.

285
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,111
-They were gay.
-So?

286
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,121
One minute they were interested and then,
suddenIy they weren't.

287
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,215
What did I do to turn them off?

288
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,320
Not having a dick wouId be the thing
that you did to turn them off.

289
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,862
You guys, I'm serious. This is rude.

290
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:25,767
Use it to bring any man to his knees.

291
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,669
With Iove, of course.

292
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,173
Where was this bitch Iast night
when I needed her?

293
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,544
Be quiet and you might Iearn something.
This Iady is supposed to be a genius.

294
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:39,851
If she's so good, why is she having
this workshop in her apartment?

295
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,283
I don't know.

296
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:45,780
Tantric sex is not about taIk,
it's about action.

297
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,726
DeIayed action.

298
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,455
So, without further deIay...

299
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,127
...Iet me introduce my husband.

300
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,534
Dr. Ronny Shapiro.

301
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:08,242
I wiII demonstrate the very effective...

302
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,571
...Lingham Massage.

303
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,753
I think I know why we're in an apartment.

304
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,147
The receiver Iies on his back...

305
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,122
...before the giver, naked.

306
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:28,223
GenitaIs cIearIy exposed for the massage.

307
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,924
You're not writing.

308
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,869
Take your time doing this.

309
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:38,805
An hour and a half later, crlppled by our
lnablllty to look away from a car crash...

310
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,938
...we watched as the Dr. Shaplro
lllustrated tantrlc sex.

311
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,312
Massage the head of the Lingham...

312
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,352
...as if you are using an orange juicer.

313
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,947
There go my good feeIings about breakfast.

314
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,659
Stop it! You're embarrassing me.

315
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,394
We're the embarrassing part?

316
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,498
PIace your right hand...

317
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,794
...on the receiver's Root chakra.

318
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,469
Root!

319
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:12,235
The Root chakra is Iocated between
the anus and the genitaIs.

320
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,136
I think that I just got my 50 bucks worth.

321
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:21,842
GentIy rock your hand
to awaken this chakra.

322
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,917
CIinicaIIy referred to as perineum.

323
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,524
Perineum: Latin for
''not without an engagement ring.''

324
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,328
WiII the women who are Iaughing
compose themseIves?

325
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,890
Thank you.

326
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,569
Orgasm is not the goaI
of Lingham Massage...

327
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:44,507
...but can be a pIeasant
and very weIcome side effect.

328
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,504
Watch what I'm doing here.

329
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,610
If you can master this...

330
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,878
...your man wiII aIways be faithfuI.

331
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,420
Because once they go tantric...

332
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,017
...they don't go back.

333
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,524
You go, girI.

334
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,963
See that? Can you aII see this?

335
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,604
My God!

336
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:16,932
He's gonna....

337
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,612
And just llke that,
Mlranda got hlt by Old Falthful.

338
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,047
What's funny?

339
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:40,226
After we talked Mlranda ln from
the ledge, I met Patrlck for a movle.

340
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,732
I was teIIing my sponsor today
how I feIt about you...

341
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:48,167
...and suddenIy I reaIized
maybe I shouId just teII you.

342
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,708
I Iove you.

343
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,403
There lt was, the llttle phrase
every glrl ls dylng to hear...

344
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,109
...a week and a half lnto a relatlonshlp.

345
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,848
Thanks and that's so....

346
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,922
What? Too soon?
Is that what you're thinking?

347
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,426
We have been going out for, Iike, a minute.

348
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,761
Fuck that shit. I don't want to pIay games.

349
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,266
I'm just trying to own my feeIings.

350
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,603
I Iove you. I said it.

351
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:24,069
Mr. Casey, you do not Iove me...

352
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,276
...you Iove you, not drinking, with me.

353
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,280
No, I Iove you.

354
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,588
I'm so fIattered...

355
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,054
...but I think maybe we shouId
sIow down a IittIe here.

356
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,650
What does that mean?

357
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,761
It means that things
are going very fast and....

358
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,801
You have these new feeIings
because you're not drinking--

359
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,765
No, don't give me that program buIIshit.

360
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,432
This has nothing to do with drinking.

361
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,699
I Iove you.

362
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,169
Maybe we shouId spend a IittIe time apart.

363
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,315
I'II caII you tomorrow.

364
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,843
-I'm not coming up?
-Just a coupIe of nights.

365
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,189
Are you breaking up with me? 'Cause if--

366
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,851
I'm not breaking up with you.
I'm just going inside.

367
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,226
CaII me tomorrow.

368
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,991
We'II do something next week, okay?

369
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,266
What am I going to do now?

370
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,631
You shouId go to a meeting.

371
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,300
And then go home, and caII me tomorrow.

372
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,543
Goodnight.

373
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,338
I'II see you next week.

374
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,644
Go.

375
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,722
Get yourseIf some cookies.

376
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,034
Meanwhlle, across town at Charlotte's....

377
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,331
My God, what are you doing?

378
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,329
My God.

379
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,272
You are good. Sweet Christ!

380
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,045
You are good!

381
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,481
Charlotte consldered lt the best 50 bucks
she'd ever spent.

382
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:21,792
It cost Mlranda a llttle more, but across
town ln her bed, thlngs were good as well.

383
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,564
CarrleI

384
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,017
What are you doing?

385
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,022
Fuck you, you bitch!

386
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,484
Shit!

387
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:58,357
I Ioved you and you didn't Iove me.

388
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,932
You fucking made me date you...

389
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,757
...before the month and now I'm drunk.

390
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,698
And I don't care!

391
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,366
I Iove you!

392
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,778
I Iove you!

393
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,809
Make Iove to me!

394
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,381
What are you doing?
Don't take your cIothes off.

395
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,050
My flrst lmpulse was to go down
and rescue hlm...

396
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:28,592
...but as I learned on our second date,
that would be codependent.

397
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,454
Stlll, I felt I had to do somethlng.

398
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,762
Here, put this on, you'II get a coId.

399
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,326
I hope I fucking die!

400
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,938
Quiet, asshoIe, I'II caII the cops!

401
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,997
Shut the fuck up, dickweed!

402
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,039
Carrie!

403
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,811
You were the best fuck I ever had!

404
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,675
Three weeks later,
I got a letter from Patrlck...

405
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:55,912
...saylng he was back ln the program
and wanted to make amends.

406
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,852
I never saw hlm agaln
but I always wondered two thlngs.:

407
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,788
Was he able to stay sober?

408
