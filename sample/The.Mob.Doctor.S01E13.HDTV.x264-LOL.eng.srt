00:00:02,273 --> 00:00:05,082
<i>As long as you're in Chicago,</i>
<i>I own you. That's the deal.</i>

3
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:06,842
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:07,943
Did you kill my dad?

5
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:10,780
I swear to you
I did not kill your father.

6
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:12,548
Who the hell is this guy?

7
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:13,549
It's me, dad.

8
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:14,850
What do you need?

9
00:00:14,885 --> 00:00:18,154
The money I borrowed
belongs to the Nogales Cartel.

10
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:19,355
You're in a lot of trouble.

11
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:21,023
I floated the message
to the cartel

12
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:22,525
that you're willing to pay off
Luke's debt.

13
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,060
There's something you're not
telling me, Al.

14
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:25,661
They've already taken
punitive measures.

15
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:26,829
They've ordered a hit on Luke.

16
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:34,537
Trapani lied about the cartel.
There is no truce.

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,675
Trapani never even passed on
your offer to pay Luke's debt.

18
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:43,980
If they find out
you killed their man

19
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:47,583
without trying to negotiate,
this is going to get ugly fast.

20
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:48,618
Where's Constantine?

21
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,724
Help!

22
00:00:54,758 --> 00:00:58,728
Somebody, help!

23
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:00,329
Help!!

24
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:02,531
- Watch your back.
- Get out of the way.

25
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:05,901
58-year-old male,

26
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:08,371
multiple gunshot wounds
and unresponsive.

27
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:09,538
All right, this is where
we take over, folks.

28
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:11,007
We'll take it from here.

29
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,708
He's hypotensive
to 87 systolic.

30
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:14,377
Expanding hematoma.
Must have nicked the carotid.

31
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,245
Pressure's down to 55.

32
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:17,747
We need to tie off his artery
right now.

33
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:20,182
Move him. 3, 2, 1.

34
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:24,920
Hang two bags... O-neg.
Suction.

35
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:26,923
54-year-old female with gunshot
wounds to the thigh and shoulder.

36
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:28,891
Heart rate's 130.
GCS is 6.

37
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:30,126
Be right back.
Take over.

38
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,895
- Grace.
- It's my mom.

39
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,564
She's lost at least
2 liters of blood... B-positive.

40
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,899
Recurrent loss
of consciousness.

41
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,201
All right, stop.

42
00:01:38,235 --> 00:01:40,102
First, we got to move her,
get her hooked up.

43
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:43,406
On my count.
3, 2, 1.

44
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,441
I got your page.

45
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:47,777
Dr. Robinson,
Mrs. Devlin is your patient.

46
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:49,879
She got bullet wounds to her chest and thigh.
What do you want to order?

47
00:01:49,913 --> 00:01:51,447
Chest, hip, and femur films.

48
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,615
Type and cross for four
and prep an O.R.

49
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:53,883
- Come on, mom.
- You need to get cleaned up.

50
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:55,885
- No, I'm not gonna leave her.
- You need to go.

51
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,720
I'm sure the police
want to talk to you.

52
00:01:57,754 --> 00:01:59,155
Right now,
this is how you help your mom.

53
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,123
We need to get him to the I.R.,
stent his carotid.

54
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:02,725
Gonna be a long night.

55
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,393
Excuse me, doctor. I need
you to sign the run sheet.

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,008
Clear here.

57
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:20,776
Pack the gauze.

58
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:23,346
Scalpel.

59
00:02:36,226 --> 00:02:37,927
Nate, it's me.

60
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:40,796
Grace.

61
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:43,132
Somebody shot up the bakery.

62
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,002
What? It was like a
fricking massacre.

63
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:50,673
Gus, Gio, Stavos...
They're all dead.

64
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:52,441
Why are you
answering Constantine's phone?

65
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:55,878
He's here at the hospital.
So is mom.

66
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:57,213
Mom?

67
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:59,148
There was a drive-by
at the house.

68
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:00,816
They were both hit.

69
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,619
Mom is going into surgery.
You need to get here.

70
00:03:03,654 --> 00:03:04,620
I'm on my way.

71
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:21,737
Dr. Devlin?

72
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:22,872
Agent York.

73
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:24,407
I'm sorry to
hear about your mother.

74
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:27,210
I spoke to the paramedics.

75
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:29,512
He said you were there when she
was shot. Did you see anything?

76
00:03:29,546 --> 00:03:30,746
No, I-I was inside.

77
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:33,149
I heard gunshots,
and then I-I raced outside.

78
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:35,151
Did you see or hear
a car speeding away,

79
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:37,320
anything that could
help the investigation?

80
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:38,554
No, I'm sorry.
I need to go.

81
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:41,724
Dr. Devlin, we believe that
Constantine Alexander

82
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:42,725
was the target.

83
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,093
An hour before he was shot,

84
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:46,062
at least four of his men
were killed at his workplace.

85
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:47,897
It seems the shooter
was looking for him,

86
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:50,299
and one of his own men
pointed him to your house.

87
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:53,069
I-I really...

88
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:55,938
I understand you manage
Mr. Alexander's diabetes.

89
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:57,607
Yeah, that's right.

90
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:59,675
Had he mentioned if
anyone had threatened him,

91
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,344
either personally
or professionally?

92
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:04,013
No.

93
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:07,817
I need your cooperation here.

94
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:11,487
Wh-when we're together,
we talk about

95
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:13,055
his blood sugar levels
and his diet.

96
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,724
That's it.

97
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:16,759
What about your brother Nate?

98
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:19,929
What about him?

99
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:22,999
We both know Constantine
took Nate under his wing.

100
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:30,439
My mother is being
prepped for surgery right now.

101
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:32,108
Will you excuse me?

102
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,718
Suction.

103
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:48,558
Bone fractured distal
to the greater trochanter.

104
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:50,259
Side biter.

105
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:55,131
Grace.

106
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:56,833
Your brother's here.

107
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:07,243
How's your mom?

108
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:09,579
Well, they transfused
four units,

109
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,647
but, uh,
pressure's still borderline.

110
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:13,649
What does that mean?

111
00:05:13,684 --> 00:05:16,486
The doctors
are repairing the damage,

112
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,354
but the bleeding
is still a problem.

113
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:19,655
Is she gonna be okay?

114
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,825
I don't know.

117
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,020
Hey.

118
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:52,289
That took longer than
it should have. What happened?

119
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:53,490
I mean,
if you hadn't been there,

120
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:54,558
she probably wouldn't
have made it this far.

121
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:55,960
You really
slowed the blood loss.

122
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:57,628
She's in critical condition.

123
00:05:57,662 --> 00:05:59,797
Her femoral artery
was punctured.

124
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:01,899
We stabilized the fractures
and repaired the artery.

125
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,968
Well, that all sounds good.

126
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:05,636
Yeah, it's just,
with this kind of injury,

127
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,405
the 24 hours after surgery
are pretty critical.

128
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,307
I'm not leaving the hospital
until she's stable.

129
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:11,742
If you need anything, I'm here.

130
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:13,744
Thank you.

131
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:17,748
It's ironic, isn't it?

132
00:06:17,783 --> 00:06:18,749
What is?

133
00:06:18,783 --> 00:06:20,918
The two of us
doing all this work

134
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:24,922
to save the life of
a known killer.

135
00:06:24,956 --> 00:06:26,390
Don't hold back, doctor.

136
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:29,059
This man spent years in prison,

137
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:32,730
cost taxpayers hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

138
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:34,899
Now that he's out,
who knows what he's up to?

139
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:38,402
My guess...
he's not selling bibles.

140
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:41,238
Constantine Alexander
is our patient,

141
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:42,740
and he's in critical condition.

142
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:45,409
Our job is to
get him out of it alive.

143
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:47,411
Of course.
I wasn't suggesting otherwise.

144
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:50,781
I was merely
pondering the reality...

145
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:51,882
Watch your catheter.

146
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:53,284
You don't want to
break through the wall.

147
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:54,652
It's in position.

148
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:56,954
Deploying the stent.

149
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:02,960
All right.
Stent's in good position.

150
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:04,195
Bleeding is stopped.

151
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:06,363
Of course,
I can't help but wonder

152
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:09,600
how his shooting
reflects on our hospital.

153
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:10,935
Excuse me?

154
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:12,703
Our patient was found

155
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:15,706
shot on the doorstep
of Dr. Devlin's home.

156
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,375
I don't have to
spell it out for you.

157
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,044
No, you don't.

158
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:22,747
But perhaps
you should find a hospital

159
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:25,649
where the doctors
are more to your liking.

160
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:28,652
I'm just saying
what everyone else is thinking.

161
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:32,156
And I think you've done
enough pondering for the day.

162
00:07:35,393 --> 00:07:38,629
The Nogales Cartel...
that's who shot mom?

163
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:40,464
I think so.

164
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:43,401
Constantine killed their guy
after he came after Luke.

165
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:46,504
- Luke?
- Constantine's son.

166
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:49,673
Right.

167
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,742
So going after Constantine
was payback?

168
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:53,210
Looks like it.

169
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:56,113
Constantine stopped by
our house. Do you know why?

170
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:59,483
All right, you got to
stay away from him.

171
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:03,587
An FBI agent was just here

172
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:05,589
asking me questions about him,

173
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:07,091
and then he asked me about you.

174
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,593
Me?

175
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:11,328
Yeah, they're keep tabs
on his organization,

176
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:12,997
including me and you.

177
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:14,932
Grace.

178
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,701
How's she doing?

179
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:19,236
The same.

180
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:20,771
Constantine
made it through I.R.

181
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:22,440
He's being prepped
for the O.R. now.

182
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:24,408
Thanks.

183
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:26,077
You text me
if anything changes...

184
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,912
If she wakes up, anything?

185
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:40,357
Is your mom okay?

186
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:46,030
I'd like to scrub in
on Mr. Alexander.

187
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:47,598
Dr. White,
I can't just do nothing.

188
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:50,301
I understand.

189
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:52,236
But not today, Grace.

190
00:08:53,905 --> 00:08:55,706
This man
was shot on your doorstep.

191
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,875
You two know each other.

192
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:59,744
I'm his doctor.

193
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:02,046
His doctor?

194
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,981
I treat his diabetes.

195
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:05,182
It only makes sense that

196
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:06,984
I'm involved in
his treatment here.

197
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,855
Only if I were to okay it,
which I'm not gonna do.

198
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:14,625
You think I don't notice

199
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,961
all your
mysterious disappearances

200
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:21,899
and your unusual patients?

201
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,508
I turn a blind eye
because I care about you

202
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:34,612
and it was easier
not to ask questions.

203
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:38,983
Now that your life
has so publicly

204
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:42,787
found its way
into my hospital, my O.R.,

205
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:45,122
I can't allow it.

206
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:46,223
Not anymore.

207
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,728
Constantine Alexander
is my patient.

208
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:51,962
You'll stay away from him.

209
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:14,986
I heard
your mother's in recovery.

210
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,754
That's great news.

211
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:19,357
Thanks?

212
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:26,163
Nate, you and I
want the same thing...

213
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:28,265
To catch whoever
shot your mom.

214
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,868
It's probably the same
person or persons

215
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:33,571
who shot up
Constantine Alexander's place.

216
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:35,072
Do you have any leads?

217
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:37,842
The bullets we recovered
from both crime scenes

218
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:40,544
are Aguila 9mm
from Centurion Arms.

219
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:42,880
You know who uses those?

220
00:10:42,914 --> 00:10:44,048
No idea.

221
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:45,750
The Nogales Cartel.

222
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,852
I never heard of them.

223
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:51,021
Nate, I know
you work for Constantine.

224
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:53,357
The blackmail, insurance scams,

225
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:56,761
the extortion of
the bars on Pilsen Street.

226
00:10:56,795 --> 00:11:00,064
Yeah, I heard
you were keeping tabs on me.

227
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:01,999
You heard that?
From who?

228
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,238
It doesn't matter.
You can't prove anything.

229
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:09,073
Actually, I can.

230
00:11:09,107 --> 00:11:13,811
And it all adds up...
20 years behind bars.

231
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:22,119
If you help me
with this investigation,

232
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:25,122
it all goes away.

233
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:27,058
Think about it.

234
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,804
Grace, I came soon as I heard.

235
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,973
How's your mom?

236
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:43,474
Uh, she's in recovery.

237
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:44,942
And Constantine?

238
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:46,610
Surgery.

239
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:48,412
Don't you worry.
He's gonna pull through.

240
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:52,550
He's a real tough guy.
The toughest guy I know.

241
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:57,054
But you know that
better than anyone, huh?

242
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:58,623
What do you mean?

243
00:11:58,657 --> 00:12:02,960
It's okay, Grace.
I know what he did for you.

244
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:05,329
Sorry? What...
What he did for me?

245
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:08,799
To protect you and your mom
when you were a kid.

246
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:11,469
I was there when Constantine
took care of business...

247
00:12:11,503 --> 00:12:12,737
Quick, decisive.

248
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:15,406
Your deadbeat dad
never saw it coming.

249
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,010
If you ask me,
after what he did to you guys,

250
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:20,778
I think he got off lucky.

251
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:23,781
You just keep the faith, Grace.

252
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:25,750
Constantine will be fine.

253
00:12:25,784 --> 00:12:27,018
I'll call you later, huh?

254
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:38,946
I just work here. How would
I know anything about the shooting?

255
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,958
You're friends
with Dr. Devlin.

256
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:43,460
I have a lot of friends.

257
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:44,528
Actually, I don't,

258
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,796
but that doesn't
really matter here.

259
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,132
Look...

260
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,134
I know Grace is a good person

261
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:52,136
and she's only involved with
the outfit on the periphery.

262
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,439
But right now,
she's not thinking clearly.

263
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:57,508
As a friend,
tell her to talk to me.

264
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,501
Why would I do that?

265
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:03,047
Because I can protect her
or I can prosecute her.

266
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,484
Ms. Quintero,
help me help your friend.

267
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:11,889
I got to get back to work.

268
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:15,859
Just one more question...

269
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:18,462
What can you tell me about
Grace and Franco Leoni?

270
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:20,831
There's nothing to tell.
They broke up years ago.

271
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:23,133
So they used to date.

272
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,304
The bureau appreciates
your cooperation.

273
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,885
Grace, I think I screwed up.

274
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:19,557
That FBI guy cornered me

275
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:21,158
and asked me a bunch
of questions about you.

276
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,860
What did you say?

277
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:25,829
I kind of mentioned
you and Franco used to date.

278
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,966
He caught me off guard.
I'm so sorry.

279
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:33,370
Look, um...

280
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:37,041
Whatever happens to me,
just know that I love you

281
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:39,310
and I-I never meant to

282
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:40,411
take your friendship
for granted.

283
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:43,147
Please, please,
don't talk like that.

284
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,517
Is Constantine
out of surgery yet?

285
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,786
Yeah, about an hour ago.
Why?

286
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,554
I-I just need to
talk to him.

287
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,456
Is that the smartest thing
for you right now?

288
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,325
Probably not.

289
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,863
The men who did this to me,

290
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,199
the ones that murdered
my friends in cold blood...

291
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,235
They're gonna pay for this.

292
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:10,040
This all happened
because of me.

293
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,709
I'm so sorry.

294
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:14,378
Don't blame yourself.

295
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:18,249
You're my son,
and I would do it again.

296
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,751
Come here.
I want to tell you something.

297
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,755
Grace.

298
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,460
Hi.

299
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,297
You're Grace Devlin.

300
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,133
I'm Luke.

301
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,469
Nice to meet you.

302
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:42,006
Uh, may I
talk to Constantine alone?

303
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:49,780
So, is your mother all right?

304
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:52,316
She's in critical condition.

305
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,485
Don't worry...
she's gonna pull through this.

306
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,421
She's a strong woman.
Trust me.

307
00:15:57,455 --> 00:15:59,924
Why, 'cause you've always
been so trustworthy?

308
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,493
What does that mean?

309
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:05,329
You know, my father was
an abusive drunk.

310
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:08,165
He destroyed my family.

311
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,368
And you have managed to hurt me
more than he ever did.

312
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,504
You can't mean that, Grace.

313
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:16,173
Al Trapani just came by.
He thought I knew.

314
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,509
He told me he was there
when you did it.

315
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:19,677
When I did what?

316
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,145
When you killed my father.

317
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:24,682
And you believe him?

318
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:29,320
Just for once
be the man you pretend to be.

319
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:32,323
Spit it out.

320
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:34,458
I mean, you got something
to say, just get it out.

321
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,827
I was 6 years old
when I saw your car pull away,

322
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,996
and I convinced myself
that it wasn't you.

323
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:42,566
You got it all wrong, Grace.

324
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,736
Oh, my God. Stop it.
Just stop.

325
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,507
I didn't kill your father.
I couldn't have.

326
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,209
And why is that?

327
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,579
Deep down, you know why.

328
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,583
Your mother,
she never wanted you to know,

329
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,186
maybe with good reason.

330
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,524
But love me or hate me,

331
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,359
I'm your father.

332
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:10,528
That's the reason why

333
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,196
I was
at your house last night...

334
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,398
To finally tell you.

335
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:25,009
Mr. Alexander...
how are you feeling?

336
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:28,345
Better, doc.

337
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,082
Dr. Devlin,
why are you here?

338
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:39,089
His phone, um,
dropped in the E.R.

339
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,958
I was just returning it.

340
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:44,061
And saying goodbye.

341
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:52,861
Ah.

342
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,232
Ma.

343
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:55,888
Ma.

344
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,088
Hi.

345
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,518
Hey.

346
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,745
Hey, Grace.

347
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:07,081
Hmm.

348
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:08,716
How you feeling?

349
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:12,554
I've been better, but...

350
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:14,055
I'm a survivor...
You know that.

351
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:27,201
- Ma.
- Huh?

352
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:29,704
Constantine
just told me something...

353
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:37,846
About you and him...
and me.

354
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,016
Oh?

355
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:46,421
He told me that...

356
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:52,527
He told me that he's my father.

357
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:57,498
Yeah, right. I mean, he probably
hit his head when he got shot.

358
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:08,910
Come on.
That's not true.

359
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:13,284
I was married to Alan
for two years.

360
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:18,910
He was very cruel,
and I was so lonely.

361
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:22,157
But...

362
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:25,660
When I found out
I was pregnant with you...

363
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:27,762
You lied to dad?

364
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:29,197
I had to, Nate.
He would have killed us.

365
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:31,132
You know that.

366
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:35,270
He died years ago, mom.
Why didn't you tell us after?

367
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:40,609
H-how do you t-tell somebody
something like that?

368
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:43,211
I didn't
want to hurt you, Grace.

369
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,716
You know,
when I found him dead,

370
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,417
I, uh...

371
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:53,989
I thought
something was wrong with me.

372
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:57,692
I mean,
what 6-year-old girl is glad

373
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:59,527
when their father is murdered?

374
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:00,996
What?

375
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,465
And now I find out
he's not even my dad.

376
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:05,166
Oh, Grace.

377
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:09,371
I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna get some air.

378
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:11,439
I'm so...

379
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:16,378
Grace, I'm so sorry.

380
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:22,918
Did a great job, doc.
You saved my life.

381
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:25,086
So, how's it look?

382
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:29,257
The carotid stent
is functional.

383
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:33,094
You should be out of here
in a couple weeks.

384
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:42,737
I wanted to talk to you
about Dr. Devlin.

385
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:46,174
Sure. Go ahead.

386
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,880
You're gonna
ruin her career... or worse.

387
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,721
I know who you are,
I-I know what you do,

388
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:05,193
and I-I know about your...
arrangement.

389
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:07,862
So you know who I am,

390
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:09,798
and yet
you talk to me like this?

391
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,870
You care about Grace,
don't you?

392
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:18,039
Well, don't worry
about her, doc.

393
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:20,175
I'm not gonna
let anything happen to her.

394
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,843
The only way that works

395
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:24,546
is if you leave her
the hell alone.

396
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:33,388
I'll be back
to check on you later.

397
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:46,434
Hello?

398
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:48,770
Grace?
Oh, thank God.

399
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:50,772
Franco, I thought you said

400
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:52,274
it wasn't safe
for us to contact each other.

401
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:53,942
Uh, it's a disposable phone.

402
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:56,645
I heard about the drive-by.
It's all over the news.

403
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,281
Yeah, my mom and Constantine
were hit, but they're alive.

404
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:00,582
Are you okay?

405
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:02,150
I'm not hurt.

406
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:05,754
That's not what I'm asking.
Are you okay?

407
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:09,557
Not really.

408
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:11,593
Look, there's
something you need to know.

409
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:12,928
Agent York was here,

410
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:14,429
and he's been
questioning everybody.

411
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:16,398
And Ro let it slip
that we used to date.

412
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:18,566
That's not good.

413
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:21,169
How long before he figures out
you've been covering for me?

414
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:24,172
All right, listen to me,
all right?

415
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:25,273
Now, if he comes to you,

416
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:26,975
you can't let him
catch you in a lie.

417
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:31,313
You got to remember
the three most powerful words...

418
00:22:31,347 --> 00:22:32,480
"I don't know."

419
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:35,650
Say it.

420
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:37,152
I don't know.

421
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:38,854
Good.

422
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,191
I can't handle this.

423
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:44,693
Yes, you can.

424
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:45,861
Yes, you can, you just got to

425
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:48,263
focus on getting through today,
all right?

426
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,765
Okay.

427
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,102
I miss you.

428
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:59,107
I miss you, too.

429
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,491
I should know these things.

430
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:18,660
I don't want any of this
to change

431
00:23:18,694 --> 00:23:22,430
the way you feel about me...
about Grace.

432
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,469
Alan was my dad, though, right?

433
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:30,105
Of course he was.

434
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:32,757
Oh.

435
00:23:38,414 --> 00:23:41,349
I forgive you.

436
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:45,220
And Grace will, too,
when she's done freaking out.

437
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:53,194
All right, I'm gonna go
find Grace and calm her down.

438
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:58,700
Mom? Mom! Mom, are you okay?

439
00:23:58,734 --> 00:23:59,768
Get a doctor!
Help! Help!

440
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:02,037
Someone, I need help!
My mom needs help!

441
00:24:10,813 --> 00:24:12,747
Grace, where have you been?!

442
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:14,749
They paged a code blue
on your mom.

443
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:17,586
They're working on her now.

444
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,588
Mom!

445
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:21,256
Give me the paddles.
Grace, stop.

446
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,625
I need two amps of bicarb.
Give me the paddles!

447
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:25,360
Hey, she went
from v-fib to asystole

448
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:26,528
and never had a rhythm
after that.

449
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:27,529
Did you try vasopressin?

450
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:30,532
She threw a lipid embolism.

451
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:33,168
There was nothing we could do.

452
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:40,242
I'm really sorry.

453
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:41,409
She's gone.

454
00:25:04,215 --> 00:25:05,415
Hey.

455
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,391
I've been looking for you.

456
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,834
We were just... talking.

457
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:28,671
And then...

458
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:30,874
Out of nowhere...

459
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:43,319
Sometimes,
when a long bone shatters,

460
00:25:43,354 --> 00:25:46,656
it, uh...

461
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:51,661
It showers pieces of the marrow
throughout the body.

462
00:25:51,695 --> 00:25:54,831
And one of those pieces
got lodged in her lung.

463
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:57,901
So her doctors screwed up.

464
00:25:57,935 --> 00:26:00,036
No. It's just not
that easy to predict, you know?

465
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:03,206
That's why the 24 hours
after surgery are so critical.

466
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,208
God, Grace.

467
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:06,910
Shut up.

468
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:10,447
Mom's dead.

469
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:29,099
Nate...

470
00:26:32,002 --> 00:26:35,411
The things I said to her
were really ugly.

471
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,746
And she died
thinking that I hated her.

472
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:53,957
Grace...
mom knew you loved her.

473
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:56,960
That's... that's what
we were talking about,

474
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:58,895
right before...

475
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:01,398
She knew.
I promise you... she knew.

476
00:27:01,432 --> 00:27:02,932
I just went after her.

477
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:04,434
You know,
I didn't think about it.

478
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:05,935
I just was so mad.

479
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,872
You had a right to be angry.

480
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:20,550
I'm not angry at ma, though.

481
00:27:23,254 --> 00:27:26,389
There's something
I have to do, okay?

482
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:46,843
Grace...

483
00:27:46,877 --> 00:27:51,114
I'm so sorry
to hear about your mother.

484
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:53,416
The last thing
I would have ever wanted

485
00:27:53,451 --> 00:27:56,786
was for Daniella to get hurt.

486
00:27:56,821 --> 00:28:00,256
Well, she was.

487
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:02,782
And all of it,

488
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:07,163
the blood and the...
the bodies,

489
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:08,999
it all goes back to you.

490
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:11,334
Don't do this.
Please, just listen.

491
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:15,004
I let myself believe
there was something good in you,

492
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,006
and I was wrong.

493
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm gonna tell the FBI
everything I know.

494
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,984
I just don't care.
It's over.

495
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:29,652
Fine.

496
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,722
I won't stop you
if that's what you want to do.

497
00:28:32,757 --> 00:28:37,027
But just know Stavos
left me this message yesterday.

498
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,529
I didn't get it
until you gave me my phone.

499
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:40,563
Listen.

500
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:42,365
<i>We have a problem.</i>

501
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,370
<i>Trapani lied about the cartel.</i>
<i>There is no truce.</i>

502
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:50,874
<i>Trapani never even passed on</i>
<i>your offer to pay Luke's debt.</i>

503
00:28:50,908 --> 00:28:52,275
<i>If they find out</i>

504
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:54,344
<i>you killed their man</i>
<i>without trying to negotiate,</i>

505
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:56,513
<i>this is going to get ugly fast.</i>

506
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:01,851
An hour after
he sent me this message,

507
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:06,523
he and half my crew
were gunned down... executed.

508
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:09,559
It was Trapani who set me up.

509
00:29:09,593 --> 00:29:11,561
He didn't
negotiate with the cartel.

510
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:12,996
He sent the cartel.

511
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,997
Why would he do that?

512
00:29:14,031 --> 00:29:15,231
Why do you think?

513
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:18,568
He saw an opportunity
to seize power, and he took it.

514
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:21,204
Why do you think
he told you about me?

515
00:29:21,238 --> 00:29:24,707
Trying to
drive a wedge between us.

516
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:29,379
Grace, the cartel
may have pulled the trigger,

517
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:31,881
but Al Trapani
is the one who's responsible

518
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,416
for your mother's murder.

519
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:37,120
And if you want the bloodshed
to end and you want justice,

520
00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:39,689
then you and me
are gonna have to take him down.

521
00:29:44,595 --> 00:29:47,564
What would I have to do?

522
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:50,066
No way.
That's insane.

523
00:29:50,101 --> 00:29:52,802
You're the only one who can
contact the Nogales cartel

524
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:54,471
without involving Al Trapani.

525
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:56,139
Yeah, of course
they'd like to hear from me,

526
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:57,907
so they can
find me and kill me.

527
00:29:57,942 --> 00:30:00,243
All I'm asking you to do
is use your Miami contacts

528
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:03,780
to set up a meeting
between me and Tiago Enriquez.

529
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:06,283
He's cartel's
lieutenant here in Chicago.

530
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:08,585
This is crazy. Why do you think
this guy will even meet you?

531
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:11,121
Because I'm authorized to
speak for Constantine.

532
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,126
'Cause I'm his daughter.

533
00:30:19,355 --> 00:30:20,832
So you know.

534
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:30,440
Will you make the call?

535
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:32,942
Grace, I'm just a real-estate
guy who screwed up.

536
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:35,111
-I shouldn't even be here.
-And I'm a surgeon.

537
00:30:35,146 --> 00:30:36,680
We're both out of our element.

538
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:40,250
I am asking you to help.

539
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:45,288
How can I say no to my sister?

540
00:31:03,207 --> 00:31:06,343
What's that?

541
00:31:06,377 --> 00:31:07,944
Grace Devlin's phone records.

542
00:31:09,613 --> 00:31:11,915
So?

543
00:31:11,949 --> 00:31:14,751
Looks like you two are
a lot closer than I thought.

544
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:16,753
Until you left town
a month ago,

545
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:18,655
you spoke several times a day.

546
00:31:18,689 --> 00:31:20,156
The calls are highlighted.

547
00:31:20,191 --> 00:31:22,158
She's Constantine's doctor.

548
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:24,194
I was gaining her trust.
She has his ear.

549
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:25,895
Cut the crap, Franco.

550
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,898
You used to date.
Isn't that right?

551
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:30,400
Yeah, a long time ago.

552
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:31,501
You just failed to mention it?

553
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:32,836
It wasn't relevant.

554
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,804
It ended
the day I was recruited.

555
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:38,341
You told her she was
being investigated, didn't you?

556
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:40,844
You lied to me, Franco.

557
00:31:40,878 --> 00:31:42,679
She's not just
Constantine's doctor.

558
00:31:42,713 --> 00:31:43,980
She's under his thumb,

559
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:46,216
and she aided and abetted
outfit activity.

560
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:50,553
I don't know.

561
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:58,428
Okay.

562
00:31:58,462 --> 00:32:00,497
Well, then,
let me tell you what I know.

563
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:04,668
I know you still
got the hots for Dr. Devlin

564
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:07,837
and I know you two
started up again recently.

565
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:10,173
She helped me with
my investigation. That's it.

566
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:13,176
Then how do you explain
CSU finding her fingerprints

567
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,846
all over your safe house...

568
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:20,350
You know, the motel room
the bureau set you up in

569
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:22,185
before you took off?

570
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:25,588
I'm reporting you to
the Attorney General's office.

571
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:28,758
They're gonna press charges.

572
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:30,860
I need your gun and your badge.

573
00:32:45,576 --> 00:32:49,512
If you're going after Grace,
you're wasting your time.

574
00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:54,017
Well, that's not
your call to make.

575
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,668
I checked the back parking lot.
There's no sign of him.

576
00:33:11,702 --> 00:33:13,003
He's late.

577
00:33:13,037 --> 00:33:15,014
We're not in a rush.

578
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:18,008
When I told him we wanted to
meet at the police station,

579
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:19,642
he didn't seem too happy.

580
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:21,811
Yeah, well, we need to be safe.

581
00:33:21,846 --> 00:33:24,281
You're sure he listened
to Stavos' message?

582
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:26,283
Yeah, it's the whole reason
he agreed to meet.

583
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:31,721
Here we go.

584
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:41,798
Mr. Enriquez,
I'm Grace Devlin.

585
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:45,302
Constantine Alexander's
daughter?

586
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:46,736
That's right.

587
00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:51,841
And this piece of crap
is Constantine's son?

588
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:53,944
Yeah.

589
00:33:53,978 --> 00:33:57,113
Al Trapani...

590
00:33:57,148 --> 00:33:59,950
Seems he played me
against Constantine.

591
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:01,718
Is your father
as pissed off as I am?

592
00:34:01,752 --> 00:34:03,153
Yeah, that's why we're here.

593
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:07,824
What do you propose
we do about it?

594
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:12,329
Constantine is willing to
forgo retaliation

595
00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:13,964
and give you free access to

596
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:16,032
the West Side
Eisenhower Expressway.

597
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:17,033
It's worth millions.

598
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:18,368
It's not his to offer.

599
00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:20,870
Al Trapani
controls the expressway.

600
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:23,373
In exchange,
you'll agree to a truce

601
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:24,808
and you'll forgive Luke's debt.

602
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:27,844
You'll take the hit off of Luke,
and you'll put it on Trapani.

603
00:34:38,956 --> 00:34:40,924
And you're telling me
Constantine's got enough juice

604
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:44,027
to take over the West Side
from his hospital bed?

605
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:46,830
Well, he owns enough aldermen
to shift city council votes.

606
00:34:46,864 --> 00:34:48,632
He's got enough
soldiers on the street

607
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,333
to crush anyone
who won't play ball.

608
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:52,335
And the CPD
will turn a blind eye,

609
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,738
thanks to every cop
he's got in his pocket.

610
00:34:54,772 --> 00:34:56,573
If I agree to this

611
00:34:56,607 --> 00:34:59,075
and Constantine
doesn't keep up his end,

612
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,710
we'll come after
the both of you.

613
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:02,879
You understand?

614
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:05,382
You have my father's word
and mine.

615
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:08,385
It's done.

616
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:11,554
Not yet.

617
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:13,423
Which one of you
shot my mother?

618
00:35:19,997 --> 00:35:22,866
Now we're done.

619
00:35:38,496 --> 00:35:40,313
Does the patient need Insulin?

620
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:43,850
No, his sugar levels are fine.
I just gave him a sedative.

621
00:35:43,884 --> 00:35:45,285
Can we have a moment, please?

622
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:47,320
Of course, doctor.

623
00:35:55,896 --> 00:35:57,831
So, what happened?

624
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:01,835
It's done.

625
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:03,503
Enriquez will take care
of Trapani

626
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,071
in exchange for the Expressway,

627
00:36:05,106 --> 00:36:06,573
and Luke will get a free pass.

628
00:36:06,607 --> 00:36:10,243
Okay.

629
00:36:10,277 --> 00:36:13,413
That'll give us
the breathing room we need

630
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:16,049
until we're
ready to make our move.

631
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,322
What do you mean,
"ready to make our move"?

632
00:36:25,126 --> 00:36:26,760
What do you think?

633
00:36:26,794 --> 00:36:30,096
Why don't you tell me?

634
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:32,932
After the ambush, the cartel...

635
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:35,535
they could have
taken everything away from us.

636
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:39,672
We had to trick them into
a sense of security.

637
00:36:39,707 --> 00:36:43,343
All war is deception, Grace.

638
00:36:43,377 --> 00:36:47,013
And a war with the cartel
is one we can't lose.

639
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:52,018
But we're not losing
'cause we're not fighting.

640
00:36:52,053 --> 00:36:53,686
That's the deal we made.

641
00:36:53,721 --> 00:36:56,690
There is no deal.

642
00:36:56,724 --> 00:36:59,526
There never was a deal.

643
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,030
It's all a tactic, an illusion.

644
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:07,233
You used me?

645
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:11,071
Well, if you knew the plan,
you wouldn't have done it.

646
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:12,739
And there is nobody
that could have

647
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:15,675
pulled this off like you,
Grace... nobody.

648
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:21,081
I don't want any part of this.

649
00:37:21,115 --> 00:37:25,752
You don't have a choice.
Don't you see?

650
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:30,990
You're my blood, my family.

651
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:34,761
What is in me is in you.

652
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:40,967
I'm tired now.

653
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:42,569
I need to rest.

654
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,943
I'm gonna need all my strength
for the fight ahead.

655
00:39:55,236 --> 00:39:56,202
Nate.

656
00:39:56,237 --> 00:39:58,371
Grace.

657
00:39:58,406 --> 00:40:00,040
How's Constantine?
Is he okay?

658
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:02,809
Yeah, he's...
He's doing good.

659
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:04,110
Can I see him?

660
00:40:04,145 --> 00:40:08,715
Oh, he's...
He needs his rest right now.

661
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:16,122
I'm done.

662
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:17,991
Yeah?

663
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:21,227
Constantine,
the organization...

664
00:40:21,262 --> 00:40:23,096
I don't want
anything to do with it anymore.

665
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:29,970
What about you?

666
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:36,610
I made my decision
a long time ago.

667
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:43,750
I love you.

668
00:40:43,784 --> 00:40:45,552
I love you, too.
