1
00:00:03,093 --> 00:00:05,427
Oh, Cece. Are you two kids
back together?

2
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:07,947
- She wishes.
- No, plumbing's out-- severe clogging.

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:09,649
- I'm sorry I asked.
- This is what happens.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,651
Four models with
protein deficiencies,

5
00:00:11,702 --> 00:00:13,435
sharing a shower.
(Laughs)

6
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:16,786
They shed like a... like
a four-dollar Christmas sweater.

7
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:18,607
Guys, guess what?

8
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:22,327
I just made a breakthrough
with a student.

9
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:23,579
Yeah, it's true.

10
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:25,131
(Humming)

11
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:26,849
- Don't, please.
- Uh, Jess?

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,986
You know we love you,
we all support you...

13
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:33,455
♪ I'm breaking through
with students. ♪

14
00:00:33,473 --> 00:00:36,806
...but when you do things
like this, I'm sorry... bowl.

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,894
Okay.

16
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:43,683
It's just not satisfying.

17
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:44,850
- I think it is.
- Okay.

18
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:46,352
You said you had
a breakthrough.

19
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:48,320
It's just a whole new world
teaching adults.

20
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:49,605
This week, I gave
them an assignment.

21
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:51,357
I said write whatever you want

22
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:54,210
just load it up
with descriptive imagery.

23
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:55,611
MAN:
My fluffy pillow,

24
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:57,363
my yellowy fluffy pillow,

25
00:00:57,414 --> 00:01:00,747
next to my dog, my hairy dog,
my beloved hairy dog,

26
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:02,317
while I diddle myself.

27
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:03,185
Excellent.

28
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,954
He was a merman.

29
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:07,723
He was the last of his kind,

30
00:01:07,758 --> 00:01:11,091
and he needed a mother
for his mer-child.

31
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:14,894
He was not a mer-gentleman.

32
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:19,168
Can't wait to hear more.

33
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:21,070
I just can't connect with them
and I don't know why.

34
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:23,022
Look, Jess, you can't teach
people how to write.

35
00:01:23,056 --> 00:01:25,007
- Not true.
- I say that as a writer.

36
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:27,176
- Also not true.
- A writing class is for

37
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:28,811
somebody who doesn't think
lyrically in terms of,

38
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:32,178
like, poetic words
that just... are strung...

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,034
You said you had
a breakthrough.

40
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:36,368
So I have this student
whose name

41
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:38,304
is Edgar
and he was not getting it.

42
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:39,355
And then today

43
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:41,023
he turned in this amazing story.

44
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:42,975
Nick, actually,
you should read this.

45
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:45,144
Writers don't read--
we write.

46
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:47,196
Jessica Day calls it
"A must read."

47
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,597
Look at that font.

48
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:50,699
What is this amateur hour?

49
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:53,202
At least use Palatino.

50
00:01:53,236 --> 00:01:54,236
WINSTON:
Good evening, everyone.

51
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,771
Or should I say morning?

52
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,540
Hey, Winston.

53
00:01:57,574 --> 00:01:59,107
Do you guys have any agave?

54
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:00,442
We might have some
pressed lentil syrup

55
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,110
in the mixin's cabinet.

56
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:05,047
Thank you.

57
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:10,619
- Oh, my goodness.
- Okay, uh...

58
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:11,921
- Okay, you know what?
- Hey, look...

59
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:13,288
I just felt the
side, the side

60

Other way, now.

63
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:19,762

- No, not again.

Not... no!

65
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:24,366
- No!
- Jump out the way, Jessica?

my parts.

120
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:02,014
You practically
shish-kebabbed her.

121
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:03,498
Is this something
I should apologize for?

122
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:04,666
Just let it go, man.

123
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:06,835
You pogo'd her.

124
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:08,888
I'm sorry,
what did you say, "pogo"?

125
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,223
- I didn't, um...
- I heard

126
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:13,008
"Pogo" -- what is that?

this morning, okay?

131
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:21,200
It's a short...
it's a shorthand.

132
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:22,201
Why do you have
a shorthand, Schmidt,

133
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:23,202
because it happens so often?

134
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:24,653
You pogo'd me once.

135
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:26,688
- You pogo'd Jess twice.
- Hey, it's not sexual.

136
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:28,324
Nick's never been
pogo'd directly.

137
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:30,709
You did get his pizza one
time... which, by the way,

138
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:32,378
is a whole nother debate--
how did you not feel that?

139
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:33,528
Let me get this straight--

140
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:34,663
you guys sit around
and talk about this?

141
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:36,081
Your penis actually
changed the channel,

142
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,200
uh, when we were watching
the Bears game once.

143
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:39,201
You don't think
me, Nick and Jess

144
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,252
talk about you behind your back?

145
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:41,337
Because we do.

146
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:42,704
You have more pogos than anyone.

147
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:44,840
You are completely
misusing the word pogo.

148
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:47,709
You are the pogo king.

149
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:52,431
Pogo king. (Laughs)

150
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:54,500
Pogo king?

151
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,635
So I wanted to talk about your
creative imagery assignments.

152
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,871
Wow, guys.

153
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:01,807
I really felt like I was buried

154
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,760
under a giant, gleaming, powdery

155
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:06,461
avalanche of adjectives.

156
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:09,982
Don't mean to interrupt,
I just hear you're the best

157
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,017

- Oh, no.

158
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:13,669

room for one more? - No!

I'm Julius Pepperwood.

160
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:17,373
- Not now, okay?
- I'm an ex-cop, ex-Marine.

161
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:19,425
I'm here to learn how
to write short fiction.

162
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,043
Oh, okay, Julius, just...

163
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:22,244
take a seat and, um,

164
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,262

So, for a fun follow-up...

169
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:31,437
- Sorry, I'm late.
- No, problem, Edgar.

170
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:33,138
(Mouthing)
We're just going over our

171
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,257
- descriptive imagery.
- I'm sorry, dear,

172
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:36,591
I can't hear you.
Mr. Pepperwood?

173
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:38,777
I'm gonna move closer,
if you don't mind.

174
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:39,928
No, you don't have to go...
stay over there.

175
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:40,980
How you doing, pal?

176
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:42,781
- I'm Julius Pepperwood.
- Edgar.

177
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:44,696
What are you doing?
If you don't mind me asking,

178
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:46,151
why are you late
today, Edgar?

179
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:48,320
Uh, traffic, it
really killed me.

180
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:50,406
- It killed you?
- Mr. Pepperwood.

181
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,457
Would you say that
it stabbed you?

182
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:53,242
Say that again?

183
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:54,397
How about glasses on or off?

184
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:55,444
Teach, if I keep them on,

185
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:57,429
- am I a bad boy?
- Hey.

186
00:05:57,464 --> 00:05:59,465
All right, honey,
I'll take them off.

187
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:02,832
Whoa, that's a whole different
lens to see that blue dress.

188
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:05,671
No.

189
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:06,955
Okay, let's refocus.

190
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:09,425
Um, let's talk
about the, um,

191
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,677
four classifications
of conflict.

192
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:12,961
We talked about it
last week.

193
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:15,097
It's in the workbook, um...

194
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:17,149
Anybody want to help me?

195
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:18,150
Four classifications
of conflict?

196
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:19,735
Anybody?
Anybody...

197
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:24,786
So, no one has signed up for
office hours and I just want

198
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,790
you to know that you can talk
to me about anything.

199
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:29,060
<i>- Adios.</i>
- Anything at all.

200
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:32,730
What are you doing?

201
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:35,183
Nothing, man, you look
good in your Dockers.

202
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:37,818
What? Nothing happened.
I'm Julius Pepperwood.

203
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:38,936
Let it go.

204
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:42,323
Whoops.

205
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:44,025
- Why did you do that?
- The wind.

206
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:49,247
(Quietly): No, no,
no, no, no, no.

207
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:52,450
Is everything all right?

208
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:54,535
Yeah, everything's good.
Oh, everything's fine, bro.

209
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:55,670
What's happening right now?

210
00:06:55,704 --> 00:06:57,872
Sorry, Edgar,
um, I really

211
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,924
loved your story.

212
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,008
Um, I wanted
to give you

213
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:02,293
some notes-- is there any time

214
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:03,767
you could come in...
to office hours?

215
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,429
Yeah, that be really cool.

216
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:06,547
I'm really excited.

217
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:08,216
Um, I'm available anytime, so...

218
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:09,767
- I'll check my calendar.
- Yup.

219
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,219
Can't get service around here.

220
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,500
Wednesday I got to go
to the bird store.

221
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:19,477
Uh, what about
Wednesday afternoon?

222
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:21,279
He's my uncle.

223
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:24,899
Hey, Winston,
I'm glad you're home.

224
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,534
I know what my pogo is.

225
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:28,569
It's that I dance kind
of like a sea snake.

226
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,958
(Hissing quietly)

227
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:35,326
Yeah, not even close, Schmidt.

228
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,545
What are you talk...
I know this it, man.

229
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:40,798
Is it that I barge
into people's showers?

230
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:43,551
It's my caterpillar
eyebrows-- well, look.

231
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:45,386
(Whooshes)
(Screams)

232
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,837
They're gone.

233
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:49,774
Nick, you've gone way too far!
Way too far.

234
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,275
Well, if you're here for Edgar's
notebook, you're too late.

235
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:53,811
Where's the notebook?

236
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:54,996
Nick!

237
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,198
What's my one rule?

238
00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:58,833
It's to not steal your yarn.

239
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,601
Don't steal my yarn, man.

240
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:01,953
It's my one thing.

241
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:03,821
But look at what was
inside of his notebook.

242
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:05,606
Okay, he was doodling
in class, Nick.

243
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,224
Weapons, dripping
with blood?

244
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,659
That is not a doodle.

245
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:09,977
What are you, the doodle police?

246
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:12,113
(Snickers)

247
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:14,115
- There's no doodle police, are there?
- Really?

248
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,783
I can't believe you
still don't believe me.

249
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,068
Jessica...

250
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:19,069
Exhibit D.

251
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:21,739
He did this.

252
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:23,624
I'm going to Edgar's house,
I'm looking for more proof.

253
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,075
No, Nick, you're not spying
on the one student

254
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:26,460
that I have a connection with.

255
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:27,832
- I have the address right here.
- No.

256
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,580
- Give me the...
- No!

257
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:31,682
- I have the address memorized.
- Fine, then I'm coming, too.

258
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:35,050
To bail you out of jail when you
get arrested for trespassing.

259
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:38,022
- Fine, then you'll see
that I was right. - Fine!

260
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:40,975
And you'll also see
who gets there first.

261
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:42,760
Maybe we should take one car.

262
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:44,528
Just, like, for the environment.

263
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:45,730
Yeah, that makes sense--
we can drive together.

264
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:47,448
- Fine!
- Fine!

265
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,486
It's my mole, isn't it?

266
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:53,654
Well, consider it gone.

267
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:55,539
Game, set, pogo.

268
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:56,991
Chill out, man,
it's not your mole.

269
00:08:57,042 --> 00:08:58,492
Just tell me,
this is the worst.

270
00:08:58,543 --> 00:08:59,610
This is not the worst,
Schmidt-- the worst

271
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:01,111
is actually knowing.

272
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,446
Knowing that your friends

273
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:03,664
sit around every single night

274
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:05,282
talking about your pogo.

275
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,785
What's a pogo?

276
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:09,253
Those brows don't freak you out?

277
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:10,554
Nah, I've seen worse.

278
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,223
A pogo is what
your friends talk about

279
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:13,341
when you leave the room.

280
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:14,975
Oh, like your barnacle toenails?

281
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:22,016
Uh... sh...

282
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,234
You guys talk about my toenails?

283
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:25,302
(Laughs) Never...

284
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,239
talk about
your toenails, Sch... Schmidt.

285
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:31,525
I know my toenails
are a little rugged.

286
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:32,743
Woodsy.

287
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:34,478
I mean, I have never wondered

288
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:36,580
if you could shimmy up
a palm tree.

289
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:39,083
But it's because I have a
keratin surplus, I mean...

290
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:41,285
They're not that bad,
look at these things.

291
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:42,319
- Aah! Schmidt!
- Ew!

292
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:44,154
It looks like an open
Swiss Army knife.

293
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:46,257
Most of them are hard, but one
of them is really, really soft.

294
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,659
I know, I know, I know-- we'll
just talk about what my pogo is.

295
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:49,677
What's my pogo?

296
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:51,662
Is it the way I say "pan"?

297
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:54,098
Pan, pan, pan.

298
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,050
Look, Cece, this is more
of just a loft thing.

299
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:58,002
Just thank your lucky stars
that you don't have

300
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:59,053
calcified mongrel toes!

301
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:01,739
(Toenails clicking on floor)

302
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:03,941
Things sound like
a dang ol' crab.

303
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,811
NICK:
There it is.

304
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,512
If anything's gonna go down,
we need a safe word.

305
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,232
Nothing's gonna go down
unless we make it go down.

306
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:13,684
- If Pepperwood taught me anything--
- There's no Pepperwood.

307
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:17,021
Never get caught
without a safe word.

308
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:18,622
We're gonna go with "apricot."

309
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,023
That's way too normal.
We need to, like,

310
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,293
go with something weird,
like "dragon slippers."

311
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:24,628
- What?
- I use "apricot" too much in my normal life.

312
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:27,131
Why do you use
"apricot" so much?

313
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:29,333
What am I supposed to call
them-- "sweet tangy balls"?

314
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,253
Don't call them "sweet
tangy balls," Jessica.

315
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:34,037
Well, that's why
we can't use...

316
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:37,388
Nick... Nick...

317
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,093
Nick, oh!

318
00:10:40,144 --> 00:10:41,929
(Whispering):
Shh! Come on...

319
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,348
- Nick..
-  Call me Julius Pepperwood, please.

320
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,183
You look ridiculous.

321
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:47,852
If we're hiding
from people,

322
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:49,553
- why does it matter what I call you?
- I got my eyes

323
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:51,555
- and you get my six.
- No, no, what does this mean?

324
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,524
- I'm pretty sure this...
- This means "right turn bicycle."

325
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:55,025
- No, I'm pretty sure this means "stop...
- " It means "right turn."

326
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:57,027
Nick, seriously--
use your words.

327
00:10:57,061 --> 00:11:00,364
- Don't use freaking SWAT sign language.
- Okay, these are my words.

328
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:01,449
(Door opens)
NICK: Oh!

329
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,700
Apricot, apricot,
apricot.

330
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:05,235
Close your mouth,
close your eyes.

331
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:11,509
Edgar lives with his mother.
Of course he does.

332
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:13,344
So? A lot of normal people
live with their mothers.

333
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:15,412
Like my Uncle Randy.

334
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,548
- He can't go near parks.
- He was cleared.

335
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:19,467
You've got to...
(Vehicle approaches)

336
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:20,718
(Shrieks) Apricot! Apricot!

337
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:24,085
Get over here now!

338
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:33,931
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

339
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:37,785
What's in that duffel bag?

340
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:41,271
He's the plumber
from the story.

341
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:42,873
- How did I not see this before?
- What was I saying?

342
00:11:42,908 --> 00:11:45,159
- Oh, my God, you were right.
- Yes, say that again,

343
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,911
- say that again. You were right, you
were right, you were right about everything.

344
00:11:46,945 --> 00:11:48,996
- Don't ever forget you're saying it!
- Oh, my God,

345
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:50,548
- I can't believe you were right.
- I was a right about everything!

346
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:52,883
What the hell is in
that duffel bag?

347
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:55,753
- I don't know.
- No, Nick.

348
00:11:55,787 --> 00:11:57,505
- Nick, you're gonna get us killed.
- Let's get down.

349
00:11:57,556 --> 00:12:00,007
Nick... Nick...

350
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:02,343
Shh.

351
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:04,795
(Ringtone):
♪ I'm so excited...

352
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,964
Oh, my... Jessica,
turn it off.

353
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:09,963
- Turn it off! Oh, my God, it's Edgar.
- What do I do?

354
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:10,901
You turn it... Here.

355
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:13,470
- Turn it off. I don't know
how to do this.    - Okay.

356
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:14,855
(Ringtone stops, door opens)

357
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:16,807
Oh, my God. Get the
hell out of here.

358
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,782
Jess, what are
you doing?

359
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:27,084
That is ridiculous.
There was plenty of room.

360
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:28,035
It seemed like
a good idea.

361
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:29,454
Why would you
go under a van?

362
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:31,005
Let's leave.

363
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:35,723
WINSTON: Keep still...
You will not believe what just happened.

364
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:37,492
- Nick was right.
- I was right.

365
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:38,743
Oh, my God, what happened
to your eyebrows?

366
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:40,528
You look like Audrey Hepburn.

367
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:41,863
Don't we own an
industrial-size paper cutter?

368
00:12:41,897 --> 00:12:43,998
- Ugh! (Gasps)
- Oh, whatever.

369
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,700
- What the hell is that?
- So close to the eating area!

370
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:47,869
Winston told me that you guys
make fun of my gremlin toenails.

371
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:51,236
That you call them "clickety-
clacks" or "centaur boots."

372
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:52,874
What is wrong
with you, Winston?

373
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:56,241
What <i>is</i> wrong with me?
Besides my pogo.

374
00:12:57,345 --> 00:12:58,946
I told him.
It just kind of popped out.

375
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:00,215
You understand what
that's like, right, Winston?

376
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:01,716
Okay, you know what?
Don't act like

377
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,301
we don't talk about you two
behind your backs.

378
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:05,887
Because we do. You both have
pogos, my friends.

379
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:08,139
Okay, let's take a deep breath
and ask ourselves

380
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,843
if this conversation is worth
ruining our friendships over.

381
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:14,229
Tell me my pogo.

382
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:15,980
I need to know my pogo.

383
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:19,364
You guys need to tell me.
I can take it. Lay it on me!

384
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:21,319
You know, it's kind of a loft thing.
Is it my pies?

385
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,821
Are they too tart?

386
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:24,455
Pies can't be a pogo, okay?

387
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,457
My koala claws,
now that's a pogo!

388
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:27,959
At least you can hide
your pogo in a shoe.

389
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:31,496
They make shoes for your penis--
they're called pants!

390
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:32,914
- Tell me my pogo.
- Jessica, no.

391
00:13:32,948 --> 00:13:35,383
- Tell me my pogo!
- You're a know-it-all!

392
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:36,634
- Huge know-it-all.
- The worst.

393
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:39,554
Oh, I'm the worst
know-it-all in the world?

394
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:42,921
Please. Hate hyperbolic
speak. Please.

395
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:45,693
Now you know your pogo,
you truly know it all.

396
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,111
There I go
being a smart-ass again.

397
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:48,913
I mean, that, that
could be my pogo.

398
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:50,532
And then there was one.

399
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:52,617
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sure
that you guys have stuff

400
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:54,419
you laugh at me
behind my back.

401
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:55,753
We don't laugh about
your pogo, Nick.

402
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:57,905
Yeah. We're worried about you.

403
00:13:57,923 --> 00:13:59,390
You're worried about me?

404
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:00,708
We're worried that you're
not gonna make it.

405
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:03,044
- Make it to what?
- Just in general.

406
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:04,078
'Cause you don't take
care of yourself.

407
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,046
Sometimes I'll crumple up
vitamins

408
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,548
and I'll put them in your food.

409
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:09,100
We all take turns sneaking
money into your pants pockets

410
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:11,436
before we put them
in the dryer.

411
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,555
Yeah? Well,
I hope you're happy.

412
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:14,806
The pogos are out.

413
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,190
The loft dynamic
is ruined.

414
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:21,229
(High voice): But what
if I talk like a baby?

415
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:23,214
You're still hot. That's all
we're gonna talk about.

416
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:24,816
A tiny little baby!

417

00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:02,506
- Ah...
- Your son's a really great writer.

519
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,373
- He's not my son.
- Oh! Are you kidding?!

520
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,373
Really?!

521
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:09,412
EDGAR:
Real nice, you two.

522
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,381
Come here, baby.

523
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,618
Mm! God, you smell
like waffles.

524
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:17,004
I love it. Did you just
make some waffles?

525
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,022
- Want to eat me up?
- Yes, I do.

526
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,358
I'll meet you inside.
I'm gonna get the duffel bag.

527
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:23,377
- Yes, do.
- Okay.

528
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:27,381
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey.

529
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:28,532
What are you doing up?

530
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,883
Just taking care of myself.

531
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,252
Are you putting butter on bacon?

532
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:33,703
I don't want it
to stick to the pan.

533
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:36,590
Okay, did you...?

534
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,393
Great.

535
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:41,395
It's just what bacon needs,

536
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:43,647
more fat.

537
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:45,566
And salt.

538
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,401
- What's this?
- Don't read that. I'm not finished...

539
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:50,768
"Julius Pepperwood:
Zombie Detective"?

540
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,656
All his murder victims
are already dead,

541
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,759
so they obviously don't need
a detective. I'm working on it.

542
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:58,011
- "The night was inky hot."
- Don't do this.

543
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:01,298
"She strode into his office with
a sense of purpose, place,

544
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,567
another word here,
question mark."

545
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:04,968
I'm looking for another
"P" word there.

546
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,104
"She had zombie legs
that went on for miles.

547
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:10,107
"They were the kind of legs
you could sink your teeth into.

548
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:13,991
"Pepperwood had two friends--
one, if you count his hat.

549
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:16,894
The other was his gal Friday,
Jessica Night."

550
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:20,534
It's not you, Jess.

551
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:23,003
"She was small in stature,
but not in spunk.

552
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:25,789
And a super annoying
know-it-all."

553
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,341
Good evening.

554
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:31,077
Hello.

555
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:32,546
Oh, bacon.

556
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,746
Where the hell
did you come from?

557
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:35,682
I came from my room.

558
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:38,135
No, I didn't hear the pitter-
patter of your disgusting feet.

559
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:40,353
I cut my toenails.
Yeah, the soaking really worked.

560
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:41,471
Look at that.
They're gorgeous now.

561
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:44,090
- Went down a full shoe size.
- Guys! Fire!

562
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:45,425
- Whoa, whoa!
- Oh, my God!

563
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,027
Everybody relax!
Call a fireman!

564
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,612
- You call the fireman!
- I'm the fireman.

565
00:20:49,764 --> 00:20:52,098
You can't put out a grease fire
with water!

566
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:53,482
You have to smother it!

567
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:55,417
Why didn't you say
that before?!

568
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:56,385
I don't want
to be a know-it-all!

569
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:58,254
- You're so stupid!
- Shut up!

570
00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:00,056
- Whoo! Oh!
- Nice!

571
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:01,157
Yes!

572
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:03,126
Amazing, my man! Whoa.
Whoa.

573
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:04,761
Honestly, I didn't know you were
gonna put your arm around me.

574
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:06,963
I'm so sorry.

575
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:09,665
Oh, you put up your pup tent
in front of the fire.

576
00:21:09,732 --> 00:21:11,499
WINSTON:
It's involuntary.

577
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:14,900
It is a combination
of adrenaline

578
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:16,772
and great circulation.

579
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,756
And I'd appreciate it if you
don't just hug me randomly!

580
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:20,275
That's weird and...!

581
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:22,477
(Schmidt laughs)

582
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:25,345
You ever notice...
when Winston runs,

583
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:27,882
- that he kinda farts while
he's running?      - Yes!

584
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:29,016
(laughs)

585
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:30,350
- Sounds like a jalopy.
- New pogo.

586
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:32,586
Oh, we got a great
new pogo!

587
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:34,614
He farts when he runs!
(Jess makes farting sounds)

588
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:41,791
