Get up! Stand up!

Stand up. Stand up.
Stand up. Come on!

00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:28,690
Let go of me!

Stand up! Hey!

(jet engine whining)

00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,666
I don't care
how you do it.

10
00:00:38,668 --> 00:00:40,752
Issue a shipwide
announcement if you have to.

11
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:43,154
Just find him.
Aye, Master Chief.

12
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:48,343
Officer on deck.

13
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:51,162
As you were.

14
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:53,131
With me, Chief.

15
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,682
I understand
we had a situation

16
00:00:54,684 --> 00:00:56,467
in the Enlisted Galley
this morning.

17
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,053
I'm sure they were just
letting off a little steam, sir.

18
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:00,555
The crew's probably
a little stressed

19
00:01:00,557 --> 00:01:01,940
from the
extended mission.

20
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:04,859
Oh, you and I both know
that's no excuse, Master Chief.

21
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:07,111
If they're stressed now,
what the hell are they going

22
00:01:07,113 --> 00:01:08,646
to be like
in a combat situation?

23
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:10,732
I want to read
the NCIS report.

24
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:12,951
That makes two of us, sir.

25
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,539
We still can't find
the Special Agent Afloat.

26
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,709
Find him.

it would be fun for the kids

Yes. It sounds wonderful.

No.

Yes!

56
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,964
No, no, nono, because I have
chosen not to do anything.

57
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:08,349
It was not by default.

58
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:11,235
I have made a conscious choice
not to do anything on Christmas.

Also known as step one

Lake Tahoe.

Ski-in, ski-out cabin.
Six feet of fresh powder.

Snowboarding during day,
roaring fire at night.

64
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:24,332
I don't think so.

00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:28,319
Excuse me?

67
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:30,154
At snowboarding?

68
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,590
just know it takes a lot
of coordination.

69
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,759
Maybe we could get you,
like, a toboggan.

70
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:36,511
I can snowboard.

71
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:38,179

I don't need a bunny hill.

double-black-diamond rated.

There is no doubt in my mind

78
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,473
that that is
double-black-diamond rated.

79
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:50,674
Plus, I told my mom
I'd spend Christmas with her.

80
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:52,009
Well, then, she should come.

81
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:53,561
It's a three-bedroom cabin.

82
00:03:53,563 --> 00:03:54,979
Two of which are connected.

83
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,197
Don't even think about it.

84
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,899
For your mom.
Ew!

85
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:59,784
And you, so you guys
could have adjoining rooms.

86
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:00,952
What are you thinking?

87
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:02,019
Nothing.

88
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:04,205
I bet you were.

90
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,295

give my mom a little vacation.

91
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:13,197
And what's better
than a white Christmas?

92
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,216
Just the three of us,
hanging out...

93
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:16,367
sipping hot cocoa,

94
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:20,638
watching the snow fall
on the cedars.

95
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:23,874
From the hot tub.
Oh!

96
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:25,543
You had to go there.
What?

97
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:26,544
She's a stone-cold fox.

98
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:27,645
You ruined it!
I didn't.

99
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,564
I made it better.
Didn't I, Nell?

100
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,382
Hetty needs you guys up in Ops.

101
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,217
Great.

102
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:38,055
Hetty needs you guys up in Ops.

103
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:40,491
Okay, we'll be right there.

104
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,860
Can I help you with something?

105
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:44,895
You could, if he knew
what he was looking for

106
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:45,997
or where he put it.

107
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,398
(sighs)

108
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,783
I didn't want
to go through that whole

109
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,168
Parker Pony thing
like I did last year,

110
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,702
so I asked my daughter
what she wanted

111
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:53,337
for Christmas in June,
and then I went out

112
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:54,756
to buy it right away.

113
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,624
He hid it
so she wouldn't find it.

114
00:04:56,626 --> 00:05:01,245
Of course, as we know,
the memory is the first to go.

115
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:04,549
I think it had something
to do with Harry Potter.

116
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:05,967
A wand?

117
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:06,934
No.

118
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:07,935
How about an owl?

119
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:09,270
No.
No?

120
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:10,354
A sorting hat?

121
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:11,355
A what?

122
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:12,356
A broom?

123
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:13,441
You're not helping.

124
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,926
Eh, I'm not really trying.

125
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:18,563
CALLEN:
Who we looking at, Eric?

126
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:21,365
Jason Niles was the NCIS
Special Agent Afloat

127
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:22,817
on the <i>USS Van Buren.</i>

128
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:24,602
He was discovered
dead yesterday.

129
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:27,121
Cause of death was
blunt force trauma,

130
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:29,940
either from a fall or a
deliberate bludgeoning.

131
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:31,775
Any witnesses?
No.

132
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:32,877
Suspects?

133
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,412
Possibly one.

134
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:37,715
Petty Officer Simon Allen is
an intelligence specialist.

135
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:39,884
Now, according to
Agent Niles's last report,

136
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:41,952
he was keeping an eye
on Petty Officer Allen

137
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:43,905
for "erratic behavior."

138
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:46,624
What does that mean?
Well, he doesn't specify in his log

139
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:50,261
but Petty Officer Allen
is currently in the brig

140
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:52,730
following an altercation
with a Marine staff sergeant

141
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:56,133
on the same morning
that the body was found.

142
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:57,518
What were they fighting about?

143
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,736
Not sure.

144
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:01,939
But both men tested
positive for cocaine use.

145
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:03,107
Where's the <i>Van Buren</i> now?

146
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:05,026
It's on its way to
the Sea of Japan

147
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:06,777
to keep North
Korea in line.

148
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,696
So then, what are
we supposed to do?

149
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:10,865
HETTY:
What you do best.

150
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,201
Solve the crime.

151
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:18,172
I've already arranged for you
all to be flown out to the ship.

152
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:21,792
Christmas is
going to have to wait.

153
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:36,482
Wow.

154
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:37,584
Hello, sailor.

155
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:40,503
I'm a Marine major.

156
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:41,738
You're a major hotty.

157
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,107
Oh. Those are some
cool costumes.

158
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:46,576
Uniform.
They're not costumes, Deeks.

159
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:49,596
We're going in as crew members,
and Callen's going in as

160
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,598
the replacement
for the NCIS Agent Afloat.

161
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,216
Mm-hmm. So what's my cover?

162
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:54,684
KENSI:
You, my friend,

163
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:57,187
are a civilian contractor
doing a computer upgrade.

164
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,439
DEEKS:
A geek?

165
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:01,141
This is all I get?
This, like, clipboard?

166
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:03,526
There are over 5,000
people on board.

167
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:05,779
Going in as different
elements of the crew

168
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:07,447
will allow us to
cover more ground.

169
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:10,150
Mm-hmm. Just for the record,
this is a gross misuse

170
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:11,484
of my undercover talents.

171
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:15,322
Well, if you truly
feel that way, Mr. Deeks,

172
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:18,158
you can go in
as a Marine, as well.

173
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,126
All right.
Just let me get

174
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:21,911
my clippers.
What?

175
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:23,079
Clippers?

176
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:24,297
Ooh, you're gonna look so good

177
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:25,298
with a high and tight.

178
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,416
No, no. No, no, no, no, wait.

179
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:27,801
Just got to do a little, uh,

180
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:29,753
sense memory work for my
undercover character, you know.

181
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:31,921
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

182
00:07:31,923 --> 00:07:33,056
Acting, ha!

183
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:35,392
Chopper's here
to take us to Coronado.

184
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:41,231
I know that look.

185
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,651
You're starting
to sound like my wife.

186
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:46,486
You know what they
say when your partner

187
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:47,854
starts sounding
like your wife?

188
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:49,022
Get a new wife?

189
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:50,657
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

190
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,075
See, that's the problem
right there.

191
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:53,559
You and I don't talk.

192
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:56,246
Communication goes, the
relationship is soon to follow.

193
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:57,530
Almost finished?

194
00:07:57,532 --> 00:07:58,782
Just about.

195
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:01,951
Look, I know you want
to be home for Christmas.

196
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:04,170
I've missed Christmas,
graduations, birthdays

197
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:06,506
and everything else
doing what we do.

198
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:08,625
Then what is it?

199
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,684
Sidirov.

200
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:21,304
What if he comes back
while we're away?

201
00:08:21,306 --> 00:08:24,107
Then Michelle will do
what she has to do.

202
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:26,309
Same is if
you were here.

203
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:28,945
Yeah. But I won't be.

204
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:30,113
Then we'll make this quick.

205
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:31,281
Besides, I guarantee you,

206
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:33,116
Sidirov isn't showing up
here anytime soon.

207
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:34,567
How can you be so sure?

208
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:38,555
Criminals take Christmas off
just like the rest of us.

209
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:40,039
Even the bad guys
don't like

210
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,875
being on the naughty list.

211
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:49,999
DEEKS:
<i>The Navy has a budget</i>

212
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:54,587
of $155 billion, and <i>this</i>
is the plane that they use?

213
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:56,950
C2 Greyhound-- 
workhorse of the sea.

214
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:57,842
Mm-hmm.

215
00:08:57,843 --> 00:09:01,227
Yeah, well, this horse needs
to be sent to the glue factory.

216
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:03,480
It's probably the safest plane
you'll ever fly in.

217
00:09:03,482 --> 00:09:05,131
Th-This is the
safe... Really?

218
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,684
Okay, explain to me, then,
why we're wearing helmets

219
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:09,102
and life preservers.

220
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:10,854
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but the only time

221
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:12,522
to wear a life preserver
is in the event

222
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:14,807
of a water landing.
So tell me, do they know something

223
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,159
that we don't know?

224
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:18,361
There is nothing
to be afraid of, Deeks.

225
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:20,530
What? I'm not.
I have hardened nerves of steel.

226
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:22,282
I just think it's
a little disconcerting

227
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:24,951
the back of the plane
opens like my garage door.

228
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:26,753
It's like
a flying tool shed.

229
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:28,288
Deeks?
Yeah?

230
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,589
I'm trying to sleep here.

231
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:31,491
Okay. Well,
I'll be sure to wake you up

232
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:32,625
when we crash into the ocean.

233
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:35,178
Hey, just try and relax,
Maverick.

234
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,662
Huh? Did you hear that?

235
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:39,599
I look a little <i>Top Gun</i>
in this thing, don't I?

236
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:51,227
Hey, I gathered a bunch
of disciplinary reports

237
00:09:51,229 --> 00:09:52,979
from the last several months.

238
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:55,014
Trying to find anyone
who might have a grudge

239
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:56,566
against Special Agent Niles.

240
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:58,735
That sounds good.

241
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,488
You okay?

242
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,990
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

243
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:06,859
Nell?

244
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:11,297
Nellie?

245
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,717
Nellster...

246
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,035
(quiet laugh)

247
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:19,305
It's just... I was
really looking forward

248
00:10:19,307 --> 00:10:22,041
to the holiday party
and the Secret Santa stuff.

249
00:10:22,043 --> 00:10:25,228
It's... it's stupid.

250
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:29,766
I don't think so.

251
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:33,052
I'm so... I just get
like this around the holidays.

252
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:36,523
'Cause I... I can't be home.

253
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:41,110
And it's like
these people we work with,

254
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:43,196
they become...

255
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:47,033
our surrogate family,
and they're not here right now.

256
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:49,035
They'll be back soon.

257
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:51,504
And you know what,
even if they're not,

258
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:55,625
I promise that we will have
a festive holiday celebration.

259
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:57,577
(laughs)

260
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,746
I mean, I've agreed
to wear an elf hat,

261
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:03,099
so...
And the ears?

262
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:04,934
I'm sorry, the what?

263
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:07,854
You have to wear the elf ears.

264
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:11,441
Um, I don't think I remember
you saying anything about any...

265
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:12,692
Oh, come on.

266
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:15,778
Hey, what's an elf
without ears, right?

267
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,447
Exactly.

268
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:28,908
MAN (over speakers):
Prepare for landing.

269
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:38,918
DEEKS: <i>Piece of cake!</i>
<i>I don't know what</i>

270
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,953
you guys were so worried about.

271
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:43,056
Welcome aboard the USS
<i>Van Buren,</i> ma'am, sirs.

272
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:44,557
I'm Petty Officer Smalls.

273
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,309
Can I point you in the right
direction, Commander?

274
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:47,727
No, I'm good, thanks.
Special Agent Callen,

275
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:49,646
would you like to be taken
to the NCIS office?

276
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,130
Actually, I'm headed
to the brig first,

277
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:52,348
but can find my way. Thanks.

278
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,767
You must be Mr. Colter,

279
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:56,653
the data entry systems analyst.

280
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:57,987
Well, you say "day-ta,"
I say data--

281
00:11:57,989 --> 00:11:59,989
I say we split the difference
and call it a date.

282
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:01,974
I'm the ship's
civilian personnel liaison.

283
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:03,326
I'll be your escort.

284
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:05,745
Someone should be here
to meet you momentarily, ma'am.

285
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:06,812
Thank you.

286
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:07,914
Fantastic.

287
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,282
(clears throat)

288
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:11,817
I don't know if you,
uh, overheard that,

289
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:14,170
but I have a, uh, escort.
(clears throat)

290
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:16,623
Fraternization is forbidden
on board, Deeks.

291
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,508
Wow, jealous much?

292
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:22,045
MAN:
Major Barret?

293
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:24,347
Please excuse
my tardiness, ma'am.

294
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:25,665
I'm Lieutenant
Abernathy.

295
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:26,832
Welcome aboard.

296
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,301
Thank you, Lieutenant.
(clears throat)

297
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:29,636
If you'll follow me,
I'll show you

298
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:31,137
to your berthing.
You can get squared away

299
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:33,005
before you muster on station.
Yes.

300
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:35,525
So what, they found
the missing link.

301
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:38,357
Are you coming,
Mr. Colter?

302
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,314
Oh. Colter, no.
Please call me Marty.

303
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:41,814
And I should
call you...?

304
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:43,533
Petty Officer Smalls
will suffice, sir.

305
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:44,901
(chuckles)

306
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,452
All right.

307
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:49,572
So, what were you and
Staff Sergeant Jefferies fighting about?

308
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:51,874
I don't know, sir.
It was stupid.

309
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:54,060
I mean, you know
what the Marines are like.

310
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:56,713
"Oorah" this and
"oorah" that.

311
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:58,131
Sometimes it just gets
a little tiresome

312
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:59,549
and you have to stand up to them

313
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:01,417
or else they walk around
like they own the place.

314
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,670
You two have a history?

315
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:04,754
Absolutely not, sir.

316
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:06,706
I couldn't
pick him out of a lineup.

317
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,391
He and his boys
were lipping off,

318
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:09,892
so I told them to shut it.

319
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:11,477
Next think you know,
he's tackling me.

320
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,646
Guess he figured he
had something to prove.

321
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:16,115
Did this fight have anything
to do with cocaine?

322
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:18,050
I can't speak
for Petty Officer Allen,

323
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:20,853
but I did not,
nor have I ever used cocaine.

324
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:22,989
Then how do you explain
your drug test?

325
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,774
It must be a
mistake, sir.

326
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,659
I'd gladly be retested.

327
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:28,911
Oh, so you test negative now
that it's out of your system?

328
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:30,913
It was never in
my system, sir.

329
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:32,865
I'm no angel,
Agent Callen,

330
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:35,785
but I'll take a lie detector
to prove I'm no drug user.

331
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:37,870
My father and my uncle
were Marines.

332
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:39,706
I would never disrespect
this uniform,

333
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:43,176
this ship or my family
by doing something so stupid.

334
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:48,598
What's your relationship with
the NCIS Special Agent Afloat

335
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,599
Jason Niles?

336
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:51,884
I never even knew

337
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:54,887
who he was until I heard
he was reported dead.

338
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:56,889
Yeah, I-I only
met him once.

339
00:13:56,891 --> 00:14:00,359
He intervened in an argument
I was having a few days ago.

340
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:01,978
What was the argument about?

341
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,947
It was music.
Some E3 was in the library

342
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:06,899
listening to music
with his headphones,

343
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:09,986
but he had the tunes cranked so
loud, it was bugging everybody.

344
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:11,937
Where were you yesterday

345
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:15,541
prior to the...
altercation in the galley?

346
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:17,493
Fire safety drills.

347
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:19,278
I had the morning watch.

348
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,963
Which ends at 8:00?
Yes, sir.

349
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:22,799
The fight took place
just after 9:00,

350
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,117
so what were you doing
for the hour in-between?

351
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:27,170
Uh, usually I would
jog around the deck,

352
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:29,088
but flight operations
were in full swing,

353
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,224
so I just walked
below deck.

354
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:34,560
Uh-huh. Why didn't you use
the treadmills in the gym?

355
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:38,648
I always feel like
a hamster on those things, sir.

356
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,066
Anyone see you?

357
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:41,851
Uh, yeah, sure,
lots of people.

358
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:44,987
Anyone see you around the...
zero-two-tack-

359
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:48,274
one-eight-two-tack-
six-tango section of the ship?

360
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:50,409
I-I can't be sure, sir.

361
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,645
Where exactly is that?

362
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:57,583
Where the body
was found.

363
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:02,839
The bull's-eyes
tell you where you are

364
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,458
Deck, frame, relation
to centerline and compartment.

365
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,293
Numbers increase
as you go aft.

366
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:09,595
Even numbers are port,
odd numbers are starboard.

367
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:12,131
Starbucks?
S-Starboard.

368
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:14,333
No, I mean, is there
a Starbucks on board?

369
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:16,552
Or a Coffee Bean?

370
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:18,371
Panda Express?
T.G.I. Fridays?

371
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:19,722
Froyo?

372
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,224
Enlisted Mess is

373
00:15:21,226 --> 00:15:22,441
on the second level.

374
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,510
The Dirty Shirt Room,
Wardroom One, is forward

375
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:25,895
on the O3 level.

376
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:27,730
Chief's Mess has
the best food,

377
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:29,365
but you have to be invited.

378
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:31,951
If you'll follow me
this way, Mr. Colter...

379
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:34,687
SMALLS (in distance):
Mr. Colter? Hello?

380
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:53,306
(sighs)

381
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:57,226
(camera clicks)

382
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:05,318
(grunts)

383
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,569
(camera clicks)

384
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,321
What's up there, sailors?

385
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:11,157
Nothing to see here.

386
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:19,999
What the... what?

387
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:30,843
MAN: What the hell are you doing?
Me? No. I was just...

388
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,461
(chuckles): I was just looking
for the bathroom.

389
00:16:32,463 --> 00:16:34,297
I got lost coming
around one of these corners.

390
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:35,965
I found myself in the basement
of the <i>Titanic.</i>

391
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,600
Seriously, I think
I just saw Kate Winslet.

392
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:40,219
She was naked.
You should check it... out.

393
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:41,587
(chuckles)

394
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:42,605
Hey, I see how this is--

395
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:44,473
you guys, uh,
want to haze the swabbie.

396
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:45,303
Here's the problem--

397
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:47,277
I'm a private contractor,
which means you can't

398
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:49,278
dress me up like a sea hag,
or whatever it is

399
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,230
you and your seaman
buddy here do for fun.

400
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:56,535
(grunting)

401
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:00,940
What the hell
is going on in here?

402
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:05,244
He was creeping around where
we found that NCIS agent dead, sir.

403
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,797
Sir, you know what they
say about criminals,

404
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,582
always returning
to the scene of the crime.

405
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:10,583
Yeah, except for Matlock,

406
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:12,498
I'm pretty sure no one
actually says that.

407
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:18,123
I'll take him from here.

408
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,476
(Deeks coughs, groans)

409
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:24,463
(Deeks groans)

410
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:26,565
They're gone.

411
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,935
(quietly): I just need...
Come on, Deeks,

412
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:30,903
pull your skirt down--
I hardly hit you.

413
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:34,407
(laughs) I know, I was...
I was just in character.

414
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:35,741
It's fine. I'm fine.

415
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,077
You've been on the ship
less than an hour,

416
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,363
and you're already in trouble.
Yeah, I know,

417
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:41,781
but I found evidence.

418
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:43,032
Special Agent Niles

419
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:45,418
was killed on
a different part of the ship,

420
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,620
and then his body
was dragged here.

421
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:06,275
NELL: <i>These are the sailors</i>
<i>who attacked Deeks.</i>

422
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:09,161
Both men have had minor
incidents while on shore leave,

423
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:10,830
but both occurred
before Agent Niles

424
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:12,248
was assigned to their vessel.

425
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,582
Does either man have
a connection

426
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:14,500
with Special Agent Niles?

427
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:15,885
Nothing we've
found so far.

428
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,387
Neither one was noted
in any of Niles' files.

429
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,973
However, one of the men,
Petty Officer Lambert,

430
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,809
worked in Intelligence
with Petty Officer Allen.

431
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,507
All right. See if there's
any other dots to connect.

432
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:28,532
On it.

433
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:31,100
So Deeks thinks
Special Agent Niles

434
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:32,635
was killed
elsewhere on the ship

435
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:34,670
and then dumped
where his body was found.

436
00:18:34,672 --> 00:18:36,605
The body showed signs
of massive blunt-force trauma

437
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:38,507
with a distinctive
wound pattern, but there is

438
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:40,142
nothing in the area
where we found him

439
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:41,694
that would account
for that sort of injury.

440
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:43,913
Well, it could've been done
by the weapon the killer used

441
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,165
or some other piece
of equipment he had on.

442
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,251
Except for the fact...
that I found this.

443
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,619
What is it?

444
00:18:50,621 --> 00:18:52,371
That, my friend, is spinach,
or Swiss chard,

445
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:53,873
possibly kale--
but I think it's spinach

446
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,324
because I nibbled it
a little bit

447
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:56,592
and it tasted like spinach.

448
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,345
Let me see that.
It's called detective work, boys.

449
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,764
Yeah, I see where
you're going with this.

450
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,050
Popeye ate spinach,
Popeye was a sailor, so...

451
00:19:05,052 --> 00:19:07,603
we're looking for a crew member
with giant forearms,

452
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,389
smoking a pipe.
Why, I oughta...

453
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:11,640
It could've
come off anyone's shoe.

454
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:12,858
Could' fallen
out of the trash.

455
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,677
That's true, except for--
wait for it--

456
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,347
this.

457
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:21,567
(quietly):
One and... two.

458
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:22,618
Okay.

459
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,370
Wardroom, messes.

460
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,687
This...

461
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:27,239
is where we found the body.

462
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:29,575
It's the other side of the ship.
Uh-huh, exactly.

463
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:31,710
So if you think about all
the passageways and the ladders,

464
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,747
it would be almost impossible
for <i>this</i> to get from one side

465
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:36,382
of the ship to the other...

466
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,751
without being scraped
off somebody's boot.

467
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:41,754
It would be improbable,
but not impossible.

468
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:44,590
What's impossible is to kill
somebody in the galley,

469
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:46,141
then drag the corpse
through the entire ship

470
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,142
without being seen.

471
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,310
Mm-hmm. How do you
account for that?

472
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,728
I don't have
to account for that--

473
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,380
I'm the one that
found the spinach.

474
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:52,815
What'd you guys find, huh?

475
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,716
More importantly,
what did Kensi find?

476
00:19:54,718 --> 00:19:57,403
Oh. Kensi found something.
Mm-hmm.

477
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,739
Yeah. Six-two and looks
like a male model.

478
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,891
That's right.
What?

479
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:04,910
That guy?
That guy's not her type.

480
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,780
He's a Marine.
Really?

481
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:09,832
Her father was a Marine.

482
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,333
Girls love their daddies.

483
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,701
Yep.

484
00:20:12,703 --> 00:20:13,519
Oorah.

485
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:16,789
(chuckles):
Okay. Good talk.

486
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,674
Do you know Staff
Sergeant Jefferies?

487
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:19,758
He's serving aboard.

488
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,677
I know <i>of</i> him, ma'am.
Why?

489
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,629
Oh, we're just from
the same hometown

490
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:25,097
and have mutual
family friends.

491
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,849
I was hoping
to say hello.

492
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,134
But, uh, I hear
he's in the brig.

493
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:32,054
I think he and one of
the crew got into a scuffle.

494
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:34,940
That doesn't sound like
the Jefferies I remember.

495
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,425
I'm sure it was nothing
serious, ma'am.

496
00:20:36,427 --> 00:20:37,860
By the end
of a long deployment

497
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,528
everybody's ready to get off
this ship, and having our mission

498
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,614
suddenly extended seemed
to shorten everyone's fuse.

499
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,182
(man yelling)

500
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,952
ABERNATHY:
Master Chief!

501
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,070
Master Chief.

502
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,405
(distorted grunt)

503
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:52,274
Let's talk
about this!

504
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:55,110
I need a security force
to the ready room.

505
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:58,547
Come on!

506
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:00,516
(grunting)

507
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:02,968
Down!
I need a security force

508
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,219
down here!

509
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,504
Don't touch that!
It's evidence!

510
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:07,473
Don't touch it!

511
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:10,309
The lab tested it.

512
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,562
No signs of Niles' hair,
blood, DNA, nothing.

513
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,431
They could've
wiped it clean.

514
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:18,150
Yeah, it also doesn't
match his head wound.

515
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,153
How's the master chief doing?

516
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,855
Still a little out of it.

517
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:24,306
What the hell happened?

518
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:26,442
The senior medical officer

519
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:28,661
believes that
his altered mental state

520
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,947
was caused by...
cocaine toxicity.

521
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,153
You're way out of line,
Mr. Callen.

522
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:39,654
It's "Special
Agent Callen""

523
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:41,373
I've known the
master chief for years.

524
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,275
I'll take his word
over yours any day.

525
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:45,928
How about the word of your
chief medical officer?

526
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,263
Drug tests don't lie.

527
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,598
No, but they can be wrong.

528
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,350
Then how do you explain
your master chief

529
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,968
attacking crew members
with a wrench?!

530
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,887
With all due
respect, sir,

531
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:57,172
your ship has a
serious drug problem.

532
00:21:57,174 --> 00:21:59,858
Oh, so first you try and tell me
I got a killer on board,

533
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,193
and now a bunch of drug addicts.

534
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,644
I'm not trying
to tell you anything.

535
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:04,897
The evidence...
Agent Niles could have fallen down

536
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:07,116
and hit his head,
for all I know!

537
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,367
All you have are allegations,

538
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,002
and if you're
gonna keep making 'em,

539
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:12,854
you sure as hell better have
something to back 'em up.

540
00:22:12,856 --> 00:22:17,376
Aircraft carrier is one of the
most dangerous places on the planet,

541
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,661
especially if you're
careless or stupid.

542
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:22,381
Now, you seem relatively
smart for a civilian,

543
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,500
so I'd suggest
you be careful.

544
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:26,668
(jet roars past)

545
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:35,811
Sorry I'm late;
I got hung up.

546
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,097
How'd you make out
with the XO?

547
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:40,215
Not as well as I'd hoped--
he basically threatened me.

548
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:41,433
You think
he's involved?

549
00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:42,518
Nah, I doubt it.

550
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,820
Can't blame the XO
for his behavior.

551
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,022
Everyone on board
is a reflection on him.

552
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:48,824
His career's
on the line.

553
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,993
Somebody smuggled
the drugs on board

554
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,244
and is now dealing.

555
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,529
NCIS Agent Afloat Niles

556
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:54,863
obviously came close
to finding out

557
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:56,782
who that is,
and it got him killed.

558
00:22:56,784 --> 00:22:59,418
It sounds like we got to lean
on those that tested positive.

559
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,902
Both of them
denied using.

560
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:02,838
Well, they usually do.

561
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,739
We need to search the ship.

562
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:06,074
You want to search this?

563
00:23:06,076 --> 00:23:08,076
That's like searching Cleveland.
This place is huge.

564
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:09,678
I didn't say
it would be easy.

565
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,630
But the act alone might
force whoever's behind this

566
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:13,882
to get nervous and make a mistake.
Okay. I'll ask

567
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:15,684
to be assigned
to the security search force.

568
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,803
I'll keep digging
through the 4,000-plus crew.

569
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:19,605
If I let those
in custody think

570
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,423
we're getting close
to finding the source,

571
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:23,609
they may start talking
to cut a deal first.

572
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,645
I'll keep working my lead.
KENSI: What's your lead?

573
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:28,781
Funny you should ask.
(clears throat)

574
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,202
What's this?

575
00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:31,734
That right there is
a little trace evidence

576
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:33,735
I found at the crime scene.
Spinach.

577
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:36,371
Or as I like to call it,
"forensic botany."

578
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,540
No, it's called spinach.
(whispers): Whatever.

579
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,243
It's difficult to stay
in touch on the ship,

580
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,996
so it's gonna be extra hard
to cover each other's back.

581
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:45,414
Let's be extra careful.

582
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,066
We already lost
one NCIS agent.

583
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:07,497
KENSI:
I'm gonna need you

584
00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:09,147
to level with me,
Lieutenant.

585
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:11,083
Is drug use a common
problem on this ship?

586
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:12,418
Not that
I'm aware of, Major.

587
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,753
The skipper runs a
tight ship, and dope's

588
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:16,839
a serious violation.
Well, how hard can it be

589
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:18,974
to sneak a little cocaine
onto a ship this size?

590
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:21,143
We only do random searches
around the clock,

591
00:24:21,145 --> 00:24:23,512
especially on those people
returning from liberty.

592
00:24:23,514 --> 00:24:26,515
Okay. How would you
explain what's happening?

593
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:28,717
Wish I had an
answer, Major,

594
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,269
especially for
the master chief.

595
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:32,638
He's probably one of the most
squared-away sailors

596
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,190
I've ever met.

597
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,526
(clears throat softly)

598
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:40,345
What is it, Lieutenant?

599
00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:41,780
Nothing, ma'am.

600
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:44,316
I told you to level with me--
that's an order.

601
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:45,651
I did, ma'am.

602
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:48,353
If you're hiding something from me...
I-I'm not,

603
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:50,456
ma'am, it's just...
(clears throat)

604
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,575
Please, uh, don't take this
the wrong way, Major,

605
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:54,660
but you don't seem
like a very...

606
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:56,028
I mean, you do,

607
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,965
and you don't, and I am just
way out of line-- I'm sorry.

608
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:01,967
Relax.

609
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:04,219
Ow!

610
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:05,421
Watch your head, sir.

611
00:25:05,423 --> 00:25:06,639
Yeah, that's, uh...

612
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:09,725
why they call it
"forewarning" there, Smalls.

613
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:16,231
These really necessary, sir?

614
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:17,983
You tell me.

615
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:20,519
First rule of
behavioral analysis

616
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:22,821
is that the best predictor

617
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:25,324
of future violence
is past violence.

618
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:28,110
You have no history
of violence.

619
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:30,395
Care to explain?

620
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:32,197
I've always taken
full responsibility

621
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:37,002
for my actions
and those who serve under me.

622
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:40,756
But I got to be honest
with you, sir.

623
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:43,008
I have no idea what happened.

624
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:47,846
Medical report says it was
a cocaine-induced psychosis.

625
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:50,683
That's-that's
just not possible, sir.

626
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:53,352
You sure about that,
Master Chief?

627
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:58,607
Because if it wasn't the drugs,
how do you explain

628
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:02,728
attacking several crew members
and two officers with a wrench?

629
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:07,449
I can't.

630
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:09,118
You trying
to silence your dealer

631
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,402
before we found him out?

632
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,237
No.

633
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,123
Let me see your arms.

634
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:31,890
Put your head back.

635
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:34,760
You can check between
my toes, my gums,

636
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:36,762
anywhere you like,

637
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:38,681
you're not gonna
find anything.

638
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:42,601
I have to set an example for the men
and women on this ship,

639
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:43,769
and I do.

640
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:45,938
I don't drink, I don't smoke,

641
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,023
and I don't do drugs.

642
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,609
Hell, I don't even eat red meat.

643
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,145
Do you have any enemies
on this ship?

644
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:57,916
I'd like to think not.

645
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:00,953
The average age
of the crew member on this ship

646
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,337
is 19 years old.

647
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:04,923
It's my job to help
train them to operate

648
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:07,760
the most powerful weapon
in the world.

649
00:27:07,762 --> 00:27:12,598
That takes discipline
and responsibility.

650
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,166
And yes...

651
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:16,668
sometimes there is friction.

652
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,053
Enough that one or more of them

653
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:20,139
would want to see you
busted for drug use,

654
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:22,307
maybe even OD?

655
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,952
It's a little early
for Secret Santa, isn't it?

656
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,705
Open it.

657
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:40,876
Okay.

658
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:46,832
Uh-huh.

659
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,636
(sighs)

660
00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:57,375
No.

661
00:27:58,261 --> 00:27:59,711
No, no.

662
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:01,930
This was not part of our deal.

663
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,016
You never said anything about...

664
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:05,317
panty hose.

665
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:09,221
Okay, they're leggings,
not panty hose,

666
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:11,223
and it's part
of your costume.

667
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:12,658
What it is,

668
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,227
is a death sentence
if Callen, Sam or Deeks

669
00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:16,695
ever saw me wearing them.

670
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,747
It's gonna be fun.
Wha...

671
00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:22,701
No. I am all for helping
children, but...

672
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:26,238
I'm sorry, I cannot do this.

673
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,074
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

674
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,593
You wear polar bear

675
00:28:31,595 --> 00:28:33,378
and Spiderman pajamas.

676
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,596
Spiderman is cool,

677
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:35,747
and polar bear...

678
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:37,516
It's different, okay?

679
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:40,052
I-I wear those
in the privacy of my own home.

680
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:42,221
People are going
to see me in this.

681
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:43,555
There will be kids

682
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,891
and the taking of pictures,
and next thing I know

683
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,559
it'll be on Facebook,
and then... and then...

684
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,611
and then a video on YouTube,
then it goes viral,

685
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:52,030
then they stat playing it
on a loop on the big screen,

686
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:53,704
and, oh, my God, Sam is
calling me Elfie McBeal...

687
00:28:53,729 --> 00:28:55,118
Okay, you know what?

688
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,435
You don't have to wear it.

689
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,541
Forget it.

690
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,111
Wai...

691
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:18,724
What now?

692
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:20,142
(sighs)
Two pilots were scrubbed

693
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:22,460
from flight
operations this morning...

694
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:24,629
due to "illness""

695
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:25,647
Cocaine?

696
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:26,965
Haven't heard yet,
but the scuttlebutt

697
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:29,067
around the ship
is that flight operations

698
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,435
might be suspended.

699
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:35,224
You get anything
from the chief?

700
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:37,442
Nothing but denial.

701
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,828
I got to say, I believe him.

702
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,447
This guy's service record's
cleaner than yours <i>or</i> mine.

703
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:43,749
Well...

704
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:46,835
definitely mine.

705
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:49,988
You think a disgruntled sailor
could be trying to set him up?

706
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,790
Possibly.

707
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:54,493
Doesn't explain the pilots.

708
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:57,846
Uncle Sam spends millions
to train these guys.

709
00:29:57,848 --> 00:30:01,099
They bust their asses
to get a chance to do this.

710
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:03,051
They're the best of the best.

711
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:06,054
Everyone I've questioned
has been exemplary.

712
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:09,007
And none of them have asked
for a JAG lawyer.

713
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,609
They all seem more concerned

714
00:30:10,611 --> 00:30:13,028
about their careers
than anything else.

715
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,947
Exactly like the XO.

716
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:16,915
Not what you would expect

717
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:19,517
from someone who knows
they're guilty.

718
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,454
Nope.

719
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,993
Do you think someone could
have unknowingly drugged them?

720
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:32,915
Could they be trying to sabotage
the ship and her mission?

721
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:34,666
The flight operations
are grounded--

722
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,919
they've already
succeeded.

723
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:40,689
There's something else.

724
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:45,010
I can't reach my wife.

725
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,902
MAN (over P.A.): ...safety team
to the ordnance elevator.

726
00:30:53,904 --> 00:30:55,354
On the double.

727
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:57,222
(low whistle)

728
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,192
Well, ahoy, mateys.

729
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:02,244
Can we help you?

730
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:04,246
Yeah, I'm just looking
for the ship's stores.

731
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:05,697
Well, you're looking at them.

732
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:07,282
Thought you would've
learned your lesson

733
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:08,450
about snooping around.

734
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:09,952
(chuckles)
Keep it up,

735
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:12,404
you're gonna end up
in sickbay, like your buddy.

736
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:14,456
What's that? Oh, yeah,
you guys didn't stick around

737
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,792
long enough to see me
kick his ass, did you?

738
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:19,261
Hold on, guys, I don't know
what's going on here,

739
00:31:19,263 --> 00:31:20,796
but if we don't get this thing
up and going again,

740
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:22,347
you're all gonna be eating
salmonella salad.

741
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:24,082
Yeah, well, if the damn thing
wouldn't keep breaking down,

742
00:31:24,084 --> 00:31:25,550
then we wouldn't have
to keep fixing it.

743
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,219
What seems to be the problem?

744
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,438
No problem--
we just had a faulty

745
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,423
refrigeration unit,
that's all.

746
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:33,642
They flew another one in.
Uh-huh.

747
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:35,360
I think I shared a seat with it.

748
00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:37,446
All right, well, listen,
I'm gonna take a look around

749
00:31:37,448 --> 00:31:38,947
if nobody has
a problem with that.

750
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:41,900
DEEKS:
You two? Show of hands? Okay.

751
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:49,541
(sighs)

752
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:02,620
Looks like we got it:
Colonel Mustard, on the ship...

753
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,124
...with a pipe valve.

754
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,013
Wow, wouldn't want my head
smashed into that.

755
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,800
(Deeks whistles)

756
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,654
(footsteps approaching)

757
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:21,156
(grunts)

758
00:32:21,158 --> 00:32:23,325
(choking gasps)

759
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:50,230
How long does it take Eric to
send a damn car to my house?

760
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,580
Maybe she wasn't home?

761
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:52,531
Then, where is she?

762
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:53,748
Sam...

763
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,284
if Sidirov was back in the
country, we would know.

764
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:58,736
The minute he contacts
Michelle, bells go off

765
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:00,505
with us and the CIA.

766
00:33:00,507 --> 00:33:02,173
ERIC: Guys.
You find her?

767
00:33:02,175 --> 00:33:06,094
Not yet, but initial forensics
suggest we got a match.

768
00:33:06,096 --> 00:33:07,045
Match for what?

769
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:08,547
The photo that Deeks sent.

770
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:11,299
It matches the head wound
that killed Agent Niles.

771
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:12,851
Deeks found
the murder weapon?

772
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:13,935
Looks that way.

773
00:33:13,937 --> 00:33:16,304
Some sort of pipe valve.

774
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:17,355
Where?

775
00:33:17,357 --> 00:33:18,773
I don't know.

776
00:33:18,775 --> 00:33:21,192
He hasn't answered
my last few e-mails.

777
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:23,311
If Deeks found
the murder site,

778
00:33:23,313 --> 00:33:26,364
he could have found the thing
that got Agent Niles killed.

779
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:28,783
Can you determine where on the
ship the photos were taken?

780
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:31,019
It'll be tough since
the paint schematics are uniform

781
00:33:31,021 --> 00:33:32,687
throughout the ship,
but I'll cross-reference

782
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:35,156
with the plumbing schematics,
see what I find.

783
00:33:35,158 --> 00:33:38,076
Alert Kensi, you call us,
you find anything else.

784
00:33:38,078 --> 00:33:39,294
Got it.

785
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:40,612
If you wanted
to poison the crew,

786
00:33:40,614 --> 00:33:41,746
you only have a few options:

787
00:33:41,748 --> 00:33:46,251
air, water, food, or some sort
of surface contact.

788
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:48,169
If Deeks was following up
on his spinach clue,

789
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:49,137
he was probably snooping

790
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:50,972
around the food
stores on the ship.

791
00:33:50,974 --> 00:33:54,225
Nobody knows the ship better
than the command master chief.

792
00:33:54,227 --> 00:33:55,343
He could pinpoint
the location.

793
00:33:55,345 --> 00:33:56,811
All right,
I'll show him the photo.

794
00:33:56,813 --> 00:33:57,846
You find Kens.

795
00:33:57,848 --> 00:33:59,564
Open it.

796
00:33:59,566 --> 00:34:00,982
Sir.

797
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,968
You know where this is?

798
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,637
It's a main steam valve.

799
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:08,139
They're all over the ship.
In food stores?

800
00:34:08,141 --> 00:34:09,991
Yes, sir.
Show me.

801
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:18,166
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

802
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:20,368
(phone chimes)

803
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:27,225
You got this?
Yes, ma'am.

804
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:30,478
MASTER CHIEF:
<i>Make way!</i>

805
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,048
Coming through!

806
00:34:37,303 --> 00:34:39,337
Hey, what the
hell's going on?

807
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,505
Deeks found
the murder weapon,

808
00:34:40,507 --> 00:34:42,023
but now we can't reach him.

809
00:34:43,442 --> 00:34:45,944
MAN (over P.A.): Would Commander Hanna
and Major Barret please report

810
00:34:45,946 --> 00:34:50,532
to zero-two-tack-one-four-four-
tack-seven-Lima compartment?

811
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:52,734
This way.

812
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:59,574
Is this what
you're looking for?

813
00:35:00,793 --> 00:35:03,861
It's consistent with the photos
of the victim's wounds.

814
00:35:03,863 --> 00:35:05,580
Callen?

815
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:07,499
Did you find him?

816
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:10,135
No, but I think
we're in the right spot.

817
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,754
Deeks?

818
00:35:13,472 --> 00:35:15,557
Hey... you boys see

819
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,258
the guy you were beating up on
yesterday?

820
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,260
The guy who kicked
your ass, sir?

821
00:35:19,262 --> 00:35:20,428
He what?

822
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,180
Do you see
where he went?

823
00:35:22,182 --> 00:35:24,516
He was snooping around
here a few minutes ago.

824
00:35:25,935 --> 00:35:27,602
Hey, hold up a second.

825
00:35:27,604 --> 00:35:30,105
Yo, with the trash!

826
00:35:31,857 --> 00:35:33,891
Go, go! I got it.
I got it. I got it.

827
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:35,744
SAM: Federal agents!
Deeks...

828
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:48,957
(gunfire)

829
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:09,527
(yells)

830
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:13,231
(grunts)

831
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:15,817
Shooter's down, G.

832
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:19,571
Like that little
bank shot, huh?

833
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:21,773
Little eight ball,
corner pocket?

834
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:23,208
Yeah, I taught you that.

835
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,325
You didn't teach me that.

836
00:36:24,327 --> 00:36:26,044
I definitely taught you that.

837
00:36:26,046 --> 00:36:28,546
(scoffs)
You say <i>my</i> memory's going.

838
00:36:28,548 --> 00:36:30,465
(chuckles)

839
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:32,300
I know it's needless to say,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

840
00:36:32,302 --> 00:36:33,835
Thank you.

841
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:36,721
Couldn't let him throw away
a perfectly good partner.

842
00:36:36,723 --> 00:36:37,672
Did you get him?

843
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:38,973
Yep.

844
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:40,225
KENSI:
Is he talking?

845
00:36:40,227 --> 00:36:42,177
Not so much; he's dead.

846
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:43,645
SAM: Master Chief,
could you secure the body?

847
00:36:43,647 --> 00:36:45,346
MASTER CHIEF:
Yes, sir.

848
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:48,767
You here and you with me.

849
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:51,069
Come on.

850
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:53,688
Okay, so we know where
they killed Agent Niles,

851
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,139
but still no drugs.

852
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:56,808
Well, it seems
like somebody's been sabotaging

853
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,577
the refrigeration unit
on these storage containers.

854
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:04,666
K-9s already
searched that area.

855
00:37:06,085 --> 00:37:08,703
DEEKS: Maybe they were sabotaging the
refrigeration unit so the food

856
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:09,838
would spoil, you know?

857
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,873
The smell
would throw off the dogs.

858
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:14,509
It's not that easy.

859
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,349
Fresh paint.

860
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:29,557
What?

861
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:30,775
KENSI:
It's in the paint?

862
00:37:30,777 --> 00:37:32,477
Wow, they're good.

863
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:34,512
You got to be
kidding me.

864
00:37:34,514 --> 00:37:37,982
(phone beeps)
They're really good.

865
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,821
Damn.

866
00:37:42,823 --> 00:37:45,657
Sam?

867
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:47,575
It's Michelle.

868
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:50,044
Everything all right?

869
00:37:50,046 --> 00:37:52,997
She was at a friend's house
finishing up costumes

870
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:54,465
for the kids' play.

871
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:57,085
Totally forgot about
the Christmas pageant.

872
00:37:57,087 --> 00:37:58,670
What'd I tell you?

873
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:00,672
You said she'd be all right.

874
00:38:00,674 --> 00:38:03,508
I also said the memory
is the first to go.

875
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,676
(sighs)

876
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:08,680
I said it.

877
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:11,733
ERIC:
<i>Leonard Wall is</i>

878
00:38:11,735 --> 00:38:14,719
a produce supplier
who recently won a Navy contract

879
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:18,022
by significantly underbidding
everyone else.

880
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:19,824
He could afford to lose money
on the produce

881
00:38:19,826 --> 00:38:21,826
because he was using the Navy
to transport his drugs.

882
00:38:21,828 --> 00:38:23,661
The ship's lab confirmed
that the paint

883
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:25,079
in the container
was, like,

884
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:28,616
a highly concentrated cocaine-
hydrochloride mixture.

885
00:38:28,618 --> 00:38:30,034
Drug dogs
can't smell it.

886
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:31,703
Yeah, it was
a pretty good plan,

887
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:33,521
but what
he did not consider

888
00:38:33,523 --> 00:38:35,957
was that the coke mixture
would leach into the produce.

889
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:38,293
All crew members
were potentially exposed.

890
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:40,295
Cocaine toxicity can be
potentially lethal,

891
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:41,746
can also cause

892
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:43,715
severe behavioral changes
like we saw in the master chief,

893
00:38:43,717 --> 00:38:45,266
which proves

894
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:48,720
my theory that eating healthy
is not only boring,

895
00:38:48,722 --> 00:38:49,921
it's downright dangerous.

896
00:38:49,923 --> 00:38:52,941
ERIC: Uh, Hetty has arranged
an NCIS Red Team

897
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:56,260
in Okinawa to meet the ship
and surreptitiously track

898
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:59,096
the container
when it's off-loaded in Japan,

899
00:38:59,098 --> 00:39:00,915
so that we can intercept
the drugs

900
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:02,483
at their final destination.

901
00:39:02,485 --> 00:39:05,153
So it looks
like we're going home.

902
00:39:05,155 --> 00:39:07,772
KENSI:
Right, Eric?

903
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:08,907
Uh, absolutely.

904
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:11,409
I've already processed
your travel orders.

905
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:12,493
When?

906
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:14,662
I'd say, uh, about an hour ago.

907
00:39:14,664 --> 00:39:15,997
When are we leaving?

908
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:19,384
Look, guys, uh,
in the spirit of the season,

909
00:39:19,386 --> 00:39:21,369
please don't hate me.

910
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:25,306
I tried everything,
I called in every favor I could,

911
00:39:25,308 --> 00:39:27,725
but the earliest
I can get you guys all home

912
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:31,312
to Los Angeles is...
December 27.

913
00:39:31,314 --> 00:39:32,347
KENSI:
What?

914
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:35,767
What, no, n-n-no snow,
no hot tub?

915
00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:37,318
Hetty can pull some strings.

916
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,354
She's already left
for the break.

917
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:42,023
I'm sorry,
she abandoned us at sea?

918
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:43,241
You know,
if it's any consolation,

919
00:39:43,243 --> 00:39:44,976
she waited
until the case was wrapped

920
00:39:44,978 --> 00:39:47,161
and knew you were all safe
before she left.

921
00:39:47,163 --> 00:39:48,413
Why is it that,
every time you ask

922
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:50,648
if it's any consolation,
it's not.

923
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,151
CALLEN:
Eric, don't sweat it.

924
00:39:53,153 --> 00:39:54,786
We know you worked hard--
enjoy your holidays.

925
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:56,838
Thanks, guys.
You, too.

926
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,290
And, again, I'm really sorry.

927
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:01,209
(Deeks makes
whooshing sound)

928
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:04,045
♪

929
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:10,468
Well, y'all mocked my forensic
botany, but in the end...

930
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,320
Your spinach played
a vital role.

931
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:13,604
Thank you,
thank you for that.

932
00:40:13,606 --> 00:40:14,806
Was that so, uh,

933
00:40:14,808 --> 00:40:16,007
so hard, huh?

934
00:40:16,009 --> 00:40:18,359
Actually, don't beat
yourself up too much.

935
00:40:18,361 --> 00:40:21,512
After all, I am the only person
here that's an actual detective.

936
00:40:21,514 --> 00:40:23,648
That's because
we're special agents.

937
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,349
Yeah, well, where I grew up,
"special" meant

938
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:28,019
that you took the short bus and
wore a helmet in the sandbox.

939
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:30,121
That's almost as funny as you
telling those two sailors

940
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:31,789
you kicked my ass.

941
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:33,241
(laughs)
Really?

942
00:40:33,243 --> 00:40:34,492
You said that?

943
00:40:34,494 --> 00:40:36,711
I didn't;
my undercover character did.

944
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:37,745
Right.
Ah.

945
00:40:37,747 --> 00:40:39,330
MASTER CHIEF:
Gentlemen,

946
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:40,331
ma'am...

947
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:41,466
I want to thank you

948
00:40:41,468 --> 00:40:42,467
for everything you've done

949
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:44,919
for the ship,
the crew and...

950
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:46,537
especially myself.

951
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:48,339
It's our pleasure,
Command Master Chief.

952
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:50,391
I'm sorry that this
has adversely affected

953
00:40:50,393 --> 00:40:52,543
your holiday plans with your
family, but, uh, at least

954
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:54,078
you can have some eggnog
and Christmas dinner.

955
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,598
The cook staff pulls out all
the stops for the holidays.

956
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,050
That sounds fantastic.
Thank you, sir.

957
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:00,151
Thank you very much.

958
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:01,936
Thank you.

959
00:41:01,938 --> 00:41:03,488
Officer on deck.

960
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,490
As you were.

961
00:41:08,444 --> 00:41:09,694
Hetty.

962
00:41:09,696 --> 00:41:10,945
Merry Christmas.

963
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:11,709
What?

964
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:13,223
KENSI: We thought you
were on vacation.

965
00:41:13,323 --> 00:41:15,033
I was on my
way to Macao

966
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:16,367
for the holidays

967
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:17,768
and I decided to make

968
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,320
a pit stop here.

969
00:41:20,622 --> 00:41:23,641
There is an F-18
Super Hornet up on deck

970
00:41:23,643 --> 00:41:26,210
for a return flight
to Coronado.

971
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:28,329
The backseat is
empty, Mr. Hanna.

972
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:31,249
If you were to
leave right now,

973
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:34,635
you could make it home
by Christmas morning.

974
00:41:34,637 --> 00:41:35,720
For real?

975
00:41:35,722 --> 00:41:38,055
Have I ever lied to you?

976
00:41:39,508 --> 00:41:41,058
Oh, whoa!
I love you, Hetty.

977
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,842
Oh.

978
00:41:41,844 --> 00:41:43,844
(kissing): Mwah!
Uh...

979
00:41:43,846 --> 00:41:45,146
(laughter)

980
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:46,130
Now put me down...

981
00:41:46,132 --> 00:41:47,348
(laughs)

982
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,066
(laughter)

983
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:49,900
Thank you, sir.

984
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:51,235
Get out of here already.

985
00:41:51,237 --> 00:41:52,303
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, indeed.

986
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:53,854
Merry Christmas.
Bye, Sam!

987
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:55,323
HETTY:
Now, who's got

988
00:41:55,325 --> 00:41:56,691
the eggnog?

989
00:42:03,198 --> 00:42:05,249
(quietly):
Merry Christmas.

990
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:08,485
(bells jingling)

991
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:12,373
Whoa, you look...

992
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:13,924
Elfin?

993
00:42:13,926 --> 00:42:15,376
Elfin amazing.

994
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:16,377
(laughs)

995
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:18,379
I don't know what to say.

996
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:20,798
Well, I believe the
traditional greeting

997
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,383
is "Merry Christmas"--

998
00:42:22,385 --> 00:42:27,438
"Happy holidays" if you're
feeling politically correct.

999
00:42:36,114 --> 00:42:39,867
What was... that?

1000
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,992
(both chuckle)

1001
00:42:47,994 --> 00:42:51,996
Uh, I hope you have
a really nice holiday

1002
00:42:51,998 --> 00:42:57,151
and I will...
see you next year.

1003
00:42:59,888 --> 00:43:01,538
Hey, hey, wait, you know what?

1004
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,399
I'm just gonna go get my tights.

1005
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,903
They're called leggings.

1006
00:43:07,348 --> 00:43:09,310
Oh, and don't forget your ears.
