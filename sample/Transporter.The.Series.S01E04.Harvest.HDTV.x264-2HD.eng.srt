00:45:47,419 --> 00:45:50,220
Removing dry cement
from an automobile.

498
00:45:50,255 --> 00:45:55,159
You see, Frank, this is
a very long, very tiring process.

499
00:45:55,226 --> 00:45:57,929
- You want to know what's involved?
- Not really.

500
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:01,832
You take one part of muriatic
acid and four parts of water,

501
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:05,335
and then you use
a toothbrush to scrub it away

502
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:07,838
at the hardened concrete.

503
00:46:13,377 --> 00:46:14,945
Yeah.

504
00:46:19,215 --> 00:46:22,317
Here, feel that.

505
00:46:22,352 --> 00:46:24,186
I don't want to
feel your back, Dieter.

506
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,604
Just feel.

507
00:46:26,605 --> 00:46:29,758
Oh! Yeah. 
Do you feel that?

508
00:46:29,793 --> 00:46:32,227
I'm n...
I'm not a doctor, Dieter.

509
00:46:32,328 --> 00:46:35,263
If you need to see a doctor,
you should see one.

510
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:45,474
What I need is a massage.

511
00:46:45,508 --> 00:46:48,776
- I thought you got a massage.
- It was not what I was expecting.

512
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:52,279
What were you...
I don't want to know, do I?

513
00:46:54,516 --> 00:46:58,218
It didn't end well.
That's all you need to know.
