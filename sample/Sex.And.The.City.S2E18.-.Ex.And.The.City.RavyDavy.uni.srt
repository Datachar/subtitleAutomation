1
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,440
Llfe ls all about maklng cholces.

2
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,041
Some cholces, llke who you marry,
are blg...

3
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,176
...whlle others are even blgger.

4
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,915
What do you think?

5
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:59,419
The $5 ones that Iast three days,
or the $10 ones that Iast five?

6
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,283
Either one.

7
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,529
Three days.

8
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,595
$5.

9
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,498
Another cholce ls how to deal
wlth an ex-boyfrlend.

10
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,935
Some women handle lt
coolly, calmly, whlle others....

11
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,233
Fuck!

12
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,032
Steve.

13
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,604
Go!

14
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,911
$5! Come back here!

15
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,721
He Iooked so hurt.

16
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,555
Like a kid in one of those
big-eyed veIvet paintings.

17
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,793
Poor Steve.

18
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,557
I'm sorry, I panicked.

19
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,723
What was I to do, chat about the weather?

20
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,291
-The man's been inside me.
-CouId I have more Sweet 'N Low?

21
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,030
I've never been abIe
to be friends with an ex.

22
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,701
I meet those coupIes who stay friends
and I think, ''How do they do that?''

23
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:54,543
I've never been friends with men. Women
are for friendships, men are for fucking.

24
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,581
You must Iearn to form an opinion.

25
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:00,881
Friendship is the bonus of a reIationship.
No reIationship, no friendship.

26
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:04,252
If your coupIe doesn't work,
you withhoId friendship as a punishment?

27
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,085
You make it sound so bad.

28
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,389
BIack widow spiders bite
their mate's heads off when it's over.

29
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,930
WithhoIding friendship
is Ietting them off easy.

30
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,523
Imagine, instead of
the awfuI break-up scene...

31
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,660
...you say, ''Come here''...

32
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,293
...and chomp their head off.

33
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,863
I wouId Iove to be
one of those peopIe who's aII:

34
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:26,067
''We Ioved, thank you.
You enriched my Iife. Now, go, prosper.''

35
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,512
I'm much more: ''We didn't work out,
you need to not exist.''

36
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,846
What?

37
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,584
It's just so chiIdish.

38
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,215
Not you, the whoIe situation.

39
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,417
We keep dresses we'II never wear
but throw away our ex-boyfriends.

40
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,460
I'm not saying that I'm any better.

41
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,729
I haven't been abIe
to be friends with Big, but....

42
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,936
If you Ioved someone and you break up...

43
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,303
...where does the Iove go?

44
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,169
To their next girIfriend.

45
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,210
No. That is a different Iove.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,842
The Iove that Big and I had cannot
be same thing he has with Natasha.

47
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:09,184
Natasha? When'd you stop caIIing her
the Idiot Stick Figure With No SouI?

48
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,917
About three weeks ago
when I saw them at Cafe M.

49
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,824
He was hoIding her hand and smiIing and...

50
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,525
...I finaIIy got it.

51
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,032
They're happy, sIash, we're over.

52
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,030
It was okay.

53
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,638
-Natasha, what a buIIshit name.
-TotaIIy.

54
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,678
-Stupid.
-CompIete buIIshit.

55
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,541
Later that nlght,
I got to thlnklng about the ex factor.

56
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:40,116
In mathematlcs, we learned
that ''x'' stands for the unknown.

57
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,377
''a'' plus ''b'' equals ''x.''

58
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,826
But what's really unknown ls.: what
plus what equals frlendshlp wlth an ex?

59
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,426
Is thls an unsolvable equatlon?

60
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,929
Or ls lt posslble to transform
a once-passlonate love...

61
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,992
...lnto somethlng that flts
nlce and easlly onto the frlendshlp shelf?

62
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,034
I couldn't help but wonder...

63
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,704
...can you be frlends wlth an ex?

64
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,112
That Sunday afternoon, Mlranda was
enjoylng a blscottl and the paper when....

65
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,277
There lt was...

66
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,081
...her ex's head.

67
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,783
I hear you breathing.

68
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,930
Yeah. Hi!

69
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,664
That was a shitty thing you did,
running away from me on the street.

70
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,362
I didn't run.

71
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:31,895
You ran.

72
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,796
I wasn't expecting to see you--

73
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,272
It reaIIy hurt my feeIings.

74
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,805
I don't do very weII
with ex-boyfriends and....

75
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,676
This is me.

76
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,646
Steve.

77
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,285
I heId your head whiIe you were sIeeping.

78
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,300
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,805
I'm so sorry.

80
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,500
It's okay.

81
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,010
I hadn't seen you in so Iong
and I missed you...

82
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,338
...and then I did that shitty thing.

83
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,482
-It wasn't that shitty.
-It was.

84
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,813
It was a shitty thing. I'm a shitty person.

85
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,615
-You are not a shitty person.
-I am! I am shitty!

86
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,722
You'd never do anything that shitty.

87
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,259
How about showing up at your apartment
and caIIing you shitty?

88
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,592
Yeah, that was pretty shitty.

89
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,025
You've got a ''bat in the cave.''

90
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,005
I miss you.

91
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,105
Whenever something funny happens,
I aIways want to teII you about it.

92
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,945
So teII me.

93
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:53,916
Just 'cause we broke up doesn't mean
we can't have a friendIy meaI, does it?

94
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,520
I guess not.

95
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,985
What are you doing Friday?

96
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,990
I have a date.

97
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,724
Looking forward to it, are you?

98
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,359
As Mlranda made plans
to have dlnner wlth her last love...

99
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,638
...Charlotte came face to face
wlth the memory of her flrst...

100
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,435
...her horse, Taddy.

101
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,346
Charlotte's relatlonshlp wlth Taddy ended...

102
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,475
...when he threw her
durlng a teen equestrlan competltlon...

103
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,454
...causlng her to break her collarbone
and lose the blue rlbbon.

104
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:35,360
Her father promptly sold Taddy
and she hadn't been on a horse slnce.

105
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,864
Charlotte wondered lf lt was tlme
to get back ln the saddle.

106
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,901
Meanwhlle, across town...

107
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,099
...Samantha was about to see
a stalllon of her own.

108
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,997
I gotta say, you Iook amazing.

109
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,827
Excuse me, but do I know you?

110
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,638
Not yet.

111
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,833
I was thinking maybe you'd
have dinner with me sometime.

112
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,972
What makes you think that?

113
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,073
The way you were just checking me out.

114
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,640
You get 10 points for directness.

115
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,776
Do I aIso get your phone number?

116
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,444
I'm not sure yet.

117
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,288
I'II teII you what....

118
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,490
Here's my business card.

119
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,294
You caII me.

120
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,255
BIatantIy picking a woman up
on the street.

121
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,362
How'd you get to be so cocky?

122
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,466
I was born that way, I guess.

123
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,599
At Ieast consider meeting me
for a friendIy IittIe drink.

124
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,940
I'II think about it, Mr. Cocky.

125
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,111
PIease do.

126
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:17,125
Later that week, when I spotted
a Laura Ashley dress, clrca 1988...

127
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,096
...stlll hanglng ln my closet...

128
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:23,397
...I declded lt was tlme
to glve my ex a frlendly phone call.

129
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:35,538
I hadn't planned on the Idlot Stlck Flgure
Wlth No Soul answerlng.

130
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,009
Then, I remembered Blg had caller ID.

131
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,981
Shit!

132
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,355
HeIIo yourseIf.

133
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,368
-Did you just caII?
-No--

134
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,063
Yes, but I didn't get to taIk because...

135
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,975
...I accidentaIIy hit the thing...

136
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,745
...so, you know, it hung up.

137
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,676
So, yes.

138
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,284
And I...

139
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:16,651
...I heard Natasha, so, apoIogize to her.

140
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,957
How is Natasha?

141
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,420
Great.

142
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,256
She's great.

143
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,166
How are you?

144
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,964
I'm A-OK.

145
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,604
You sound a IittIe nuts.

146
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,342
Can't you Iet one go by?

147
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,334
This is weird.

148
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,470
The first caII.

149
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:42,814
Right.

150
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,841
Maybe I'd...

151
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,011
...do better if I went with
my IittIe prepared speech.

152
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,719
You have a speech?

153
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,755
I was wondering what you thought of...

154
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,121
...instead of pretending
each other doesn't exist...

155
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,129
...we try to be friends or something?

156
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,803
I'd Iike that.

157
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,938
I've been meanlng to call, but I dldn't
know lf you wanted to hear from me--

158
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,808
-Want to have a lunch or somethlng?
-Let's.

159
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,210
Thank you.

160
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,019
I have a 1:00 reservation. Bradshaw.

161
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,716
I used to make our lunch reservatlons
ln Blg's name.

162
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,091
But today, I put lt ln mlne,
because that's what frlends do.

163
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,757
The other party is aIready here.

164
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,290
Thank you.

165
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,874
Are you hungry? Because I am.

166
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,242
I got up at 6:00, worked out,
hardIy had any breakfast.

167
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,882
They have a great Cobb saIad here.

168
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,351
ShaII we eat?

169
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,015
-Let's eat.
-We'II eat.

170
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,956
And that's when I reallzed,
Blg was nervous.

171
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,889
It was odd. The new ''frlend'' part of me
felt lncredlbly compasslonate...

172
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,363
...whlle the old ''glrlfrlend'' part of me
felt lncredlbly smug.

173
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,091
-You okay?
-Fine.

174
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,870
You Iook good.

175
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,778
Thank you, so do you.

176
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,111
Good afternoon.

177
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,617
The Cobb saIad is very good here.

178
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,180
Can I get you something to drink?

179
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,649
Iced tea.

180
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,726
A mineraI water.

181
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,057
-Scotch.
-CosmopoIitan.

182
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:46,201
An hour later, I had solved
the unsolvable frlendshlp equatlon.

183
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,606
It seems the answer ls thls.:

184
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:52,676
Cosmopolltans plus scotch
equals frlendshlp wlth an ex.

185
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,945
And what about your music?

186
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:01,350
If I had to Iisten to freakin'
BIood, Sweat & Tears one more time....

187
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,612
-BIood, Sweat & Tears is great stuff.
-10 minutes after we're awake?

188
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,121
TeII me about the girI.

189
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,138
-ReaIIy?
-Friends taIk about their reIationships.

190
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:24,006
Go ahead, friend, teII me about the girI.

191
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,582
-She's very sweet--
-Okay, enough!

192
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,079
Don't teII me about the girI. No can do.

193
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,018
Maybe we shouId make a pact:

194
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:42,254
We don't taIk about our reIationships
untiI they get reaIIy serious.

195
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,661
It is serious.

196
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,605
We're engaged.

197
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,081
I wanted you to hear it from me.

198
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,344
I just got a spIitting headache.

199
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,384
I didn't know how to teII you....

200
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,589
-When you caIIed for Iunch--
-Engaged?

201
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,225
How can you be engaged? You have
a probIem with commitment, remember?

202
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:24,726
In fact, you toId me you never wanted
to get married again, ever.

203
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,297
Things change.

204
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,398
You just didn't want to marry me.

205
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,500
-Natasha and I--
-Don't say her name!

206
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,943
Don't you dare say her name to me!

207
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,842
You string me aIong for two years...

208
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:41,146
...then you marry some 25-year-oId girI
after onIy five months?

209
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,523
-I did not string you aIong.
-Fine, you didn't.

210
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,754
You know what? I have to go.
I have a headache.

211
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,325
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

212
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,722
Don't heIp me! Don't you heIp me!

213
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,734
Carrie, hoId on, wait.

214
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,961
What is it?

215
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,174
-Don't end it Iike this--
-You did it Iike this. I was being friendIy.

216
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,301
This seems Iike a much better way
to end things.

217
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,211
Go. Be engaged, get married to...

218
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,645
...Nijinsky or whatever her name is.
Have a nice Iife.

219
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,785
Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

220
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,352
These steps are very dangerous.

221
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,825
The next day, I had promlsed to hold
Charlotte's hand whlle she trled rldlng.

222
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,462
It turned out,
she needed to hold mlne as well.

223
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,171
How are you doing?

224
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,274
Aside from the fact that my ex
is engaged to a teenager...

225
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:42,178
...and I've got horseshit
on my goddamn $300 shoes...

226
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,042
...I'm doing okay.

227
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,650
I think you're amazing.

228
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,911
I wouId be in a hospitaI or something.

229
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,322
What the fuck is his probIem?

230
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,452
He's got a stubborn streak.

231
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,816
Some horses never reaIIy Iike to be ridden.

232
00:14:55,961 --> 00:15:00,398
Taddy was Iike that when I first got him,
but once I broke him in, he Ioved it.

233
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,891
You know what?

234
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,195
I broke in Big.

235
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:07,567
I broke him in and the Idiot Stick Figure
With No SouI gets to ride him.

236
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,633
I'm reaIIy sorry.

237
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,208
I know you are. Thanks.

238
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,346
Damn!

239
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,244
You see, this is what happens.

240
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,312
You try to be friendIy with an ex
and you wind up knee-deep in shit!

241
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:27,826
Perfect.

242
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,995
This is PaI. He's a good boy.

243
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,902
He's brown.

244
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:44,339
Taddy was brown,
but he had white spots on his fIank.

245
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,640
Just stay tiII I'm on the horse,
then you can go, okay?

246
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,945
I'm here, it's aII IoveIy. Go have fun.

247
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,543
Hey, PaI.

248
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,554
Foot in and up you go.

249
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,783
As Charlotte put her boot ln the stlrrup...

250
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:03,794
...all her bad memorles of Taddy,
broken bones and rlbbons flooded over her.

251
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,789
No!

252
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,025
Can't.

253
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,229
-No, I can't. Let's go.
-You just paid.

254
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,864
-I said, I can't!
-He's aII saddIed up.

255
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,638
After a few
''get to know each other'' phone calls...

256
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,182
...Samantha took up Mr. Cocky
on hls offer of a frlendly drlnk.

257
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,210
Turns out, lt was a very frlendly drlnk.

258
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,213
I want you to know,
I never pick up guys on the street...

259
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,451
...unIess they're very cute.

260
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,727
Get over here, you cutie.

261
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,588
Before we go any further...

262
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,834
...I gotta warn you about something.

263
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,432
Warn me about what?

264
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,397
I'm very weII-endowed.

265
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,140
Jackpot.

266
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,008
No. I'm serious.

267
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,408
It's huge.

268
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,152
Most women can't handIe it.

269
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,956
I'm not most women.

270
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,354
Unzip and get over here.

271
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:16,625
Samantha suddenly understood
what made Mr. Cocky so cocky.

272
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,874
I'm teIIing you,
it was Iike a waII of fIesh coming at me.

273
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,814
Nothing is scarier
than a reaIIy big one coming at you.

274
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,285
I didn't even want my mouth near it,
I was afraid I'd get Iockjaw.

275
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,651
It was quite a shock.
His hands are reIativeIy tiny.

276
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,885
-Don't teII me you beIieve that.
-Not anymore.

277
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,830
I'm going to have to psych myseIf up
before I try it again.

278
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,989
You're going to try it again? Why?

279
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,666
-Because it's there.
-It's a penis, not Mount Everest.

280
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,864
If it was Mount Everest...

281
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:57,102
...Iast night I couId onIy make it
to Base Camp One.

282
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,209
You dated Mr. Big, I'm dating Mr. Too Big.

283
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,279
You're unbeIievabIe.

284
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,112
You broke up with James because
he was too smaII, this guy is too big.

285
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,183
Who are you, GoIdicocks?

286
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,253
Yep.

287
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,251
I'm Iooking for one that's just right.

288
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,152
That nlght, after a frlendly dlnner...

289
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,560
...Steve and Mlranda began to explore
thelr newfound frlendshlp.

290
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,361
If you were a reaI friend,
you'd Iet me keep it.

291
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,336
Sorry, it's part of a break-up.
You gotta return my fire department shirt.

292
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,407
-It fits me perfectIy.
-TeII it to the judge.

293
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,304
-PIease?
-Nope.

294
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,344
Thanks for coming out for dinner.

295
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,646
Thanks for Ietting me pay, finaIIy.

296
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,084
That's what friends do, isn't it?

297
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,824
Goodnight.

298
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,856
That's what friends do, isn't it?

299
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,261
I got another question for you.

300
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,437
Do friends kiss...

301
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,234
...here?

302
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:08,871
No.

303
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,514
Do friends kiss here?

304
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,752
No.

305
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,455
Do friends kiss....

306
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,292
Yeah.

307
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,562
We had good reasons
for breaking up, right?

308
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,688
Yeah.

309
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,130
Money, scheduIes, goaIs.

310
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,928
Good reasons.

311
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,371
What now?

312
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,241
Are we stiII just friends?

313
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,483
Yeah, we're stiII just friends.

314
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,716
Friends who have sex.

315
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,331
And ln a bed across town....

316
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,766
Ready?

317
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,412
Wait.

318
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,274
Wait.

319
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:54,715
After two yoga classes and a hlt
of the best Hawallan gold she could flnd...

320
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,289
...Samantha was ready to take
another run at Mount Everest.

321
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,815
Okay, here we go.

322
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,027
Nice and easy.

323
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,465
That's it.

324
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,240
Easy--

325
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,179
Easy.

326
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,049
Good.

327
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,184
Good.

328
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,759
Okay, here we go.

329
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:37,990
Here we go?

330
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,291
Yeah.

331
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,591
We're not there yet?

332
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,197
-No.
-Okay, stop.

333
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,030
Whoa, boy.

334
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,803
Can we just be friends?

335
00:21:56,348 --> 00:22:00,614
And just llke that,
Samantha made her very flrst male frlend.

336
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:07,348
The next day ln Central Park,
Charlotte was maklng a new frlend as well.

337
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:10,860
Good, PaI.

338
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,625
She had declded she and Pal
were movlng too fast.

339
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:18,835
Before golng any further, they needed
to get to know each other better.

340
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,770
You're a good boy, PaI.

341
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,739
Does that feeI good?

342
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,967
You Iike that? My Taddy Iiked that, too.

343
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,642
I Ioved my Taddy so much.

344
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,583
Oh, good boy.

345
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,518
And wlth that gentle nudge
from her new pal...

346
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,452
...all Charlotte's bad feellngs
about Taddy llfted...

347
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:44,153
...and she remembered just how much
she had loved hls cute whlte spots.

348
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,126
Easy.

349
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,226
Okay. Go, boy, go!

350
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,654
Hey, lt's Carrle, I'm shoe shopplng.

351
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,826
It's me, are you there?

352
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,295
Pick up if you're there.

353
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,825
You're not there.

354
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:31,571
I'm caIIing to say
I feeI bad about Iast week.

355
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,273
I didn't mean for it to happen Iike that...

356
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,482
...I thought you needed to know.

357
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,782
I hated to think someone eIse
might teII you.

358
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,848
Chrlst.

359
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,019
I feel llke a real shlt. I'm sorry.

360
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,995
I'm really sorry...

361
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,137
...I would never hurt you dellberately--

362
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,472
I know you wouIdn't.

363
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,735
-You're there?
-I'm here.

364
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,346
Like I was saying, I'm sorry.

365
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,943
I'm sorry, too.

366
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,815
I shouIdn't have reacted Iike that.

367
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,557
It was such a shock.

368
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,457
I guess it was a shock
I needed to hear to move on.

369
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,299
Yeah.

370
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:41,101
I wish you aII the best. I do.

371
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,740
I hope you and Natasha wiII be very happy.

372
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,577
Do you mean that?

373
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:47,911
No.

374
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,781
But I wlll.

375
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,655
Really. I hope...

376
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,228
...some day very soon...

377
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,823
...we can aII meet for a drink
and be great friends.

378
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,433
Llke they do ln the movles.

379
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,374
Bye.

380
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,310
Bye.

381
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,727
And I actually managed to hold
onto those frlendly feellngs, untll....

382
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,118
I can't beIieve my ex-boyfriend
is at the PIaza...

383
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,189
...having an engagement brunch.

384
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,315
And he had the nerve to invite you.

385
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,121
It's my own fauIt.

386
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,856
I had to make the big
''Iet's be friends'' speech.

387
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,431
Who am I kidding?
Big and I were never friends, we were...

388
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,230
...something eIse.

389
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:15,198
Something that did not end
with an engagement party at the PIaza.

390
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,499
-Do we want another round?
-What do you think?

391
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,271
Four more, pIease.

392
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:23,474
I think I can actuaIIy feeI them
over there eating shrimp.

393
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,547
It's just--why her?

394
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,150
I mean reaIIy....

395
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,422
Why her?

396
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,354
One word: HubbeII.

397
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,256
HubbeII.

398
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,352
Oh, my god. HubbeII.

399
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,657
It is so HubbeII.

400
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:41,892
Who's HubbeII?

401
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:42,899
HubbeII!

402
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,697
Robert ''HubbeII'' Redford
in The Way We Were.

403
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,465
I Iove that movie.

404
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,167
I Iove, Iove, Iove, that movie.

405
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,835
-Never saw it.
-Oh, my god!

406
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,842
What are you, an aIien?
How couId you have not seen it?

407
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,107
Chick fiIm.

408
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:01,279
Robert Redford
is madIy in Iove with Barbara Streisand.

409
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,009
-Katie.
-K-k-k-katie.

410
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,748
K-k-k-katie, right!

411
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:08,017
But he can't be with her
because she's too compIicated...

412
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,521
...and she has wiId, curIy hair.

413
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,688
HeIIo? C-c-c-curIy.

414
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,197
He Ieaves her and marries this...

415
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,700
...simpIe girI with straight hair.

416
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,565
Ladies, I am having an epiphany.

417
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,566
The worId is made of two types of women:

418
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,902
The ''simpIe'' girIs and the ''Katie'' girIs.

419
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,506
I'm a ''Katie'' girI and where are our drinks?

420
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,539
I aIways cry at the Iast scene
in that movie...

421
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:36,678
-...when she sees him with his new wife--
-The simpIe girI.

422
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,449
-And she reaches up--
-And smoothes his hair away.

423
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,024
She says to him:

424
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,183
''Your girI is IoveIy, HubbeII.''

425
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,194
Then the music comes in.

426
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,288
''Memories''

427
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,855
Oh my, God, it's so good.

428
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,458
''Light the corners of my mind

429
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,834
''Misty water-coIored memories

430
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,568
''Of the way we were''

431
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,200
Let me do my favorite part.

432
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,973
-''Can it be''
-Yes!

433
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:06,541
''Can it be that it was aII so simpIe then

434
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:10,610
''Or has time re-written every Iine?

435
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:14,755
''If we had the chance to do it aII again

436
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,218
''TeII me

437
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,985
''WouId we?

438
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,062
''CouId we?

439
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,396
''Memories''

440
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,398
I miss James.

441
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,499
Excuse me?

442
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:34,235
After I left my frlends, I found myself
pulled to the slte of the engagement party.

443
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:37,940
I had no lntentlon of golng ln,
but lt was on my way home.

444
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,959
One second.

445
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,057
I had a cholce.

446
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:57,431
I could run or I could stand
and ask hlm the questlon...

447
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:01,232
...that lf I dldn't ask,
would haunt me the rest of my llfe.

448
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,641
I thought by the time I got here,
I'd know what to say.

449
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:05,907
And?

450
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,806
You're Iate.

451
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,909
The party's over.

452
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,742
I'II say it is.

453
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,314
Funny.

454
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,314
I was just on my way home and....

455
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,592
I have a question for you.

456
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,259
Why wasn't it me?

457
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,460
-Carrie--
-No, seriousIy.

458
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,134
I reaIIy need to hear you say it.

459
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,607
Come on, be a friend.

460
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,073
I don't know.

461
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,639
It just got so hard...

462
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,717
...and she's....

463
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,847
Yeah.

464
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,633
''Your girI is IoveIy, HubbeII.''

465
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,533
I don't get it.

466
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,103
And you never did.

467
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,251
Easy, girI.

468
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,926
Then I had a thought,
maybe I dldn't break Blg.

469
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,061
Maybe the problem was
he couldn't break me.

470
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,731
Maybe some women
aren't meant to be tamed.

471
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,800
Maybe they need to run free
untll they flnd someone...

472
