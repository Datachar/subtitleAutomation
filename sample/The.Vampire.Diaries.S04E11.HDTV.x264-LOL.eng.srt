1
00:00:00,685 --> 00:00:03,756
My name is Elena Gilbert,
and I'm a vampire.

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:07,346
I'm learning how to survive,
but there are complications.

3
00:00:07,348 --> 00:00:09,281
I know that I'm
sired to you, Damon.

4
00:00:09,283 --> 00:00:10,449
You know what would
make me happy?

5
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:13,469
That what you actually
felt for me was real.

6
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,788
How together are they?

7
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,008
But there's hope now.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,910
Tell him what the hunter
told you the tattoo leads to.

9
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:23,595
He said there was a cure.

10
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:25,764
And we're not
the only ones who want it...

11
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:27,766
I want to ram it down
Niklaus' throat.

12
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:29,268
But uncovering it
comes with a price.

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,686
What do you know about Silas?

14
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:32,471
He's the world's
first immortal being,

15
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:34,857
who just happens to be
imprisoned with the cure.

16
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,275
You said it yourself, right?

17
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:38,110
Whoever finds the cure first
gets to decide

18
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:39,228
what to do with it.

19
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,696
So what do you say, partners?

20
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:42,648
The race for the cure
has begun,

21
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,616
but how far will we
have to go to find it?

22
00:00:44,618 --> 00:00:47,786
I was beginning to worry you
boys wouldn't find the place.

23
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:48,937
Did you kill all these people?

24
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:51,039
Killing them is your job.

25
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:14,963
Unh!

26
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:16,464
Agh!

27
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:23,489
Jeremy, voice-over: No way.
I'm not doing it.

28
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:25,357
What makes you think
you have a choice?

29
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,310
You have to kill vampires to
complete the hunter's mark.

30
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:29,811
Mark equals cure.

31
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:31,947
You're in a bar full
of almost vampires,

32
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:33,648
so get your hunt on.

33
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,751
Screw you. You said I
wouldn't have to kill

34
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:36,919
any innocent people.

35
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:39,004
Jeremy, they're not people.

36
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:41,123
Enough! Have at it,
or else.

37
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,343
I don't take orders
from you, dick.

38
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:46,879
Hunters can't be compelled.

39
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:53,001
You're right.
I can't compel you,

40
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:54,887
but if your conscience
is getting in the way,

41
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:57,306
then allow me to make
this easy for you

42
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:59,641
because I can compel them.

43
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:04,863
I'm gonna give you a
two-minute head start.

44
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:07,499
Then I'm gonna send every
vampire in here after you.

45
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:12,070
You kill them, or they
kill your friend... Matt.

46
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:13,121
Wait a second.

47
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:15,707
No, no. You turn them,
he kills them.

48
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:16,992
That was the deal, Klaus.

49
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:18,877
I'm taking artistic license.

50
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,196
You know he can't take them
all on at the same time.

51
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:23,415
With you as his
coach, he'll be fine.

52
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:26,418
It's Matt I'm worried about.

53
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,304
Ehh.

54
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:30,889
Jeremy, go get
the weapons out of the car.

55
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:32,724
I'll be right behind you.

56
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:35,510
Go with him.

57
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,564
If I hear an engine start,

58
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,482
I'll kill Matt myself!

59
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,054
Jeremy: Are you ok?

60
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:47,389
Yeah. I just
need a second.

61
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:48,824
We don't have a second.

62
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:50,943
They can smell your blood.
We need to go.

63
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:53,862
[Crunch]

64
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:56,031
Don't hesitate.
You're lucky it was me.

65
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,866
Otherwise, you two
would be dead.

66
00:02:57,868 --> 00:02:59,034
You set us up.

67
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:00,335
I'm was trying to get
this thing over with.

68
00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:01,837
You're the one that
pissed off Klaus.

69
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:04,039
Now you have to fight
your way out of it.

70
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,757
Where are the other vampires?

71
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,259
They're newbies. They're still
trying to figure out how to track,

72
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:10,545
which means you have two
seconds to get ready to fight.

73
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:11,930
The lake house is this way.

74
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:13,849
If we can get there, they
won't be able to get inside.

75
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:16,551
Wait. You want to run?

76
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:19,754
They're gonna kill Matt.

77
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:22,474
Fine. Get out of here.
I'll slow them down.

78
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:39,825
Jeremy, where are you?

79
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:41,793
Keep going.
We're almost there.

00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:51,219

[Snap]

82
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:56,124
Are you ok?

83
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,061
Oh, my God.

84
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:01,063
Get to the house!
Hurry!

85
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,821
Jeremy, what's going on?

86
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:11,306
They're coming.

00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,792
Sun's up.

89
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:32,260
They're long gone.

90
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:36,765
What the hell
were you thinking?

91
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:39,167
All I asked you to do was
to teach him how to fight.

92
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:40,769
He's not the best
student in the world.

93
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:42,304
Wait. Now this is
my fault?

94
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,723
Stop talking.

95
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,858
Look. I know
you're angry,

96
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,727
but my way was the
easiest, fastest,

97
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,313
and safest way
to complete his mark

98
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:52,514
to get you the cure.

99
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:54,566
I don't care
about the cure, Damon,

100
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:57,352
not if it means putting the
people that I love in danger.

101
00:04:57,354 --> 00:04:59,488
Hey. There would
have been no danger

102
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,306
if he hadn't gone
all bleeding heart.

103
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:03,158
He killed someone.

104
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,043
These were innocent people.

105
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:07,295
But the mark grew, didn't it?

106
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:08,964
[Sighs]

107
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:12,417
Ok. Look.
We need a plan.

108
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,302
There's a group of compelled
vampires out there,

109
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:16,088
and as soon as the sun
goes down,

110
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,339
they're gonna come after Matt,

111
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:19,091
so we have to find
a away to protect him.

112
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:22,177
Yes, I know, but there
will be no problem

113
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:25,814
when big Jer and I here go
on a hunting expedition.

114
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:30,268
Elena, I know it's tragic,
I get it,

115
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,387
but we also agree
that he had to kill them.

116
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:34,189
Now we have added incentive,

117
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,775
so you take the least
most valuable player home,

118
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:39,244
and Jeremy and I
will finish this.

119
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:40,445
I'm sorry. Are you
saying that I should

120
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:41,947
leave him here with you?

121
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:44,366
Trust me.

122
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:47,753
I will keep him safe, ok?

[Music playing]

124
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,082
Ahem. I know you were, uh,
daggered for a little while,

125
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:04,436
but, uh, knocking
is still a thing.

126
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:07,355
So is writing in your
diary apparently.

127
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:09,024
I'm just checking for doubts.

128
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:11,143
You can never be too cautious
when it comes to love.

129
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:12,760
One minute, you're begging me

130
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:14,029
to compel Elena from your mind,

131
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:15,930
and the next,
I'm up coffin creek

132
00:06:15,932 --> 00:06:17,098
with a dagger in my back.

133
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,118
Right. Well, you can
read it all you want.

134
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,453
I'm done with her.

135
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:25,273
Until we find the cure, right?

136
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:26,708
Hey. I'm talking
to you.

137
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,277
Oh, I know you are.
I'm ignoring you.

138
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,945
Look. We're at a bit
of a disadvantage

139
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:32,414
in this whole race
for the cure.

140
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,166
Team Klaus has
Jeremy the hunter,

141
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:36,051
team Shane has
Bonnie the witch.

142
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:38,086
If you're here to remind me
of our last place status,

143
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:39,304
I'm very well aware.

144
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:41,122
Actually I have a plan.

145
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:42,674
The cure is buried with Silas,

146
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:45,627
that ancient evil guy my
brother Kol is afraid of.

147
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,146
Shane was so eager
to prove his existence

148
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:51,399
that he gave away that he has on
of the keys to resurrecting him,

149
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:52,967
his headstone.

150
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:55,437
I see. You want to
steal it.

151
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,191
Yes. And then team Shane will
have to join team Rebekah,

152
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:00,992
and team Klaus will be
left out in the cold

153
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:02,577
where he belongs.

154
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,387
You know, just because
your eyes are closed

155
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:13,622
doesn't mean you're meditating.

156
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:15,507
Come on.
Use your breath.

157
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,792
Use your breath
to calm your nerves.

158
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:19,494
Great.

159
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:21,379
So now I can't even
meditate right?

160
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:22,881
What else can I fail?

161
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:24,299
Bonnie, you didn't fail.

that almost killed April.

Exactly. Almost.

Failing would have been
actually killing her.

00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,757
Sheriff?

178
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,925
Bonnie, I'm gonna
need you to go.

179
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:08,093
What the hell are you doing?

180
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:10,011
We need to ask you
a few questions.

181
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:11,313
Are you serious? I'm
sure I can answer

182
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,731
without the handcuffs.

183
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,232
Come on. This isn't
even your jurisdiction.

184
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:16,184
Well, then I guess we better
get you to Mystic Falls asap.

185
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:17,435
Wait. Why are you
doing this?

186
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:19,104
That's something you
should ask your dad.

187
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,892
You really think they
went back to the bar?

188
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:26,561
Where else are they gonna go?

189
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,029
It's all cabins
and vacation homes.

190
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:29,698
They can't get in anywhere.

191
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:36,504
All right.
There you go.

192
00:08:36,506 --> 00:08:41,543
Fine. Let's get this
over with.

193
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:43,077
Listen. Just go
one at a time,

194
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,046
only shoot for the heart,

195
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:46,765
don't hesitate,

196
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:48,300
and don't miss.

197
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:49,517
Save the teaching moment.

198
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,936
Elena's not here.

199
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:53,087
You don't have to pretend like
you give a damn about me.

200
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:56,591
I'm trying to keep you
alive, dumbass.

201
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:57,859
Come on.

202
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:02,530
[Music playing]

203
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:26,638
Something's not right.

204
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,191
Ahh.

205
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:54,315
Looks like we're gonna have
to find some new vampires.

206
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:56,150
What a waste.

207
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:57,585
What the hell happened?

208
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,487
I confess.

209
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:02,040
I did it.

210
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,825
Kol.

211
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:05,176
Jeremy, good to see you, mate.

212
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:06,845
Sorry about the mess.

213
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:08,380
It was a little crowded
when I arrived,

214
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:12,384
and I prefer more
intimate gatherings.

215
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:14,686
We 3 need to have
a little chat.

216
00:10:23,594 --> 00:10:24,911
Care for a drink?

217
00:10:24,913 --> 00:10:27,935
He's underage,
and I don't like you,

218
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,628
so let's just cut to it.

219
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,898
My brother bragged
about his plan

220
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,716
to complete
Jeremy's hunter's mark.

221
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:35,468
It was easy enough
to track this lot down.

222
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,737
They were all hiding
in the shadows.

223
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:40,106
Now killing
young vampires is easy

224
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:42,575
or old ones for that matter.

225
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:44,243
Why? What's it to you
either way?

226
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:46,078
Because, you fools, in your
zeal to find the cure,

227
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,531
you risk waking someone
very dangerous.

228
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:52,535
Oh. You must be talking
about Silas.

229
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:53,819
What do you know of him?

230
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,421
Nothing. Don't want to.
Not our problem.

231
00:10:55,423 --> 00:10:57,757
Isn't it?

232
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,842
A few hundred years back,
I came across a group

233
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:01,093
that worshiped Silas.

234
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,162
His followers told me
that he would rise again,

235
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:06,215
and when he did, he would
trigger the end of all time.

236
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:07,884
You know, being an immortal,
you can see why I'm opposed

237
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:10,269
to time's ending.

238
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:12,288
I murdered all of them,

239
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,391
and now here you are
willing to risk raising him

240
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,143
in your search for the cure.

241
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:19,345
I can't exactly sit back
and let that happen, can I?

242
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:20,980
We're not gonna back off the
cure because you were told

243
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:23,682
one too many scary
bedtime stories, you idiot.

244
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,319
Jeremy, we were
mates in Colorado.

245
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:27,737
You're a smart lad.

246
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:30,189
Why don't you call off this
imbecilic treasure hunt?

247
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:33,709
I'm not calling
anything off, mate.

248
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,997
Well, I could kill you,

249
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:40,583
but then I'd have to deal
with the hunter's curse,

250
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:43,219
and I... I don't particularly
feel like being haunted

251
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:45,871
for the next century.

252
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,056
[Snaps fingers]

253
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:48,174
Better idea.

254
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:49,642
I'll just rip off your arms.

255
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,680
Jeremy, run!

256
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:10,930
Well... Headstone's
not here.

257
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:12,131
Don't ripper out on me.

258
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,500
We'll find it.

259
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:17,236
Oh, you're all bottled up.

260
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:19,171
You need a release.
Maybe we can find you

261
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,541
a voodoo doll or something.

262
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,295
Ah. This should
do the trick.

263
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:28,097
Exactly what you need.

264
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:33,603
The Professor's stash of herbs.

265
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:35,588
Not interested.

266
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,975
What happened to you? You were
so much fun in the twenties.

267
00:12:38,977 --> 00:12:43,596
I was a psychotic killer with
no emotions in the 1920s.

268
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:44,930
You may have been a killer,

269
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,766
but you were far from
emotionless, Stefan.

270
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,269
You had a blast.
I know you remember.

271
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:54,440
The jazz, the booze, our
little table at Gloria's.

272
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,328
Don't make me
compel it out of you.

273
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,285
All right. Um...

274
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,920
I guess we had
a little bit of fun.

275
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:10,423
Thank you. So now that
we've established

276
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:12,925
that fun is, in fact, possible,

277
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:17,496
maybe you'd like to
start having some.

278
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:19,298
Don't worry
about the Professor.

279
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,134
He won't be back any time soon.
I made sure of that.

280
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,695
You're accusing me of
orchestrating a mass murder?

281
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:34,647
Do you know how ridiculous
that sounds.

282
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,749
It's Mystic Falls.

283
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,784
It's actually one of the least
ridiculous things I've heard.

284
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:41,153
Bonnie: He already
explained this, dad.

285
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,506
Pastor young came to him for help.
He was crazy.

286
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:44,990
No. Hew was
grief-stricken,

287
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,509
and Shane took advantage of it.

288
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,377
And somehow talked him into
killing a house full of people.

289
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:49,962
It doesn't make any sense.

290
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:51,764
I've met people
like this, Bonnie.

291
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:53,466
They're fast-talking, they're
charismatic, they're manipulators.

292
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:55,267
They prey
on the weak-minded.

293
00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:00,606
Mmm. And you're worried
that's what he's doing to me.

294
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:02,508
That's why you brought
him in, isn't it?

295
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,861
No. We brought him in because
April young told us what he did.

296
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:07,513
Rebekah Mikaelson confirmed it.

297
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:09,649
He confessed to her.

298
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:10,783
I'm going in there.

299
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:12,034
Bonnie, no, you're not.

300
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:17,123
If he's gonna tell anyone
what he did, it's me.

301
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,525
Unless of course you think
I'm too weak-minded.

302
00:14:27,217 --> 00:14:30,252
Bonnie, now is not the time.

303
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:31,921
Let her talk.

304
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:37,560
I think your dad's
confused about the format

305
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:39,345
of the parent-teacher
conference.

306
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:40,879
I'm so sorry.

307
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,516
Rebekah told them
you confessed.

308
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:45,217
I know she's lying.

309
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:51,824
You know, the truth is,
she's not.

310
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,331
I'm so sorry. Listen.

311
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,117
When I asked you to stay to
Jeremy, I never thought...

312
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,586
what did you expect, Elena?

313
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:04,837
It's Damon.

314
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,238
I never wanted
anyone to get hurt.

315
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,741
Well, then you shouldn't
have left him in charge.

316
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:14,180
Look. I'm sorry. I know you
didn't have a choice...

317

sire bond and all.

318
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,633
Sire bond doesn't
work like that.

319
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:20,469
All I know, Elena,
is that the old you

320
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:22,588
would have never left
Jeremy with Damon,

321
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,808
especially after
what happened last night.

[Cell phone rings]

323
00:15:30,947 --> 00:15:32,097

00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,265
Jeremy: Elena,
we're in trouble.

325
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,035
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

326
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:37,269
Where's Damon?

327
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,704
Listen to me.
Kol attacked us.

328

I barely got away,
but he's got Damon.

329
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,445
A bit ironic you
coming to me for help.

330

Weren't your friends just trying
to bury me in a cement tomb?

331
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:52,635
This is your fault.

332
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:55,254
You started this when you forced
Jeremy to kill those vampires.

333
00:15:55,256 --> 00:15:58,224
And my little brat of a brother
has gone and made things worse.

334
00:15:58,226 --> 00:16:00,826
Well, he never did like Damon.

335
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:04,764
I suppose I should do
something, shouldn't I?

to make demands, love.

Whilst I'd like to cure you
to make more hybrids,

339
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:15,908
I do have other reasons
for finding the cure,

340
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,927
not the least of which
is destroying it

341
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:20,529

use it against me.

Just two days home, and I'm
told you've already gone

347

Come on, Nik. I was
only having some fun.

349

no shortage of people.

351
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:56,365
Where's Damon Salvatore.

352
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:58,067
I gave him a good
and proper beating

353
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:59,735
just for old time's sake.

354
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:01,570
Yes. Well, you've had
your fun.

355
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:03,839
Now let him go and come home.

356
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:06,992
Avoid any more trouble, or you'll
find yourself back in a box.

357
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:08,994
Hey. No need to be
nasty about it.

358
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:11,080
On the contrary, I find
nastiness to be essential

359
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:14,466
whenever my siblings
try to sabotage me.

360
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:17,303
Listen closely, Kol.

361
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:20,172
Stay away from the Gilbert boy.

362
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:21,924
Understand?

363
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:24,393
Fine.
I won't touch him.

364
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:25,878
You have my word.

365
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,184
Very good, darling.

366
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:34,320
Now stab yourself
a little bit further.

367
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:38,908
[Groaning]

368
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,113
If you're gonna kill me,
do it like a man.

369
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:45,497
I don't want to kill you.

370
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,199
I just wanted to make sure
you could be compelled.

371
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:49,668
I'm gonna rip out your spleen.

372
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,037
You ought to be thanking me.

373
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,256
You don't really want
the cure found.

374
00:17:54,258 --> 00:17:57,593
You fancy Elena. I mean, even
more now that she's a vampire.

375
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:59,845
Admit it.

376
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,630
The last vestige
of her humanity

377
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:05,751
is her annoying
little brother Jeremy,

378
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:09,939
and deep, deep down, I bet you
want him dead, don't you?

379
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:14,143
Nope.

380
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:15,861
You're lying.

381
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,364
I bet you'd love to rip
his head right off...

382
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,201
And I'm gonna give
you your wish.

383
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,808
You're not gonna
remember what I say,

384
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,628
but you're going to
find Jeremy Gilbert,

385
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,914
and when you do,

386
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,632
you're going to kill him.

387
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:47,870
Jeremy, it's over.

388
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:49,172
You can put all this away.

389
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:50,757
Klaus still wants me
to finish the mark.

390
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,225
He's not gonna stop.

391
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:54,060
Ok. Well, Damon's
gonna be back soon,

392
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:55,478
and then we can figure
something out.

393
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,846
Seriously?
You still trust Damon?

394
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:58,264
He saved your life.

395
00:18:58,266 --> 00:18:59,766
He saved the map to the cure.

396
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:01,550
He couldn't care less about me.

397
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:03,102
I care about you.

398
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:04,654
Don't.

399
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:06,439
Whatever's inside of me
that makes me want to hunt,

400
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:09,492
right now it's on overdrive.

401
00:19:09,494 --> 00:19:11,160
Jeremy.

402
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:20,419
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:23,089
I know what I have
to do, Elena.

404
00:19:23,091 --> 00:19:24,791
I really want to get
that cure for you,

405
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:26,909
but...

406
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:30,546
I just... I don't how
I'm gonna do this.

408
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:39,138
So much random crap in here.

409
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,774
Crap, maybe.
Random, no.

410
00:19:41,776 --> 00:19:44,777
Looks like Shane has
a bit of an afterlife fetish.

411
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:48,648
Hopi prayer feathers, the
han dynasty soul vase,

412
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,484
and that is a polynesian
sacrificial knife.

413
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:54,153
Brutal way to die, but at
least you appease the gods.

414
00:19:54,155 --> 00:19:56,622
Since when did you become
such an artifact expert?

415
00:19:56,624 --> 00:19:59,292
I enjoy other cultures, Stefan.

416
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:01,160
I know that might be hard
for you to understand

417
00:20:01,162 --> 00:20:04,881
considering you dated a child
who only thinks about herself.

418
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:12,655
Still a sensitive
subject, I see.

419
00:20:12,657 --> 00:20:15,291
Do you know why I wouldn't
compel Elena from your memory?

420
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:17,059
Because you wanted me
to suffer.

421
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:20,429
I did. It's the only
way you'll learn.

422
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,431
It took me a thousand years

423
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:24,066
and hundreds of betrayals
to realize

424
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:28,487
that love, caring ruins you.

425
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:30,323
Hmm.

426
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:31,974
That's awfully bleak.

427
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:34,410
Quite the opposite.

428
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:36,979
It's liberating actually.

429
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:41,167
You know why we had so much
fun in the twenties, Stefan?

430
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,002
Because we didn't care.

431
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:46,488
We just did what felt good...

432
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,661
drinking, feeding, sex.

433
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:56,382
The sex wasn't good
because we didn't care.

434
00:20:56,384 --> 00:20:59,602
It was good because you're crazy.

435
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:03,356
Crazy sex is always good.

436
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:05,775

the model of sanity.

441
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:55,691
What happened?
Are you ok?

442
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:58,861
Kol happened.

443
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:00,229
Thank God you both got away.

Is here? I just want to
talk to him really fast.

00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:07,069
He's at the grill. He
wanted to check on Matt.

447
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:08,237
Well, I should go
apologize to him.

448
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:11,740
I was... I was pretty
tough on him today.

give us a minute.

Yeah. I don't lie.
I'm not you.

Look. I always gonna tell you the truth.
I just kept putting it off

455
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:36,365
because I was worried
how you'd react.

456
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:38,234
Bad. That's how
I react to murder.

where you convince him
to massacre 11 people.

461
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,245
It wasn't a massacre.
It was a ritual.

necessary to raise Silas

friends so desperately want.

had to die...

take him home,

wait till the vervain
is out of his system,

00:27:07,253 --> 00:27:08,603
Your reckless use
of magic is the reason...

530
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:09,854
don't.

531
00:27:09,856 --> 00:27:11,422
Is the reason those spirits

532
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:13,391
are torturing her on the other side.
Don't.

533
00:27:13,393 --> 00:27:16,311
Hurting her again
and again and again.

534
00:27:16,313 --> 00:27:17,979
I said don't!

535
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:21,199
Unh!

536
00:27:21,201 --> 00:27:22,400
My hand!

537
00:27:22,402 --> 00:27:25,103
[Whimpers]

538
00:27:25,105 --> 00:27:28,290
You can't stop, can you?

539
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:31,275
All this power
that you're feeling,

540
00:27:31,277 --> 00:27:34,329
you actually like it,
don't you?

541
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:38,282
Aah! Aah! Ugh.

542
00:27:38,284 --> 00:27:41,136
Look at yourself, Bonnie.
Look at yourself, Bonnie.

543
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:43,454
Bonnie, what are you doing?

544
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:45,623
Get out.

545
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,842
Get out of here.
Bonnie, stop!

546
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:49,394
You can't reason with her, mayor.
She's lost control.

547
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:54,465
Bonnie, baby, baby.
Please.

548
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:57,385
Do something!

549
00:27:57,387 --> 00:27:59,020
Bonnie...

550
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:01,973
Bonnie, look at me!

551
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:03,775
Now take a deep breath.

552
00:28:03,777 --> 00:28:07,078
I'm right here with you.

553
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,031
You are in complete control.

554
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:14,619
That's it.

555
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:37,308
Your daughter...
Is a prodigy.

556
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,729
With my guidance...

557
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:43,848
She'll be one of the most
powerful witches in the world...

558
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:49,788
But without it...
whew...

559
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,073
she's a time bomb.

560
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:56,411
[Cell phone ringing]

561
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:04,586
Hello, Elena.

562
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:06,204
What did you to Stefan?

563
00:29:06,206 --> 00:29:08,256
Rescued him from his
old, dull life,

564
00:29:08,258 --> 00:29:09,557
but it keeps calling.

565
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,375
Stefan's not in the
mood to talk right now.

566
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:12,977
Then he can listen.

567
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:14,846
I know might not care
about me right now, Stefan,

568
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:17,232
but Kol compelled Damon
to kill Jeremy.

569
00:29:17,234 --> 00:29:19,234
They're somewhere in
the tunnels, and I...

570
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:20,652
it's one giant maze down here,

571
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:23,822
and I can't find them, so if
you still care about the cure

572
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:27,175
or about Jeremy, then
maybe you can come help.

573
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:37,068
Ok.

574
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,402
[Beep]

575
00:29:39,622 --> 00:29:41,239
That is an interesting
predicament

576
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:42,841
for both of us.

577
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:48,913
Damon: Did you miss the part
where I said I'm compelled?

578
00:29:48,915 --> 00:29:50,882
Don't stop!

579
00:29:52,718 --> 00:29:53,968
Seriously?

580
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,470
You're being hunted
by a vampire,

581
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:57,255
and now you're bleeding?

582
00:30:06,782 --> 00:30:08,983
Aah!

583
00:30:08,985 --> 00:30:11,069
Dumb move, Jer.

584
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:12,904
You can't fight me
in closed quarters.

585
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:14,105
It was worth a shot.

586
00:30:14,107 --> 00:30:15,824
Aah!

587
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:17,792
Ugh.

588
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:21,880
You're gonna have to shoot
me, Jeremy, in the heart.

589
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:24,132
I'm not gonna be able
to stop myself.

590
00:30:24,134 --> 00:30:27,285
Jeremy, you are a hunter.

591
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:29,471
You know what to do.

592
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:31,556
Do it.

593
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:32,957
Do it!

594
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:46,188
Ow.

595
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,707
Ugh.

596
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:53,963
[Groaning]

597
00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:03,372
He shot me in the head.

598
00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:06,642
Stupid idiot...

599
00:31:06,644 --> 00:31:09,829
Borderline brain-dead moron!

600
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:18,721
That was dumb, Jeremy.

601
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:21,657
Eh.

602
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:24,026
Should have killed me
when you had the chance.

603
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,787
Going somewhere?

604
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:36,172
I would if I were you.

605
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:37,406
If Damon kills the hunter,

606
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:38,608
Nik will not be pleased.

607
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,010
I told Nik I wouldn't
touch the kid.

608
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:42,128
I didn't.

609
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,262
Oh. Well,
that was clever.

610
00:31:43,264 --> 00:31:45,548
I'm sure he'll really
appreciate it.

611
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:51,971
You'd really dagger me?

612
00:31:51,973 --> 00:31:56,309
If I do, Damon's compulsion
ends and this is all over.

613
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:58,060
And then you're no
better than Niklaus.

614
00:31:58,062 --> 00:32:00,529
Daggering siblings when
you disagree with them...

615
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:02,565
look at what this
family has become.

616
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,900
I mean, Elijah won't
even show his face

617
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:07,386
he's so disgusted
by our bickering.

618
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:11,741
This cure has ruined us,

619
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:15,110
and it hasn't even
been found yet.

620
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:18,047
Just imagine what would
happen if it is.

621
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:22,251
This family was ruined long
before we knew about the cure.

622
00:32:24,254 --> 00:32:25,454
Kol!

623
00:32:25,456 --> 00:32:27,473
I won't let you raise Silas.

624
00:32:28,842 --> 00:32:30,810
Enough of this foolishness.

625
00:32:30,812 --> 00:32:32,311
Put it down, Kol.

626
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:37,633
He was going to kill me.

627
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:41,570
Well, then, I think
you need a lesson

628
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:44,106
in how to properly
dagger a sibling.

629
00:32:47,477 --> 00:32:49,362
Burn in hell.

630
00:32:58,755 --> 00:33:00,256
Unh!

631
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:13,836
Damon, stop!

632
00:33:16,023 --> 00:33:19,842
I know that you don't
want to hurt Jeremy,

633
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:24,363
so please stop.

634
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:25,815
I can't.

635
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:27,316
Yes, you can.

636
00:33:27,318 --> 00:33:29,017
You're strong enough
to resist the compulsion.

637
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:31,070
I know that you are.

638
00:33:31,072 --> 00:33:32,655
Why, because Stefan did?

639
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:36,709
Because I love you,
because you love me.

640
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:43,916
You'd do anything for me,
so please...

641
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:45,968
Do this for me.

642
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:02,351
I'm sorry, Elena.

643

00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:48,525
You lost a lot of blood.

[Groaning]

653
00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:54,681
So you bled me out?

654
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:56,816
Yeah. I didn't really
have much of a choice.

655
00:34:56,818 --> 00:34:58,618
Kol's compulsion
is still in effect,

656
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,620
so you need to stay locked up.

657
00:35:00,622 --> 00:35:03,523
We don't have
any vervain, so...

658
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:05,825
This was the only way
I could weaken you.

659
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:09,663
You sound
real torn up about it.

660
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:12,582
Shouldn't we be going
after Kol,

661
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:14,868
make him decompel me.

662
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,070
Yeah, yeah, sure. That
sounds easy enough, Damon.

663
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:18,538
I'll get right on that.

00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:24,844
At least let me see Elena.

667
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:27,263
Come on. You know
you can't do that.

668
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:28,765
With the sire bond,
all you have to do

669
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:30,350
is tell her to
let you out of here.

670
00:35:30,352 --> 00:35:33,019
It's too risky.

671
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:34,988
You're really enjoying
this, aren't you?

672
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,906
It's better for Elena if
you stay in here for now,

673
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:38,558
at least until we
find the cure,

674
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,493
and then once she's
no longer sired

675
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:43,580
and you're no longer compelled,

676
00:35:43,582 --> 00:35:46,533
you can both do whatever
the hell you want.

00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:11,524
I need to talk to him.

682
00:36:11,526 --> 00:36:13,827
Well, you can't. He'll just
ask you to let him out.

683
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:15,061
I won't let him out.

684
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:17,030
You won't have a choice.

685
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:18,615
You're sired.

That all?

00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,791
Stefan, what are you
doing with Rebekah?

688
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:29,459
She tried to kill me.

689
00:36:29,461 --> 00:36:31,044
And this will be
the second time that

690
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:33,747
Damon tried to kill Jeremy.

691
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:36,499
So I guess nobody's
perfect, right?

692
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:42,005

I can apologize.

00:37:50,692 --> 00:37:51,858
Are you kidding me?

711
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,027
I got angry I admit,

712
00:37:54,029 --> 00:37:55,495
but I knew what I was doing.

713
00:37:55,497 --> 00:37:59,198
You lost control,
and Shane said...

714
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,553
didn't we just establish
that we couldn't trust him?

715
00:38:03,555 --> 00:38:04,921
He's trying to get
under your skin.

716
00:38:04,923 --> 00:38:07,590
The only thing that got under
my skin is what I saw,

717
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:11,261
which is my daughter
using dangerous magic!

718
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:12,762
And the fact that you
don't think you need help

719
00:38:12,764 --> 00:38:14,931
means you need it even more.

720
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,781
Good evening, Gilbert clan.

721
00:38:31,783 --> 00:38:32,999
What do you want, Klaus?

722
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:35,251
I've come to fetch my hunter.

723
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:36,603
Seeing as how my brother's
become a liability,

724
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,789
Jeremy will be safer with me.

725
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,174
I think I'll pass.

726
00:38:41,176 --> 00:38:43,076
I've killed enough
people for you today.

727
00:38:43,078 --> 00:38:46,396
You think you're
safer here? Hmm.

728
00:38:46,398 --> 00:38:47,997
Clearly you don't know Kol.

729
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:49,382
He'll stop at nothing
to get what he wants,

730
00:38:49,384 --> 00:38:51,584
so strange as it may seem,
I'm your best bet.

731
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:55,271
Sorry, but I think we'd
rather take our chances.

732
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:02,729
Fine, but when Kol does come...

733
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:04,898
and he will come...

734
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,699
be sure to let me know,

735
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:09,235
preferably before he burns
your nice little home

736
00:39:09,237 --> 00:39:10,954
to the ground.

737
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:15,408
And as for you, hunter,

738
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,243
there's no shortage
of people to turn

739
00:39:17,245 --> 00:39:20,613
and loved ones to
threaten, so sleep well.

740
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:23,283
We'll plan on finishing
our work tomorrow.

741
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,682
[Door opens]

742
00:39:39,684 --> 00:39:41,133
Sure. Just barge
right in.

743
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:45,137
Oh. I thought not
knocking was our thing.

744
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:46,823
You didn't dagger Kol.

745
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:49,275
Well, the white oak stake
pointed at my heart

746
00:39:49,277 --> 00:39:51,244
made things a little difficult.

747
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:55,281
I do believe my brother Kol
has finally lost his mind.

748
00:39:55,283 --> 00:39:57,333
That's all right.
Jeremy's still alive,

749
00:39:57,335 --> 00:40:00,987
and I took care of Damon.

750
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:04,123
So where'd you put it?

751
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,992
The headstone?
Mm-hmm.

752
00:40:05,994 --> 00:40:07,176
Some place safe.

753
00:40:07,178 --> 00:40:08,511
Wasn't really our deal.

754
00:40:08,513 --> 00:40:11,130
Well, considering that
you've betrayed me twice

755
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:13,850
and I've betrayed you never,

756
00:40:13,852 --> 00:40:15,501
I think I'm acting brilliantly,

757
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:18,972
especially since we have no idea
why that guy was looking for it.

758
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:22,976
Did you work things out
with Elena?

759
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:24,343
Do you care?

760
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:27,513
Nope. Just trying to figure
out why you're here.

761
00:40:27,515 --> 00:40:29,482
Do you even have to ask?

762
00:40:32,486 --> 00:40:36,873
No feelings, no attachments.

763
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:39,492
None...

764
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:41,210
Whatsoever.

765
00:40:52,923 --> 00:40:55,058
This is never gonna end.

766
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,542
If Kol doesn't kill me first,

767
00:40:56,544 --> 00:40:59,796
then Klaus is just gonna force
me to kill more innocent people.

768
00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:03,232
How many is it
gonna take, 10, 100?

769
00:41:07,488 --> 00:41:10,323
If you kill one
original vampire,

770
00:41:10,325 --> 00:41:13,225
their entire sire line
will die with them.

771
00:41:13,227 --> 00:41:14,494
That's thousands,

772
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:19,248
maybe tens of thousands
of vampires.

773
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,902
Kol compelled Damon
to kill you.

774
00:41:22,904 --> 00:41:25,054
You're gonna kill Kol instead.

775
00:41:30,592 --> 00:41:36,159
