00:00:03,654 --> 00:00:06,456
(Whispers):
Oh, my God!

2
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:10,126
(Sighs)

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,532
(Snoring)

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,900
Oh, you kissed her! You idiot!

5
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:20,503
You...

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,904
(Groans)

7
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:23,005
(High-pitched gasp)

8
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:31,146
No, no, no.
(Muffled shrieking)

9
00:00:31,214 --> 00:00:32,815
I wasn't doing anything.
I wasn't. No, no, no.

10
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:34,816
I wasn't doing anything,
I wasn't doing anything, I...

11
00:00:34,884 --> 00:00:36,250
(Whispering):
Do not walk away from me.

12
00:00:36,318 --> 00:00:38,286
Do not. You are not.

13
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:40,187
You're doing it. Nick?

14
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:41,255
- Shamone.
- He did.

15
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:46,795
(Sighs)

16
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:48,530
(Yawning)

17
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:51,465
(Both yawning loudly)

18
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:52,933
Oh.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,935
Ugh, my God.

20
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:56,537
Oh, I just woke up.

21
00:00:56,604 --> 00:00:58,739
I've been sleeping
for hours and hours.

22
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:00,541
Nice. Me, too.

23
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:02,342
Let's see here.

24
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:06,278
Oh, sweet. Ten e-mails.

25
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:11,818
Hey, Sam, um...

26
00:01:12,585 --> 00:01:13,619
I have to tell
you something.

27
00:01:13,687 --> 00:01:16,355
How do you always look
so beautiful in the morning?

28
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:18,458
Sometimes I can't
even look at you.

29
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,259
I can't even--
I got to look away.

30
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,693
I can't even look
at you right now.

31
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:23,628
Wait, but I got to.
Now I got to look away.

32
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:25,931
I just can't resist.
Oh, geez.

33
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:27,200
(Laughs)

34
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:28,990
What were you gonna say?

35
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,403
Nothing.

36
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:34,005
It was nothing.

37
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:36,908
Jess?

38
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:38,076
Nick kissed me.

39
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:42,413

(Whistles)

45
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:53,891
(Groans):
Oh, man. Okay.

46
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,593
I had the best sex of
my life last night.

47
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,161
Winston, I'm glad you're here.
We need to talk.

48
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,229
Yeah. Daisy said I was
pretty good.

49
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:01,198
You hear that?
Pretty good!

50
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:02,065
This is important.

51
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,700
And I ain't even use my hands.

52
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:04,807
You didn't use your hands?

53
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:06,403
Well, just I did a lot
of side stuff.

54
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:07,371
Okay, Winston,
you're killing me.

55
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:08,872
I really need to talk to you,

56
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,019
and now after hearing that,
I can barely look at you.

57
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,541
Well, I got
my mojo back, baby!

58
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:14,743
I'm the Mojo Man!

59
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:17,413
Mojo Man, Mojo Man.
I like the sound of that.

60
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:19,015
Yeah, we're not gonna be
getting to my thing, are we?

61
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:20,649
(Whispers):
Mo-Mo-Mojo Man.

62
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:21,717
I got to tell Sam.

63
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:23,319
I can't tell Sam!

64
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:24,487
I didn't even do anything wrong!

65
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:25,654
Nick kissed me!

66
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:27,822
I didn't even kiss him back!

67
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,590
Okay, fine!
I kissed him back!

68
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:30,925
Is that what
you want me to say?

69
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:32,293
I literally
haven't said a word

70
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,828
for, like, over an hour.
(Groans)

71
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:35,176
And now he won't
even talk to me,

72
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:36,631
'cause I saw him this morning

73
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,599
and he just panic
moonwalked away from me.

74
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:39,907
- He what?
- He does that sometimes.

75
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:42,936
Man. Terrorism.

76
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:48,008
And then... ha!

77
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:49,776
Nick just... He just...

78
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:50,844
Kisses you.

79
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:52,312
Stupid Nick Miller. (Grunts)

80
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,260
How was it? Was it...?

81
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:54,714
I was like Scarlett O'Hara

82
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,583
in my freaking curtain dress...

83
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:57,884
How did he do it?

84
00:02:57,952 --> 00:03:00,086
- He just, like, grabbed me.
- Uh-huh.

85
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:01,754
- And he just took me.
- Oh, yeah.

86
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:03,256
I mean, he was a man
and I was a woman.

87
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:05,824
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- It was firm, but tender.

88
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:07,360
- Oh, damn.
- Yeah, I mean,

89
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,108
I saw thorough space and time
for a minute,

90
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:10,430
but that's not the point.

91
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:11,830
Oh, man!

92
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:12,831
Are you okay?

93
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:14,799
I miss sex!

94
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,669
I've been on dates set up by
my mother for the past month.

95
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:19,371
- Mm.
- I mean, what are you gonna do?

96
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,173
(Groans)
I mean, do you...

97
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,174
like Nick?

98
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,109
Ah! Bah!

99
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:25,110
Mm-hmm.
(Laughs)

100
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:26,878
Nah! Neh?

101
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:28,280
(Giggles):
Nick?

102
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:29,281
(Laughs)

103
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:30,681
No.

104
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:32,383
(Chuckles)

105
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:33,784
I don't like Nick.

106
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,052
- Mm-hmm.
- I like Sam, 'cause

107
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,853
Sam's the kind of guy
who fixes things

108
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:38,289
that you didn't even know
were broken.

109
00:03:38,356 --> 00:03:40,057
And Nick is the
type of guy

110
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,458
who breaks things... that are...

111
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:45,162
He breaks things!

112
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,762
Look at that.
It's for my grandma.

113
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,664
Wow, that's... oh, no.

114
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,266
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What are you-- Nick!

115
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:52,001
- No, let me just...
- Nick, Nick, what are you...?

116
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,069
- Okay, here, it's fine.
- No!

117
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:54,737
Nick, what are you...?

118
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:57,807
I think those
belong back on it.

119
00:03:57,874 --> 00:04:00,176
He is not getting in the way
of me and Sam.

120
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:02,078
He is not ruining this.

121
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:03,479
- Mm.
- So mad at him.

122
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:04,846
I can't even be around him.

123
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,081
Can I just spend
the day with you?

124
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:07,516
Oh.

125
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:09,618
Well, um...

126
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:13,018
Okay, I didn't tell you this
before, actually, but, uh...

127
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,190
SCHMIDT:
<i>Cece is going to</i>

128
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:16,691
an Indian marriage
convention today

129
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,459
to find herself
a brown husband.

130
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:19,827
Now, little
does she know

131
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,196
that I have signed up
for the same convention.

132
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:23,897
Gentlemen, there is
nothing that says

133
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:26,100
white men need not apply.

134
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:27,568
You look like
the fortune teller in <i>Big.</i>

135
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:29,103
Wait a second,
is it in the loft?

136
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,871
Yes, Nick.

137
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,341
The West Coast's premiere
Indian singles event,

138
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:35,675
where 300 eligible
Rajput Indians get together

139
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,710
to see if they should get
arranged-married to each other,

140
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,346
is in our loft.

141
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,780
So if it's not,
then I'm coming with.

142
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,682
I'm in, Schmidty.
You finally got company.

143
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,784
- I'm coming. Let's do it.
- The Mojo Man is in, too.

144
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,419
Mojo Man, Mojo Man.

145
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,021
Okay, neither of you are coming.

146
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,589
I've been studying up
for a full week.

147
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,190
I can actually speak
conversational Hindi.

148
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,359
If that conversation is:
"Hello." "Hello."

149
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,127
"Samosa?"
"Yes, please, Samosa."

150
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,562
"More towels?"
"Do you know where

151
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,896
the white person's
toilet is?"

152
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,325
After that,
it gets very confusing.

153
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,566
Can you drive in that dress?

154
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,401
You're right, I can't.

155
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,109
- All right, you're driving. Let's go.
- Yeah!

156
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:11,209
Hi, I'm-I'm checking in.

157
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,443
My name's Cecilia Parikh.

158
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,011
This is my best friend.

159
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,547
She's just, she's just
here to watch.

160
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,215
All must participate.

161
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,217
We've had a lot of
trouble with watchers.

162
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,820
You participate
or you go home.

163
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:28,225
All right, you know what?
What the hell.

164
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:29,926
You're going to have to
fill out a questionnaire.

165
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:31,795
Information,
education, resume.

166
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:32,629
(Chuckles)

167
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:33,963
Done.

168
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,632
Thank you.

169
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:38,467
(Gasps)

170
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:40,769
What the hell are
you guys doing here?

171
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,505
You look like a character
from <i>The Love Guru.</i>

172
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:44,006
Aw, thank you.

173
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:45,874
Hello.

174
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,010
I'd like to check in
with my two friends here.

175
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:49,645
Look, we are not Indian,
but you cannot turn us away,

176
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:52,480
because I read the Website
vigorously, <i>kumari.</i>

177
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:53,416
- Oh, God.
- That means "miss."

178
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:55,217
My friend right there?

179
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:56,885
Yeah, he's a <i>vakeel.</i>
That means "lawyer."

180
00:05:56,952 --> 00:05:58,019
I dropped out
of ka-heel school.

181
00:05:58,087 --> 00:05:59,454
SCHMIDT:
It's <i>vakeel,</i> man.

182
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:01,856
What are you doing here?

183
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:04,092
Oh, no. I just-- uh, yeah...

184
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:06,127
Oh!

185
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:07,995
Nick, you're
embarrassing me.

186
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:11,497
WINSTON: Nick,
what are you doing?

187
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:14,329
WINSTON:
Nick, Nick.

188
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:16,629
N-N-N-Nick, what
are you doing?

189
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,431
Stop moonwalking, man.
(Groans)

190
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:20,133
Man, you have been
weird all morning.

191
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:22,568
Hey, look, I kissed Jess.

192
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:26,972
Say what you're gonna say.

193
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,508
(Groans):
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

194
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,110
Whoo!

195
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:33,045
I thought that's
what you were gonna say.

196
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:34,413
I don't want a new roommate.

197
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,181
Look, don't...
She's not moving out.

198
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:37,533
I'm not talking about her.
Hell no, not her!

199
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,768
I'm talking about you.

200
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:40,119
When this thing blows
up in your face--

201
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:41,603
and it will blow up
in your face, Nick--

202
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:42,771
you're the one moving out.

203
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:45,006
You think I like
living with you?

204
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:47,341
You have centipedes
living under your bed!

205
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,678
- Those weren't centipedes.
- You've named your testicles,

206
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,465
- and they're both named Sharon.
- Yeah, so what?

207
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,347
I can't believe you kissed Jess!
Man, what were you thinking?

208
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:54,895
Look, man, I wasn't
thinking anything.

209
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,679
Nick, just apologize and
make it right, all right?

210
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:03,123
All right.
That's what I'm gonna do.

211
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:06,127
(Groans)

212
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,127
Oh, Sharon!

213
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:08,195
- Get! Just...
- Get...?

214
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,429
Get over here now.

215
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:10,898
Wait. What?

216
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:13,067
You told me you had moved on.

217
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:15,835
Only people who haven't moved
on say things like that.

218
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,670
I'm a squirrel.
You're my nut.

219
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,899
Winter's coming. I'm gonna
store you in my cheek, girl.

220
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,607
Please leave.

221
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,643
You and I not being together
does not make sense to me.

222
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,180
I miss your body

223
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,647
and the things I
used to do to it.

224
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,215
- Schmidt.
- I'm talking about sex.

225
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:34,086
Today is about me finding
someone within my own culture

226
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,287
that I can build my life with.

227
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,256
It's about more than sex.

228
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,657
Our sex was about
more than sex.

229
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,096
It was about
history and memory

230
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,296
and thousands of years
of colonial suffering

231
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:49,399
all being released in one
moment of pure ecstasy.

232
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:51,869
Then why did the sex
always end with you yelling,

233
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:53,938
"Blammo, that happened"?

234
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:56,073
Blammo.

235
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:59,176
Thank you.

236
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:01,612
Hey.

237
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,246
Oh, you can walk
normally now, I see.

238
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:04,680
I'm sorry I kissed you.

239
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:06,549
Well, oh, wow.

240
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:07,917
That was unexpected.

241
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:09,652
Thanks, Nick.

242
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,821
- You know what, it was a mistake.
- I feel better.

243
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,223
- 'Cause, yeah, I was feeling awkward.
- Yeah, good.

244
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,390
(Chuckles):
Right.

245
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,992
You were acting
a little bit weird,

246
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,893
but honestly, for me,
it was, like, a nothing kiss.

247
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:19,995
You know, it was like
kissing a cousin.

248
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:21,329
It was so nonsexual
and nothing.

249
00:08:21,897 --> 00:08:24,633
Well... I think it
meant something.

250
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,568
You know, to you,
'cause you kissed me.

251
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:28,470
Mm-mm.

252
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:31,006
I think you can admit it
meant something to you, Nick.

253
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:33,175
Oh, no, I-I'm telling you,
it meant nothing to me.

254
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:34,275
- I think it did.
- No, no.

255
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:36,310
I do things
I don't mean all the time.

256
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:37,678
Like this. You see this?
Bottle of water.

257
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:39,013
Why did I do that?
I don't know.

258
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:40,815
It doesn't mean anything.

259
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:43,084
I think you can admit that
it meant something to you.

260
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:45,486
- Hey, Jessica, it didn't.
- Hmm.

261
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:48,055
It was a drinking game,
and I was finishing the game.

262
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,556
Yeah, but it happened
after the game

263
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:51,291
when it meant something.

264
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:53,860
- Oh, so it meant something to <i>you?</i>
- What?

265
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:55,862
- It meant something to you.
- No, don't...

266
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,864
If you think some
stupid, terrible kiss...

267
00:08:57,932 --> 00:08:59,599
- You're thinking about
it right now!      - No!

268
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,868
- I'm calling Sam and...
- Oh, you're calling Sam right now?

269
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:03,569
He's gonna come here
and pick me up,

270
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:05,371
- and, uh, we're leaving.
- Oh, you are?

271
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,940
Why are you running away?
Because it meant something?

272
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,442
We're not going anywhere.

273
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,945
Meant nothing, Nick!

274
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:15,247
HOST (Over speaker): Please look
at the numbers on your name tags

275
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:17,516
and go to the table
with the corresponding numbers.

276
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,285
These are your groupings.

277
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:21,486
People with similar resumes
and education backgrounds

278
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:23,054
have been grouped together.

279
00:09:23,122 --> 00:09:25,924
34, 34, thir...

280
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:26,958
Table 34!

281
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,093
We're at the same table!

282
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:31,229
- So this is rock bottom.
- I mean, call me crazy,

283
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:33,397
but I think we're all
getting married tonight.

284
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:35,533
- Yeah, um...   - The money table
right here, Table 34!

285
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,302
Hi, excuse me, I think
that there's been

286
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,336
just a little bit of a
mistake with the tables.

287
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:41,205
Over 30, no advanced degrees,

288
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:43,240
part-time employment:
Table 34.

289
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:45,242
No, see, actually, I'm-I'm
a professional model.

290
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,844
I'm not famous
or anything,

291
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:49,246
but I was in Lil
Wayne's last video.

292
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:51,882
I was the girl he was throwing
strawberries at in slow motion.

293
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:54,851
(Chuckles)

294
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:56,719
Definitely Table 34.

295
00:09:58,088 --> 00:09:59,989
(Sighs)

296
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,724
Excuse me?

297
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,425
Uh, I didn't get
assigned a table.

298
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:05,427
Now, I know exactly
what this is about...

299
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:08,130
But I did assign you a seat.

300
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:10,798
This one. Lap number one.

301
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,969
Okay, so this is not
a racial thing?

302
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:15,403
Not yet, it isn't.

303
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:17,038
Ah.

304
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:18,639
I see what's
happening here.

305
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:20,608
You're feeling my mojo.

306
00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:24,009
You look like a jumpy cat,
and I like that.

307
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,314
Ooh, I like that.

308
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:28,482
(Gasps)

309
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:30,550
Like oversized
blueberries.

310
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:31,551
(Clicks tongue)

311
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:32,652
(Sighs)

312
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,755
Mojo off. Mojo off.

313
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:37,291
Schmidt, Table Seven,
Table Seven.

314
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,826
- What're you doing? You're at Table Seven, too?
- Hmm? I'm at Table Seven.

315
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:41,228
(Sighs)

316
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:41,928
What?

317
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:44,197
Well, you should feel complimented.
I feel slightly insulted.

318
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:45,765
- What?
- No offense.

319
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:47,767
A lot of offense taken.
Well, I'm just saying...

320
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:49,468
- A lot.
- Jess!

321
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:50,536
- Hi!
- Hi.

322
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:52,071
- How are you?
- Um, okay.

323
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:54,507
Yeah, I checked in.
Uh, they gave me my table.

324
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:56,475
- Okay.
- This is a weird date.

325
00:10:56,543 --> 00:10:58,210
I always thought
we'd go bowling before we went

326
00:10:58,278 --> 00:10:59,677
to an Indian marriage
convention.

327
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:01,380
- What table are you at?
- Uh, Table One, I think.

328
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:04,249
Table One?! It's almost like
you save lives or something.

329
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:05,517
Oh, wait, you do.

330
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,221
Let's start the icebreakers.

331
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,756
This exercise shows
how physically compatible

332
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:12,924
two people can be.

333
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:27,405
Ow! My hand!

334
00:11:27,472 --> 00:11:28,439
What?

335
00:11:28,506 --> 00:11:29,740
Stupid man.

336
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:31,607
Nice.

337
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:32,909
- Yeah.
- Ready?

338
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:34,144
Three, two, ow.

339
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,112
- Ow! No, no. Let's...
- Up?

340
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,315
- No, you go down.
- All right. I go down?

341
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:40,683
Kind of just got
to get in a little closer.

342
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:41,484
JESS:
Okay, I'm trying.

343
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:43,353
Seriously.

344
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,324
Hey, dummy.

345
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:51,226
Stop pointing your finger at me.
That's so annoying.

346
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,995
Why are you drinking my beer?

347
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:55,730
You point that finger at me
one more time, I'm...

348
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,466
Why don't you just admit that
that kiss meant something to you?

349
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,134
- No, no!   - I could tell it meant
something, so admit it

350
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:00,436
or I'll do this all day.
I'll do it all day.

351
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,636
HOST:
Next challenge: Make a table

352
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:05,773
out of nothing
but newspaper and tape.

353
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:08,476
Women look to your left,
men to the right.

354
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:09,777
These are your partners.

355
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,412
Oh, you got to
be kidding me.

356
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,114
First table that can hold
a phone book wins.

357
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:14,748
All right, so we have
to make a table.

358
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:15,950
Okay.

359
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,151
- Give me the tape.
- No.

360
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:22,189
I'll tell you what's not
made out of newspaper,

361
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,691
that tight little
ass of yours.

362
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:26,893
Jess, you liked kissing me!
It's fine to say that.

363
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:28,928
No, I didn't.
I'm not on my knee asking you

364
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:30,630
to marry me; It was a nice kiss.

365
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:33,200
You were like a dog and my mouth

366
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:35,601
was like a bowl full of
dog... milk!

367
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,069
It was like a damn fairy tale,
that kiss!

368
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:38,871
It was the best kiss
of your life.

369
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,439
- Are you serious, Nick?
- And you have to take

370
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:42,441
a little responsibility,
tarting around in that

371
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:45,650
- little soft pink robe, not expecting
to get kissed.   - Tarting around?

372
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:47,513
I'm a man, Jessica!

373
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,715
- What?
- Pink robes are my catnip.

374
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:51,549
And we have a winning couple!

375
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:53,118
BOTH:
We are not a couple!

376
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:55,520
- We're not a couple.
- And this is a very bad table.

377
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:57,055
- Terrible table.
- And stop clapping, everybody.

378
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:58,990
- This is awful.
- Look. It won't hold anything.

379
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,159
Be prepared to laugh!

380
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:03,561
No, I mean,
this is, like...

381
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:04,729
NICK:
I got it, I got it.

382
00:13:04,796 --> 00:13:06,530
Here, put it down.
Just-- okay.

383
00:13:06,597 --> 00:13:08,999
Very weak table.

384
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,134
Break!

385
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:14,204
It's a strong table.

386
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:16,440
Strong table, strong couple.

387
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:19,076
Come on. Jump up, yeah.
Jump up! Jump up! Jump up!

388
00:13:19,144 --> 00:13:20,444
- Whoa! Come on.
- Wow.

389
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:22,578
- Wow, yeah. It's real, man.
- Come on.

390
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:23,812
That's an impressive table!

391
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:29,995
Congratulations on winning the
table-building competition, baby.

392
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:32,514
- Yeah, it didn't mean anything, so...
- I didn't think it meant anything.

393
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:34,548
- Yeah, no, just--
- Nick just drives me crazy.

394
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,284
- It's like-- you know?
- Yeah, I mean, I never...

395
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:39,152
- Well, yeah, that's just...
- That's what I was saying.

396
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,353
Is there something
I should know here?

397
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:42,155
No. 'Cause...
(Bell dings)

398
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:43,023
HOST:
Men, switch seats!

399
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,424
No. Sam, stop.

400
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,359
'Cause...
No, I want to talk to you.

401
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:48,161
- Sam, I...
- Do you like field hockey?

402
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:50,496
I... Yeah. Yeah.

403
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:55,034
- Hi!
- Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie. Pass.

404
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,002
So, when did you decide
to become a model?

405
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,504
Oh. Didn't really
think about it at all.

406
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,173
Someone just said they'd pay me
for being pretty, so...

407
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,542
- I like your hat.
- Shh.

408
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,078
- It's my favorite color.
- Shh...

409
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,581
- I didn't say anything.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

410
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:12,383
So how many children
do you want?

411
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,754
Well, I have to start soon, so
I guess I'll just jump right in.

412
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:18,556
So, do you think through
any of your decisions

413
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:19,991
or do you always just
do whatever you want?

414
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,093
Hey! M. Night Shyamalan.

415
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,262
I got a twist ending
for you: Shut up.

416
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:26,230
- What do you want, Table Seven?
- Schmidt, just talk to your girl.

417
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:27,965
- Hi!
- You better watch it, buddy.

418
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:29,767
'Cause I will, I will
Cal-cut-a-bitch up in here.

419
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:32,136
- I will Cal-cut-a-bitch.
- Schmidt!

420
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:33,937
Don't worry, Ben Affleck.
I'm not desperate.

421
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,472
I don't date below Table Six.

HOST:
Time's up. Switch places.

423
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:38,842
Sam...

424
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:42,311
That was not nice.
He crossed a line.

425
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:44,380
Schmidt, you said
you would leave me alone.

426
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:45,681
- You said you would leave...
- He crossed a line.

427
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:47,070
You said you would
leave me alone.

428
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:51,287
(Chuckles)

429
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:53,189
Funny seeing you here.

430
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:56,491
Hey.

431
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:57,859
You have to go.

432
00:14:57,927 --> 00:14:58,961
Yeah, you have to go over there.

433
00:14:59,228 --> 00:15:00,496
Okay. Bye-bye.

434
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:02,063
Go now. Hi.

435
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:05,867
Um, Sam, I do have
something to tell you.

436
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,838
You know why we're at Table 34?

437
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:13,239
'Cause we're both bad at life,
but we have model good looks.

438
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:15,843
It's 'cause we don't
think things through.

439
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:18,378
You didn't think it through
when you kissed Jess.

440
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:21,748
She told me. It's like we just
make these impulsive decisions,

441
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:24,651
and all we end up doing
is hurting other people.

442
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:28,689
I can't believe this.

443
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:29,790
No. No, Sam...

444
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:33,326
Sam? Wait.

445
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:34,327
Sam, wait.

446
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:35,895
I'm really sorry.

447
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:37,430
I said I wanted
to commit to this.

448
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:38,798
I thought you understood
what that meant.

449
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:40,466
JESS:
I do. I did.

450
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:42,368
Hey, hey.
Sam, listen.

451
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:43,703
JESS: What?
- Sam, hear me out.

452
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,338
I kissed her, okay?

453
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:46,905
She didn't kiss me.

454
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:49,174
It didn't mean anything to her.

455
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:50,742
Thank you.

456
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,710
(Grunts)

457
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:53,545
Oh, my God!

458
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:55,780
(Groans) I'm sorry, Nick.
It's the training.

459
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:57,449
He's in such terrible shape!
You could've killed him.

460
00:15:57,516 --> 00:15:58,717
(High-pitched): I'm gonna
kick your ass, man.

461
00:15:58,784 --> 00:16:00,219
SAM: Jess, it may
not have meant something

462
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:01,920
to you, but it meant
something to me.

463
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:04,722
Is there another doctor
in the house?!

464
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,390
With this crowd, I'm sure.

465
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,043
I'm done. So...

466
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:12,046
Good-bye, Jess.

467
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:13,915
No. Sam.

468
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:18,352
Ice it, 24 hours.

469
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,687
And keep it elevated.

470
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,457
- He even exits cool.
- Oh, God.

471
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,945
Anu? I got
something for you.

472
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:31,598
Now, this is Freddy.

473
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,466
As you can see,
he has the exact

474
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,301
same build as me,
all right?

475
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,571
And he is totally available.
Ain't that right, Freddy?

476
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,040
That is what I call
an arranged bang.

477
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:42,875
(Makes explosion noise)

478
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:46,276
Freddy, are you scared of being
confined in small spaces?

479
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:52,682
Oh, you'll do just fine.

480
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:56,337
Now, just remember,
wherever you are,

481
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:58,472
the Mojo Man is there.

482
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:07,315
(Sighs)

483
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:09,616
Damn it, Schmidt.

484
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,188
I'm taking this.

485
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:17,588
Excuse me. Excuse me! Hold up!

486
00:17:17,926 --> 00:17:19,726
You know, when I
came here today,

487
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:21,761
I thought India was
a pretty cool country.

488
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,297
You guys are obviously smart.

489
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:25,764
You l-looked at the roof
of a bus and you said,

490
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,301
"That's not just a roof,
that's more seating."

491
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:31,701
Kal Penn, he's a genius.
Thank you for him.

492
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:33,472
But what I didn't know

493
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,175
is that you're a country
full of blind idiots.

494
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,276
- Oh, God.
- Because in your midst

495
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:39,911
walks a brown angel.

496
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:41,813
That woman. Right there.

497
00:17:43,582 --> 00:17:45,150
I may be an idiot,

498
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:47,285
but I'm smart enough
to know what I lost.

499
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:50,722
You people could've had it all.

500
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:53,624
And you shoved her over there
at a table with Nick.

501
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:57,261
Get your crap together, India.

502
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:59,263
Schmidt...

503
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:01,265
out!

504
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,167
(Crowd murmuring)

505
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:07,905
Hello. I didn't
see you over here.

506
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:09,673
I would love to...

507
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:10,908

508
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:12,308
Sorry I didn't
see you earlier.

509
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:13,910
SCHMIDT: Okay.
They're all-- okay.

510
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:15,511
You don't all have
to run over there at once.

511
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:17,380
I mean, she... she's not
that great, you guys.

512
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:19,883
I mean, she's
kind of old.

513
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,451
You should see her areolas--
one's like a helicopter pad,

514
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,286
the other one's
like a, you know, like...

515
00:18:23,354 --> 00:18:24,588
like a tick bite.

516
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:26,890
It's freaky. Very disorienting.

♪ Oh, yeah ♪

525
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:47,208
How's that?

526
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:50,044
You know when you get dumped and
you're, like, racking your brain

527
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:52,380
for what was it
that I did wrong?

528
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,315
Well, this is a really
unique situation

529
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,184
in that I don't have to do that.

530
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:59,420
Well, what happened?
(Music stops)

531
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:02,188
I'm sorry. I know what--
I know that it's my fault.

532
00:19:02,256 --> 00:19:03,657
I didn't mean
it like...

533
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,200
(Sighs)

534
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:06,660
Jess, can I say something

535
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,362
- that'll potentially not
help this situation?  - No.

536
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,998
I've never been
a home-wrecker.

537
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:14,535
And I liked it.

538
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:17,503
I mean, Sam was
threatened by me.

539
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:18,471
(Chuckles)

540
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,540
I mean, I see that as a victory.

541
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:25,408
But in-in more important...

542
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:31,680
uh, ways, a huge, huge,
devastating loss.

543
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:32,517
For you.

544
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:34,986
Should I call Cece?

545
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:36,120
This feels like Cece territory.

546
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:37,622
This isn't Nick territory.

547
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,590
This is, uh...

548
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:43,361
Look, Jess...

549
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,465
I'm sorry, okay,

550
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:48,999
that I kissed you.

551
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,568
But I shouldn't have done it,

552
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:52,235
because it was obviously
a mistake,

553
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:54,404
and now you're crying and...

554
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:56,874
I won't do it again.

555
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:00,210
Well...
(Sniffles)

556
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:04,611
maybe it was a little bit broken
to begin with.

557
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:06,683
- What happened?
- He just...

558
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,819
He always wanted
to fist bump in the morning.

559
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:13,089
- And you didn't like that?
- I hated it. What are... what...

560
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:15,358
- I feel like you're forgiving me.
- No.

561
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:17,794
- I felt like before I said that
you were though. - Nope. Nope.

562
00:20:17,862 --> 00:20:20,095
Now you remembered you're
still mad at me. No? Okay.

563
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:21,997
- All right, good night, Nick. Night.
- Okay, good night, Jess.

564
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,431
Hey, Jess.

565
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:25,667
Too soon?

566
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:27,536
Yeah, too soon!

567
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:30,005
Well, hey, good night.
And I'm sorry about everything.

568
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:31,172
Okay.

569
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,147
Okay, yeah.
(Chuckles)

570
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:41,616
- That was...
- Yeah. That was...

571
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:42,804
- a little bit weird.
- So weird.

572
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:44,018
Let's not ever do that again.

573
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:45,853
- Yeah.
- Do it again. Okay.

574
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,722
- Good night. Night, Miller!
- Good night.

575
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:49,456
Good night, Sergeant.

576
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:54,528
I'm glad everything's
back to normal around here.

577
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:00,098
Thank you for
what you said up there.

578
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,967
- You know, I got a lot
of phone numbers. - Good.

579
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:04,169
I think I'm gonna go
on a lot of dates.

580
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:06,071
- I think that's a great thing.
Good.   - Yeah.

581
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:09,997
The plan hasn't changed;
I am still marrying an Indian guy.

582
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:10,996
- No, yeah, that's fine.
- Okay?

583
00:21:10,997 --> 00:21:13,412
But you went home with a Jew in
a turban, so I'm just saying.

584
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,959
Just take this off.
Come on. Let's go.

585
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,380
(Sighs)

586
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:18,983
God, I have missed this.

587
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:20,051
(Moaning)

588
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,887
Turban on? Turban off?

589
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:24,923
I'm gonna hate myself
for saying this, but...

590
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,658
turban on.

591
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:28,092
- Turban on it is.
- Uh-uh

592
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,427
Taking that
magic carpet ride.

593
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:36,228
- Yeah? No?
- Shut up! Whoo!

594
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:40,097
