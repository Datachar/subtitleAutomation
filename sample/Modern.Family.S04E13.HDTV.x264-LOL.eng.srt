1
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:07,760
As great as it is bringing a baby
home from the hospital,

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,526
there's one sound you absolutely
dread waking up to...

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,481
Relatives.

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,100
I really never saw
this wedding pictures, mama.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,500
How handsome and
young papa looks.

6
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,862
Ay, it makes me sad.

7
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:29,656
Ay, I know that you miss him.

8
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:31,393
No. Look at my ass.

9
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:33,597
There are two things in that picture
I don't have anymore.

10
00:00:35,142 --> 00:00:36,583
Sonia, can I help you?

11
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:38,710
No, no, she's fine.
It keeps her busy.

12
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:40,851
We need more corn.
Gloria, where is your garden?

13
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:41,909
I will harvest some.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,321
They don't live that way, honey.

15
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:45,362
Gloria, give me the keys.
We'll go to the market.

16
00:00:45,363 --> 00:00:47,177
Hey, you're all awake.
I didn't hear you.

17
00:00:47,178 --> 00:00:49,541
Oh, look at my two handsome men.

18
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:50,941
Mi niño, Fulgencio Umberto.

19
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:53,614
You know, about the name,
we're not entirely sure...

20
00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:56,914
Sonia, vámonos.
Good-bye, Fulgencio.

21
00:00:57,094 --> 00:00:58,886
Say good-bye to Fulgencio.

22
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:00,488
Good-bye, Fulgencio.

23
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:01,720
His name is Joe.

24
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:03,885
You tell her that
we're not naming him

25
00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:06,834
after her dead husband
or his father before him.

26
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:08,678
- His name was--
- Please don't say it again.

27
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:11,895
Jay, I cannot go against
my mother's will.

28
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:13,522
But she likes you.

29
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:15,329
Maybe if you convince her...

30
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,933
Fulgencio Umberto--
the initials are F.U. Pritchett.

31
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:21,278
Which is exactly
the way it feels right now.

32
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:33,815
Synced by YYeTs, corrected by gloriabg
www.addic7ed.com

33
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:36,480
Is there some kind of
dress code for godparents?

34
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:37,763
You're not wearing a fedora, Phil.

35
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,899
Can you pick up the dry cleaning?

36
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,670
That sounds like
an offer I can't refuse.

37
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,525
Yeah, we're not doing that.

38
00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:45,848
So I got delayed picking up
Lily from dance class.

39
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:47,099
Now Gloria's got me
running around

40
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,615
doing a thousand things
for christening.

41
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:50,011
Son of a bitch.

42
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:52,500
It's not that bad, really.
I'm just--I'm venting.

43
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,097
I couldn't believe it.
Somebody's balloons

44
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:55,948
were blocking my billboard. 
Philboard.

45
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,252
My philboard.

46
00:01:58,445 --> 00:02:00,500
Can we wear the same
outfits at Crispin's party

47
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,034
that we're wearing to the baptism?

48
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:03,129
Oh, you know what?
I don't know.

49
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,739
Because you wanna be
subdued at church

50
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,090
and then fabulous at night.

51
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:07,087
You know who
would make a fortune?

52
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:09,751
The designer who comes up with
the little black dress for men.

53
00:02:10,284 --> 00:02:11,406
I'm bored.

54
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:13,122
I know, sweetie,
but daddies are talking

55
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:14,769
about what we're
gonna wear tonight,

56
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,406
and that's a difficult conversation.

57
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:18,615
- Cry me a river.
- Lily.

58
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:20,724
I-I'm not loving this attitude.

59
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:21,785
You seem a little mean.

60
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:25,156
Sorry. Should I call you
a wah-mbulance?

61
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,692
Oh, my gosh.
She has been so snarky lately.

62
00:02:28,693 --> 00:02:30,249
I know. I've actually
been getting nervous

63
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,675
when we're making
her late for something.

64
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:33,005
Because of what
she said the other day?

65
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,006
- "Today, ladies."
- Hurtful.

66
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:37,447
You know, she hears us doing it,

67
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,394
so we--we should try
and be less negative.

68
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,214
Model some better behavior.

69
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:44,573
Yeah. Well, you know,
if it's a model she needs,

70
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:45,610
she's come to the right place.

71
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:46,630
Oh, boy.
Hmm.

72
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:49,451
I wish Lily was in here

73
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:51,629
so she could hear me
not comment on that.

74
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:53,339
I get it. You're modeling.

75
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:56,241
Hey, it's Phil Dunphy again.

76
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:58,503
I-I got cut off by your machine.

77
00:02:58,504 --> 00:03:00,384
I'm, uh, not sure
where I left off there,

78
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:01,514
but I'll attempt to be brief,

79
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,371
as I do appreciate when people
do the same for me.

80
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:08,184
Anyhoo, uh, your balloons
are co-- Damn it!

81
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:10,111
Is anyone home? Mom!

82
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:11,515
I need her first. Mom!

83
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:13,837
- She's out. - Why is she always 
gone when we need an adult?

84
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:15,656
- I can help.
- What's with the cage?

85
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:17,560
- Science project.
- Mom, where are you?

86
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,392
- Out. It's just the three of us.
- Four.

87
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:21,031
- I need her.
- Rats.

88
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,055
I know, right?

89
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:24,093
Guys, I'm right here.
What do you need?

90
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:24,608
- No, it's okay.
- We're good.

91
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:26,725
- Okay, never mind.
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

92
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:28,611
Family meeting.
Everybody grab some 'za.

93
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:30,076
We're gonna talk about this.

94
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,401
Listen, I know you guys
like to go to mom

95
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:36,553
because she's
Mr. tough guy problem-solver.

96
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:37,488
She gets results.

97
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,784
Yeah, she does.
She does. You're right.

98
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,261
Like the last time we got pizza
from our favorite place here.

99
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:43,902
Remember that?
We got shortchanged,

100
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:46,232
she cursed a blue streak
and got our money back?

101
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:48,148
How's that pizza, by the way?

102
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:49,952
- Pretty good. - It's okay.
- Liars!

103
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,314
It's garbage.

104
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,773
That's not Scardino's,
it's Scandoni's.

105
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:55,025
You know why?

106
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,734
'Cause your mom's little blow-up

107
00:03:56,735 --> 00:04:00,799
got us banned
from Scardino's for life.

108
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,396
So maybe your mom's way
isn't always the best way.

109
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:05,463
Now why don't you guys
tell me what's going on?

110
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:08,257
I'm having a '60s-themed
birthday party next week.

111
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:10,258
Hippies, bell-bottoms, tie-dye.

112
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,688
Karen Sullivan heard about it,

113
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:14,633
and decided to have
the same party... tonight.

114
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:16,232
Not groovy.

115
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,424
I accidentally called
my teacher "mommy."

116
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,312
My "friend" Reuben went around
and told everyone.

117
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:22,855
Oh, hey, Reuben,

118
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:24,931
do you remember that
class field trip to the zoo

119
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,652
when the zebra rushed the fence
and you peed your pants?

120
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:30,426
I didn't tell anyone,
not even on the bus ride home

121
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:31,828
when he had to sit next to mom--

122
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:33,744
Ms. Bockman! Damn it!

123
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:34,903
Our neighbor's out of town,

124
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:37,627
and she's paying me to move
her car on street cleaning days.

125
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:39,293
Now I would just park it
in her driveway,

126
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:41,714
but she already has a camper
and a cord of wood there.

127
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,540
Pretty sure she's a lesbian.

128
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,346
Anyway, easy money, right?

129
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,473
Oh, my God, I can't see anything!

130
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:48,735
Hard starboard!

131
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:50,204
What does that even mean?!

132
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:52,684
- Move your car! 
- How much longer do I have to block people?

133
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:54,302
- Come on!
- I'm late for the airport.

134
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:55,975
Dylan, you are being
no help right now!

135
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:58,467
Sorry, but I'm already
in trouble with dispatch

136
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:00,371
for drinking
all those little waters.

137
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:02,219
- Drive! Do it now!
- Aah!

138
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:06,244
How do I tell her
I snapped a branch

139
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:07,798
on her beloved lemon tree?

140
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,073
I mean, she boils the leaves

141
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:11,570
to add a scent to her
own work boot oil.

142
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:14,089
Did I mention she plays
in two softball leagues?

143
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,915
Now what are you guys gonna do?

144
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,154
You gonna have
your mom go around

145
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:19,708
and yell at all these people
and burn a bunch of bridges?

146
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,183
Or are you gonna talk
to your Reubens,

147
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:25,505
your Karens, your lemon... lady,

148
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:27,252
tell 'em how you feel,

149
00:05:27,253 --> 00:05:29,125
appeal to their human side?

150
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:32,402
The choice is pretty simple, huh?

151
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:36,241
So she's out all day?

152
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:37,842
- I'll try her cell.
- It's off.

153
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:39,700
I texted her while dad was talking.

154
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,687
Pilar, I brought you a coffee.

155
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:46,111
- Oh.
- I put a little something extra in it.

156
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,042
Jay, you devil.

157
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,160
Hey, by the way, look...

158
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,225
It's beautiful, no?

159
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:56,933
It's the dressing gown
for Fulgencio's christening.

160
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:58,973
All the men in
our family wear this.

161
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:00,529
What's one more son in a dress?

162
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,714
Oh, tradition.
Oh, it's so important.

163
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:07,654
I have a gift in here
for little Fulgencio

164
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:10,241
that has been in my family
for three generations.

165
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:12,003
You know, about
this naming thing--

166
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,654
In America, it's not real common
to hear the name Fuljencio.

167
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:17,177
It's "Ful-hen-cio."

168
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:18,523
- Hen?
- Hen.

169
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:21,349
I don't need to practice it
'cause I can't name my son that.

170
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:23,171
I'm just being honest with you.

171
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:25,512
No. No, no, no, no, that's good.

172
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:27,467
That's good. I should be
more honest with you sometimes.

173
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:29,111
Well, we've known
each other a few years.

174
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:30,458
- I don't like you, Jay.
- Huh?

175
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:33,574
Nah. We can act like
everything is fine for the family,

176
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:35,414
but, you know,
I have never liked you.

177
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:38,677
The way you take whatever
looks good to you--

178
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:42,518
you know, like my daughter
or the last piece of meat.

179
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:45,513
You're always too busy
to pick me up at the airport.

180
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:48,556
You send a total stranger
with a cardboard sign.

181
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:49,827
- Hi, grandma.
- Hey.

182
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:51,419
Hey, buddy.
Get over here.

183
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:53,803
I sure do love
the cross you got me.

184
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,191
But do I have to wear it today?

185
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,167
It's kinda hard to close
my shirt over it.

186
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:58,691
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

187
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:00,584
You do whatever you want, padrecito.

188
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,433
I know that's
the way in this house.

189
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:05,731
But if you wear it, ooh,
you'll make me proud.

190
00:07:05,732 --> 00:07:08,021
It's been in my family 
for five generations.

191
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:09,894
- Okay.
- I'll walk you out, buddy.

192
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:12,329
Is anything in her family new?

193
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:15,275
Just you.

194
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:26,060
Okay. Excuse me. Sorry.

195
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:29,346
All right.
Here we've got the deli platter,

196
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:31,018
and there's more in my car.

197
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:33,022
But those are not
from Rumpernook's.

198
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:34,963
No, because the cheese at Rump...

199
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,519
I don't go there anymore.

200
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,187
I'm going to do the laundry.

201
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:41,033
Okay, Sonia.
I love you so much.

202
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:43,030
Wow. Pretty cozy with
the new housekeeper, huh?

203
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:44,620
She's my sister.

204
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,167
Wow. Pretty weird
with your sister.

205
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:50,210
She likes to keep busy.
But I feel bad for her.

206
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:52,159
I have so much,
and she has nothing.

207
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,174
Okay. Well, people
make their own choices.

208
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:55,372
It's not like you're responsible.

209
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:56,589
No, no.

210
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,042
Maybe just a little bit.

211
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:02,625
I was older and I had
opportunities to travel,

212
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:03,769
and I took them.

213
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,922
Well, it didn't prevent her
from going anywhere.

214
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:07,035
No, no.

215
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:09,083
Maybe just one time.

216
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:11,390
There was a letter
that arrived from America

217
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,362
about a job opportunity.

218
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:15,410
And it was only for one person,

219
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:16,622
and I went.

220
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:19,639
But it's not like the envelope
was addressed to her,

221
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,525
and you opened it and...

222
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:22,402
You're evil.

223
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:24,795
I had to get out of there, Claire.

224
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:26,489
You just strapped
on those high heels

225
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,734
and walked right over
her back, didn't you?

226
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,743
Maybe a little bit.

227
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,511
Where is the river?

228
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:36,696
Hey, boys!

229
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:37,717
Crispin.

230
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,088
Hey, shouldn't you be preparing

231
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,661
for your annual party
of the century?

232
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:41,595
It's done and it's perfect.

233
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:43,084
In my mind,
I'm already into next year's.

234
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:44,309
Listen, I'm here with Brett.

235
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,508
I don't know if you've seen
his new look,

236
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,346
but you are going to have
a heart attack and die.

237
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:48,008
No one's dying.

238
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:49,692
- It's just an expression.
- Yeah.

239
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,700
Hey, handsome.

240
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:52,926
Yep, I did it.

241
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:54,537
Pulled the trigger and got a perm.

242
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:55,829
You sure did.

243
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,867
Did it myself,
right in the kitchen.

244
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:59,353
You don't need
to spend a million

245
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:00,809
to look like a million.

246
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:03,080
Uh, you know,
my coffee's probably ready, so...

247
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:06,023
Bye.

248
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,265
Okay, that's like a chia pet, right?

249
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:10,140
Maybe a drag production of "Annie"?

250
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:11,477
Oh, actually, Lily,

251
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:13,149
I-I think Uncle Crispin's forgetting

252
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,603
that Brett has feelings,

253
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:16,084
and we need to try
and not hurt them.

254
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:17,828
Yes, and maybe we should
remind Uncle Crispin

255
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:19,556
that when you say
nice things to people,

256
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:21,326
they say nice things back.

257
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:23,970
Well... consider me reminded.

258
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:25,489
Gotta run.

259
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,696
Yeah, we'll see you tonight. Bye.

260
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:27,740
Okay. Yeah, can't wait.
Can't wait.

261
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:28,737
He's funny.

262
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:30,860
Yes, he is,
but he can also be biting.

263
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,187
- He bites people?
- Well, with his words,

264
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:34,922
not with his teeth
like Xander from art class.

265
00:09:34,923 --> 00:09:36,360
We need to confirm
he got his shot.

266
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:37,170
Yeah.

267
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:39,781
Oh, my God. Okay, Crispin--

268
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:42,493
"Too many RSVPs.
Have to make cuts to party.

269
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,422
Maybe next time."
Sad face.

270
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,460
Because we refuse to abuse,

271
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,759
we get banned from
the party of the century?

272
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:52,686
Does somebody need
a wah-mbulance?

273
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,070
No.
I do not need a wah-mbulance.

274
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,930
Hey, kids. How was your day?

275
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,018
I knew the answer to that question.

276
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:03,481
I'd had kind of a busy day

277
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:06,028
going around solving
everyone's problems.

278
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:09,195
I started by going to see
my buddy Stavros the florist.

279
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,551
Stavros, I assume?

280
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:12,181
Yes?

281
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:14,316
I just wanted to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

282
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:14,826
Oh, thank you.

283
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:17,248
Yeah, I brought you
some sandwiches, by the way.

284
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,890
How good is lamb, huh?

285
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:21,620
- Nikos!
- Oh! Gotcha.

286
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,234
Get back in there.

287
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:25,667
I'm so sorry.

288
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:27,684
Is there anything
I can do for you?

289
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:29,967
Oh, no. No. I...

290
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:32,319
Well...

291
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,685
That's when I realized
my kids didn't understand

292
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:36,325
the concept of killing
with kindness

293
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:38,179
because they'd never seen it.

294
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,796
So I decided I'd prove it to them

295
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:43,683
by going on a huggacidal rampage.

296
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,899
Is that Reuben rockin'
the Potter specs?

297
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,684
Quiddiculous!

298
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,917
Hey, listen, buddy,

299
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:51,787
I heard about Luke
calling his teacher "mommy."

300
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:53,428
Epic fail, by the way.

301
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:55,245
But, you know, since
you're one of the cool kids,

302
00:10:55,246 --> 00:10:58,062
maybe you could ge
the other ones to ease off a little?

303
00:10:58,546 --> 00:11:00,378
Cool. Air bump.

304
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:02,653
Hey, Lee, it's Phil Dunphy
from down the street.

305
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:04,013
We haven't met.
I was actually calling

306
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:05,312
to leave a message for your wife,

307
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:07,999
just to say thanks
for hiring my daughter Haley.

308
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,182
Listen, we'd love to have you and
the missus over for a glass of wine,

309
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:13,249
or--or, uh, maybe you and I
could go out for a boys' night.

310
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,612
But anyway, if you could--

311
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:15,771
Damn it!

312
00:11:17,204 --> 00:11:19,715
Hey, Karen Sullivan.
Alex's dad.

313
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:22,148
Well, look whose teeth
got so nice and straight.

314
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:25,689
Who wants to go first?

315
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:26,796
- Are you kidding?
- Are you crazy?

316
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:28,770
- What are you trying to--
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

317
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,008
One at a time!

318
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:31,869
You called Ms. Cooper a man!

319
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,683
No, I didn't.

320
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:35,193
- I got her husband Lee on the machine.
- There is no husband!

321
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,203
She's Lee!

322
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:38,571
Weirdly deep-voiced,
alcoholic, gay Lee Cooper

323
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,921
who you invited out
for a glass of wine!

324
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:42,855
Thanks to your little
charm offensive with Karen,

325
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:44,327
one thing did change
about her party--

326
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,415
I'm not invited!

327
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,323
"Quiddiculous"? "Epic fail"?

328
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:49,924
Now the whole school
is just laughing at both of us.

329
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:55,116
Stavros, hey!

330
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,097
Why not?!

331
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:02,545
What?

332
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:04,018
Change of plans.

333
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,436
This isn't over.

334
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:08,561
I want you to wear
something beautiful tonight.

335
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,322
So please, choose.

336
00:12:10,745 --> 00:12:12,016
What is this room?

337
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,886
This is the closet.

338
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:15,767
So all the people of the town,

339
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,576
they leave their
nice clothes with you?

340
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,044
No. These are all my clothes.

341
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:24,278
But... I do miss
the simple things at home.

342
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:27,572
So tell me, how--
how are things in the village?

343
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:28,715
We had a flood.

344
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:31,645
Ay, but it--
it wasn't a bad one, right?

345
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:32,775
We had a boat.

346
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:34,376
Ay, that's great.

347
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:36,066
We had a boat.

348
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:38,847
Are you dating anyone?

349
00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:41,152
You remember Antonio Marquez?

350
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:42,232
Yes, of course.

351
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,297
The most handsome boy
in the school

352
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,362
with those beautiful eyes.

353
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,448
His father with the wooden leg...

354
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:50,244
He lost it in the flood.

355
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,122
So is it serious?

356
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:57,582
Don't look at that.

357
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,893
I won't. Trust me.

358
00:12:58,894 --> 00:12:59,895
Please. It's pathetic.

359
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,249
Crispin getting all of our friends

360
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,559
to text us the details
of his great party.

361
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,253
Such torture, huh?

362
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,998
Oh, catering by Amelia's.
Ow!

363
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:09,847
Topless valet Parkers.

364
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:11,267
- Sting.
- Exactly.

365
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:14,217
No, Sting is at the party.
Mitchell, I wanna be there.

366
00:13:14,218 --> 00:13:15,412
- Cam.
- No, come on.

367
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,802
Who are we kidding?
You do, too.

368
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:18,193
Today, ladies!

369
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:19,280
Okay, right there. That.

370
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:20,900
That is why we are
making the sacrifice--

371
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:21,692
for our daughter.

372
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:22,571
Oh, yeah, you're right.

373
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:24,744
I mean, I'm the last one
who should be complaining

374
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:27,597
when, let's face it,
Lily's snarkiness is my doing.

375
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,252
Well, what's done is done.

376
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:30,981
Let's just get ready for church.

377
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:33,216
Yeah, I mean, it's just
hard to not feel guilty,

378
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:34,987
you know, when
it's mostly my fault.

379
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:37,191
I get it.
Just don't beat yourself up.

380
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,365
Hey. Pocket square?
No pocket square?

381
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:42,463
Really? You're taking zero
of the responsibility, or...

382
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:45,163
Oh. We're you trying
to get me to take the blame?

383
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,671
Maybe just a little. Uh-huh.

384
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:49,061
Oh, and deny you the chance
to play the martyr?

385
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:51,286
Look, Cam, if you're looking
for me to be the bad guy,

386
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,414
you're snarking up
the wrong tree, okay?

387
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:56,319
You are the one who can't let
a single situation pass

388
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,897
without making a comment.

389
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:02,341
Oh, well, maybe I'll just start today.

390
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,768
I think it'll make you feel better.

391
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:05,256
I think I already do.

392
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:07,270
Right to my face,
"I don't like you."

393
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:08,633
Nobody doesn't like me.

394
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:11,017
I'm Jay. I'm--
I'm salt of the earth.

395
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:12,905
Why are you inhaling my baby?

396
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:15,177
Oh, they only smell perfect
like this for a little while.

397
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:16,870
Yeah. That's the stuff.

398
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:19,272
From day one, I've treated
this woman like a queen.

399
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:20,857
I've flown her back and forth,

400
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:23,022
I've... I've tasted her native food.

401
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:24,436
You know what chin tastes like?

402
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:25,692
- Mm.
- 'Cause I do.

403
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:27,251
And now to find out...

404
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:29,567
What? I'm listening.

405
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,130
You're rubbing yourself
with the baby.

406
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:33,058
I have seen you
French kiss your dog.

407
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:34,942
She was taking a treat
out of my mouth.

408
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:35,797
That's a trick.

409
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:37,034
I am sure you know

410
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:38,860
what I find funny
about this situation.

411
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:39,727
What?

412
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:42,373
You have an in-law who,
no matter what you do,

413
00:14:42,374 --> 00:14:45,152
no matter how hard you try,
you can't win over.

414
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:46,232
What about it?

415
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,273
Wait. That doesn't sound familiar?

416
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,348
You're not saying...

417
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:52,852
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I am.

418
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:55,729
Son of a bitch, I'm Phil.

419
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:03,523
Hey, Pilar, it's awfully cold.

420
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:05,104
Here. Why don't you take my jacket?

421
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,805
Sure, yeah.
Make me the rude one.

422
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,547
Look, I'm sorry
that I pointed out

423
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:10,473
that we're both
to blame here, all right?

424
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,297
But let's not turn
this lovely event

425
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:14,588
into a competition.
Here you go, sweetie.

426
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:16,629
Oh, you know what? You're right.
I shouldn't be picking at you.

427
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,129
But don't forget to light your candle.

428
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,696
I think everyone in the immediate
family's doing it.

429
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:21,368
Oh, yeah? Okay.
Good--good idea.

430
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:25,651
What the hell is that?

431
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:28,357
Some kind of gay protest thing?

432
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:30,218
It's a candle, dad.
What are you talking about?

433
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:31,829
You' purple panty tail.

434
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,347
Oh, no. Oh, come on.

435
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:35,964
We're in church, Mitchell,
not some disco.

436
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,795
You did that on purpose!

437
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:40,558
Oh, this stained glass is beautiful.

438
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,894
Now listen, before
we dunk the kid,

439
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:43,877
you mind if I make
a few casual remarks?

440
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:45,438
I think you already did.

441
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,069
Claire asked me a good question--

442
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,396
how did Phil win me over?

443
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:51,015
Well, he hasn't yet.

444
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,463
But when he stops trying so hard,

445
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:55,954
and he acts like a real person,
he comes close.

446
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,204
That's what I needed
to do with Pilar.

447
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:00,131
I'd like to tell you the story

448
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:02,171
of how I came to meet
my incredible wife,

449
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:04,080
because up until
the birth of this child,

450
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:06,122
it's the best thing that
ever happened to me.

451
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,262
Mm, that feels good huh?

452
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:09,471
So it's morning.
My car's getting waxed.

453
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:10,863
I hop in the diner.

454
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:12,213
I hear this adorable accent.

455
00:16:12,214 --> 00:16:14,836
I turn. I see this pretty girl
talking to her friend.

456
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:16,471
I send over a piece of pie.

457
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:17,804
- All class.
- Mm-hmm.

458
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:18,939
Couple of minutes later,

459
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,300
who comes over
to thank me but Gloria,

460
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:24,401
the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

461
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:25,226
Amen.

462
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:27,203
She sits down, we start talking,

463
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,882
and we haven't stopped talking since.

464
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:31,587
But here's the crazy part--

465
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,323
I didn't send the pie to Gloria.

466
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:35,042
Her back was to me.

467
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:36,397
I sent it to her friend,

468
00:16:36,398 --> 00:16:38,150
who went to the bathroom
and missed it.

469
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:40,337
And that person is here today--

470
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:42,202
Gloria's sister Sonia.

471
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:44,823
Isn't it funny how
a simple twist of fate

472
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:45,994
can change the whole--

473
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:47,357
You stole my life!

474
00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:50,205
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

475
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:51,177
I got Sonia!

476
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,569
No more. I want
my own life, my own bed,

477
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,174
my own e-mail account!

478
00:16:58,175 --> 00:17:00,248
Yeah, leave your
poor old mother alone.

479
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:02,248
Don't worry mamá,
you can come and live with us.

480
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:03,983
Whoa. Pump the brakes here.

481
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:05,605
What? Do you have
a problem with my mother?

482
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:07,141
No. Your mother
has a problem with me.

483
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,666
You think she's helpless.
Ask her what's in that box.

484
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,044
It's not the family gun?

485
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:13,661
Jay, if anything
should happen to Gloria,

486
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,016
I am there for you.

487
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:17,034
What, Sonia?
What's going to happen to me?

488
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,162
You might go for a walk
in your closet one day

489
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,805
and never come back!

490
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:24,812
See what you're missing?
Huh?

491
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:29,194
Where is Luke?

492
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:31,053
I think he's the one
standing next to Matthew.

493
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:32,246
Phil.

494
00:17:32,444 --> 00:17:33,801
He was feeling a little
under the weather.

495
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,697
I let him stay home.

496
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:36,576
Or is he just too embarrassed
to leave the house?

497
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,036
Why would he be embarrassed?

498
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:39,778
Because dad tried
to fix all our problems,

499
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:41,617
and instead, ruined all our lives.

500
00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:42,809
Nightmare.

501
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:44,737
You girls are so dramatic.

502
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:47,161
Do I need to call you
a wah-mbulance?

503
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:49,666
Wah-wah, wah-wah.

504
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:52,935
- Did you hear that?
- Yes!

505
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:54,787
Claire's been driving Lily
to dance class all week.

506
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:55,847
That's where she gets it from!

507
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:58,032
- We're not bad parents. Claire is.
- Huh.

508
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:00,077
I said I wasn't gonna cry,

509
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,767
but, oh, boy, here it comes.
Hmm!

510
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:05,442
- No, no, Cam. Not with those.
- Huh?

511
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:08,966
Okay! That's it!

512
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:11,248
We're in a House of God, damn it.

513
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:14,464
Fine. Everyone just abandon me.

514
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:15,967
Pilar, all due respect,

515
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:17,439
no one's buying the martyr act.

516
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,761
Not even this guy.

517
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:20,972
You ask me, you've been keeping
this one under your thumb

518
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:22,879
'cause you're afraid
of going on with your life.

519
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,676
But you're an attractive woman
with a lot to offer.

520
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:27,102
This could be an opportunity.

521
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,916
Hell, I don't even think
I knew what happiness was

522
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:29,894
till I was 60.

523
00:18:29,895 --> 00:18:31,218
And the hits just keep coming.
Okay.

524
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:33,307
Sonia, we're gonna help you
get your own place,

525
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:34,881
have some independence.

526
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:36,139
And if you ever get lonely,

527
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,260
you come visit us
as much as you want...

528
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:39,950
With-- within reason.

529
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,522
- And we'll send this one
down to visit you. - What?

530
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:45,221
But he's not gonna become
a priest 'cause he likes girls.

531
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:47,216
Can't get 'em, but he likes 'em.

532
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:49,944
So... everybody think about it.

533
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:50,804
But not for too long.

534
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:52,693
There's an A.A. meeting
here at 6:00.

535
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:56,100
Sonia, please,
let us do this for you.

536
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:58,110
I really want you to be happy.

537
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,038
Can you forgive me?

538
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:01,622
It will take some time.

539
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,047
As much as you need.

540
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,335
And some dresses.

541
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:05,575
As many as you want.

542
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:06,897
And some shoes.

543
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,777
You're angry now.

544
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,831
Whatever happened with the kids,

545
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:13,768
I don't want you
to feel bad about it.

546
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:15,049
I don't.

547
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,882
I now invite the godfather
and the godmother to join us.

548
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:21,059
Don't worry.

549
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,808
I will take care
of everything tomorrow.

550
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:25,081
That may not be necessary,
my wife.

551
00:19:26,614 --> 00:19:29,123
Phil and Claire, as godparents,

552
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,230
are you ready to help

553
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:32,811
the parents of this child
in their duties?

554
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:34,052
- We are.
- We are.

555
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,326
Do you renounce Satan?

556
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:42,982
- I do renounce him.
- I do renounce him.

557
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:49,650
And all his works?

558
00:19:54,488 --> 00:19:56,448
I do renounce them.

559
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:02,392
Hey! Hey!

560
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:09,215
And all his empty promises?

561
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:16,065
Oh, my God!

562
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:19,002
I do renounce them.

563
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,510
Godfather, is it your wish
that this child be baptized?

564
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,623
It is.

565
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:45,474
In the name of the father
and the son and the holy spirit,

566
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,035
what name have you given the child?

567
00:20:48,051 --> 00:20:50,770
Fulgencio Joseph Pritchett.

568
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:53,841
May God be with you all.

569
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:55,591
Thank you, Jay.

570
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:57,136
We're never gonna call him that.

571
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:10,343
So I heard that somebody
released a bunch of rats

572
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:12,415
into Karen Sullivan's party
the other night.

573
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:16,865
And Lee Cooper's camper
just rolled into her lemon tree.

574
00:21:17,117 --> 00:21:18,694
Luke isn't having any problem
at school anymore,

575
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,270
because Reuben admitted
he made the whole thing up.

576
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:22,480
Isn't that crazy,

577
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,881
how all our of kids' problems
just disappeared?

578
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:27,819
Don't ever ask me
about my business, Claire.

579
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:30,102
What are you talking about?

580
00:21:30,198 --> 00:21:31,882
Don't ask me about my business.

581
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:32,882
I wasn't.

582
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:34,283
Good.

583
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:36,031
Don't.

584
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:44,831
