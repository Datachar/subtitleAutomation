Well, that's the reason
that I'm so good at making it.

704
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,384
Celebrating a little early,
don't you think?

705
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,840
No, the glass is coming along well.

706
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:58,543
We'll have the first of 55
ready in an hour.

707
00:30:58,627 --> 00:31:00,195
Once we've perfected
the mold --

708
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:02,100
Uh, I actually don't give a crap.

709
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,166
How long will the rest take?
A day. Maybe two.

710
00:31:05,217 --> 00:31:06,574
One day it is.

711
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:12,640
Well...

712
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:14,692
Well...chop-chop.

713
00:31:14,777 --> 00:31:16,277
Thanks for the taste.

714
00:31:18,557 --> 00:31:21,462
You broke into his office.
The door was unlocked.

715
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:23,194
Don't play semantics.

716
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,030
James was telling the truth.

717
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:25,864
What'd you find?

718
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,123
Flynn has a gun in his whiskey case.

719
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:28,506
It's a Browning P9R,

720
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:30,099
the same model used to kill Ellen.

721
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:33,079
Flynn Sr. was arrogant enough
to hold onto a murder weapon.

722
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,733
You really think
his son would do the same?

723
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:36,253
He wants to be just like his father.

724
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:38,044
He's obsessed with the family's history,

725
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:40,212
getting things back to how they were.

726
00:31:40,297 --> 00:31:42,214
The same model doesn't mean
the same gun.

727
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:45,066
It means my father
was telling the truth.

728
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:48,971
Don't go off book again.

729
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:52,440
If we stay the course
and arrest him on distribution,

730
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,110
our warrant will allow us

731
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:55,861
to seize everything in the warehouse.

732
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:57,513
Including the gun?
Yes.

733
00:31:57,564 --> 00:31:58,948
Okay, but how?
Flynn's playing it safe with me.

734
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,233
But he'll talk to the Conroys.

735
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:03,703
The family that used to run
their whiskey distribution?

736
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:06,205
But according to the files,
they haven't spoken in years.

737
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:07,144
Exactly.

738
00:32:07,264 --> 00:32:09,020
Bringing the families
back together again

739
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,823
fits right into his sweet spot.

740
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:13,129
Does organized crime have someone
undercover with the Conroys?

741
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:14,413
They do.

742
00:32:14,498 --> 00:32:16,665
He agreed to contact Flynn,
set up a meet,

743
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:18,467
and vouch for one of our agents.

744
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:20,669
Who are you sending?
No.

745
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:22,805
Peter, you can't.
It's too dangerous.

746
00:32:22,872 --> 00:32:24,223
Says the man who broke
into Flynn's office

747
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:26,058
and stole a drink.

748
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:28,677
This is our best shot
at getting them on record.

749
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:30,813
And it allows you to be there
to keep an eye on me.

750
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,148
Hmm, guess you're right.

751
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:34,183
Your cover better be airtight.

752
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:35,684
Which means I need to talk to an expert

753
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:37,236
on the Conroys and Flynns.

754
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,271
[ Sighs ]

755
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:45,244
But they didn't check his boot.

756
00:32:45,328 --> 00:32:47,029
Conroy Sr. had a Snubnose
tucked in there.

757
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,365
Problem was, when he went to grab it,

758
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,167
he couldn't pull the damn thing out.
[ Laughs ]

759
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:53,402
That's when the Flynns
cut off ties with him.

760
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:55,571
Conroys were lucky
that's all they cut off.

761
00:32:55,622 --> 00:32:57,039
This is all very helpful.

762
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,407
I know.

763
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:01,093
All right, I'm gonna study up on this,

764
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:04,413
and, uh, I'll see you later.
Mm-hmm.

765
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:05,714
I should get going, too.

766
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:06,799
Uh, hang on a second.

767
00:33:08,084 --> 00:33:09,552
Can you stick around?

768
00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:10,770
Sure.

769
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:17,059
Have a seat.

770
00:33:19,446 --> 00:33:21,614
I saw the whiskey container.

771
00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:23,649
There is
a gun in there --

772
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:25,434
the same kind used to kill Ellen.

773
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:26,935
We get the gun, we get Flynn.

774
00:33:26,987 --> 00:33:28,770
I should have taken it.

775
00:33:28,822 --> 00:33:30,122
No, no, no.
You did the right thing.

776
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:32,608
Peter has a good plan.
You should stick to it.

777
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:34,220
Make sure they don't get away with this.

778
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:37,112
Do you believe me, Neal?

779
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:39,381
I want to.

780
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:41,250
But there's one thing
I don't understand.

781
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:42,968
Ellen said you told her
you were innocent,

782
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:44,553
and then you confessed.

783
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:46,788
Why would you confess
to a murder you didn't commit?

784
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,760
I've never told this to anyone,
not even Ellen.

785
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:54,630
A couple of days after I was
arrested, she came to see me.

786
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:56,265
She'd done some digging,

787
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:58,567
and she realized that I was framed.

788
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:00,802
She also realized that the Flynns

789
00:34:00,854 --> 00:34:03,239
<i>didn't</i> have the cops in their pocket.

790
00:34:03,306 --> 00:34:04,773
They were working <i>for</i> the cops,

791
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:07,159
some people very high up on the force.

792
00:34:07,244 --> 00:34:11,497
And for the first time, I had hope.

793
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:13,148
But then I got a phone call,

794
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,167
and the man on the other end of the line

795
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:18,504
wanted Ellen to
stop investigating immediately.

796
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:20,206
He threatened to kill
everybody I cared about --

797
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,325
Ellen, your mother, you.

798
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:26,128
The only way to protect everyone
was to confess

799
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:28,997
and turn state's evidence
against the Flynns.

800
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:31,800
The marshals immediately pulled you and
your mother into Witness Protection.

801
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:32,935
What about Ellen?

802
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:34,353
The same.

803
00:34:34,437 --> 00:34:35,504
They were worried

804
00:34:35,555 --> 00:34:37,940
the Flynns would try
and get to her, too.

805
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:40,609
I thought I'd join you
and your mom in WITSEC,

806
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:43,612
but, uh, she filed for divorce.

807
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,681
She wanted separate locations.

808
00:34:45,732 --> 00:34:50,286
I don't blame her.
She thought I was cop killer.

809
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:52,988
So you gave up everything
to keep us safe.

810
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,208
I gave up everything
the minute I took that cash.

811
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:59,295
Do you know who was on the phone?

812
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:00,546
I don't.

813
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,299
But you don't kill a cop
and get a phone call

814
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:05,384
unless it's somebody very powerful.

815
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:07,503
Police chief maybe.

816
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:09,805
Never could figure that part out.

817
00:35:09,872 --> 00:35:11,707
But Flynn would know.

818
00:35:11,758 --> 00:35:14,393
Look, if we find out,
you can stop running.

819
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:17,846
I can't even imagine
what that would be like.

820
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:23,051
I'll be meeting with Flynn
as mark Conroy.

821
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:24,737
He's the most camera-shy
of the family.

822
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:28,056
Few know what he looks like,
and he's about my age.

823
00:35:28,108 --> 00:35:30,225
Neal's at the warehouse now,
working on the bottles.

824
00:35:30,277 --> 00:35:31,944
I'm scheduled to arrive there
in an hour.

825
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,612
Once Peter uses the trigger phrase,

826
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:34,896
"We have a deal," we move in.

827
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:36,365
What's your response time?

828
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,736
We'll be two blocks down to
avoid any chance of being seen,

829
00:35:38,752 --> 00:35:41,170
so I'm guessing a minute,
90 seconds tops.

830
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:43,138
Great. Let's move out.

831
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:48,127
There's something about

832
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:51,246
the art of crafting a piece from within

833
00:35:51,298 --> 00:35:54,016
that's exquisitely challenging.

00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,135
Okay, Chihuly, good work.

You know how it is.
You can't be too careful.

839
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:10,432
You should tell them to go ahead
and check my boot.

And the glasswork?

We could make a lot of money on this.

Oh, I agree. They did great work.
Mm.

And, luckily, we won't be needing
them for too much longer.

What do you mean?

853
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,524
Well, we've recorded their process.

We can use the video
to train our own guys.

But why get rid of them?
Are they becoming a problem?

are they making for you?

bottle number 55 right now.

Nah, it's best
if you don't get too familiar.

not gonna keep them, you know?

I'm gonna check on Peter.

887
00:38:27,454 --> 00:38:31,039
Dennis Flynn Jr.,
you're under arrest

888
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:32,508
for intent to distribute
counterfeit items

889
00:38:32,575 --> 00:38:34,042
and attempted murder

890
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:37,679
and whatever crimes you may have
committed with this weapon.

891
00:38:37,747 --> 00:38:39,264
You planted that gun.

892
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:41,082
I've never seen it before in my life.

893
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:42,601
Bet your dad said the same thing.

894
00:38:51,972 --> 00:38:53,706
Hey.
Did forensics come back?

895
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:56,676
Ballistics matched Flynn's gun
to Ellen's murder weapon.

896
00:38:56,727 --> 00:38:58,011
So we got him.

897
00:38:58,062 --> 00:38:59,211
We did.

00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:01,648
What aren't you telling me?

899
00:39:02,636 --> 00:39:04,488
Somebody else got him, too.

900
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,056
Flynn was being escorted
to a transport car

901
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:12,492
when he was stabbed to death
by a prisoner with a shiv.

902
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,901
Someone wanted him dead awfully fast.

903
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:17,080
Very few people knew he was there.

904
00:39:17,164 --> 00:39:19,832
We need to find out who had access
to Flynn's release documents.

905
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,868
I'm on it.
It's not a long list.

906
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:27,407
But the bad news is, we lost
Flynn and whatever he knows.

907
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:29,287
Well, he must have been
working with someone,

908
00:39:29,363 --> 00:39:30,643
looking for Ellen's evidence box.

909
00:39:30,758 --> 00:39:32,578
Someone who knew that Flynn's
only angle in prison

910
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,982
would be to turn on them,
so Flynn had to die and fast.

911
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:36,916
Now, the good news is,

912
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,751
we forced someone to play their hand.

913
00:39:38,802 --> 00:39:41,054
And like Diana said,
it's not a long list.

914
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:43,773
But whoever it is
has an incredible reach.

915
00:39:43,857 --> 00:39:47,226
Neal, if they can get to Flynn
like this...

916
00:39:47,277 --> 00:39:48,561
James is right.

in that pendant

And hopefully to clearing my name.
