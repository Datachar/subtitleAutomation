1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,300
??????

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,800
Stone & Son Suit Warehouse 
recently lost their paper provider.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,000
They're a family-owned business.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,200
Jim and I
used to clean up at those.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,000
We'd go in pretending to be
family-- brothers.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,900
We did it
at a family-owned law firm,

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,200
at a family-owned
construction company,

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,700
and a family-owned
motorcycle store.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,800
Jim and Dwight Shrupert.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,700
I was the dynamic Likeable winner
that was doted upon by mom.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,300
Whoo!

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And Jim was the closeted
foot fetishist pretending to belong.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,600
The client
never knew any of that.

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,400
But I knew.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,000
I hope you've been paying
your wig storage bills, Jimbo,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,700
'cause it's time for another episode of
 "handsome and stinky,paper brothers for hire."

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,200
Sorry, stinky.
Can't do it-- too busy.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,100
Oh, God, this again?
You're stinky.

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,800
Okay. There's no possible way
I can get there,

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,300
so just ask Phyllis.
She can be your older sister or something.

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,300
Phyllis my sister?

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,600
More like my dead
great-great-grandmother who died of stupidity.

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,300
I have ears, Dwight.

24
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, do you really
have ears, Phyllis?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,700
Like all human beings?

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,400
We all have ears.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,000
See what you leave me with
here, Jim?

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, I'm in Philadelphia
right now.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,500
How is that my problem? 
Get in your car and drive down here.

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,200
You can make it in 30 minutes
if you drive 240 miles per hour.

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,900
Huh. How long would it take me
if I drove 300 miles an hour?

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,000
Mm. That's a good...

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,700
question.

34
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,400
300 times

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,000
180

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,700
Um... that comes
to 25 minutes.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,100
Yes.
Oh, well, thank you, Jim.

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes, I am better than you.
Thanks for acknowledging that.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,700
Okay, bye-bye.
Love you.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,100
Darryl, looking good!

44
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,300
Heading to Philly.
Interview with Jim's company.

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,700
Hey, good luck.

46
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,800
When you get to Philly,
will you tell Jim I miss him?

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,300
Why don't you come along
and tell him yourself?

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,700
Ha ha.
That'd be great.

49
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,000
Kinda like ditching school,

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,100
except instead of getting
suspended, you get...

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,100
what do you get?

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,700
Oh, my God!
Why didn't I think of this?

53
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,100
Andy's not here.

54
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,300
Oh, hey, Erin,

55
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,200
I'm expecting
a shipment of pens.

56
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
- Can you cover that?
- Mm-hmm. Cover that.

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
What does that mean, exactly?
What are we talking here?

58
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,900
Details.

59
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,800
A delivery guy
will deliver a box of pens,

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,700
and you just make sure
everything's in order.

61
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,600
what? Everything?

62
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,400
What-- how do I make sure
it's in order?

63
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,200
haven't been
trained for this.

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,400
Okay, see you later.

65
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,700
Hey, guys.

66
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,200
- Clark.
- Hey.

67
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,400
Hey, look who's back.
Dwight Junior.

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,100
Hey, so how was it?

69
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,000
I mean...
the sex with Jan.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,400
A gentleman doesn't
discuss such matters.

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,000
Especially when the feelings
of a lady are involved.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,900
Women reach their sexual peak
at whatever age Jan was last week.

73
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,800
I mean, it was... like making
love with a wild animal.

74
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,400
But not like a cougar
like you might think.

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,300
It was, uh...
like a swarm of bees.

76
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,300
Bees that just find
something wrong with every hotel room.

77
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,100
Nothing wrong
with being a gentleman.

78
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,400
Like my mom used to say,
"talk classy, act nasty."

79
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
What's with the wig, Meredith?

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,100
What, is it on backwards?

81
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,800
Nope.
You got it. You fixed it.

82
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Uh, I have a gift from Jan.

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
It's an espresso maker.

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,700
We came to be quite fond 
of espresso on the Amalfi Coast, so...

85
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,200
bon appetit.

86
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,700
Ooh!
16 types of espresso.

87
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,000
Now, that's Italian.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
My friend has one of these.

89
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Fool-proof espresso
every time.

90
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,100
Always with the friends, Oscar.

91
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,300
Can't we just enjoy
the new espresso machine?

92
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,800
Actually,
it's pronounced espresso.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,100
Wait.
That's what you said.

94
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,300
I apologize. I just assumed
you would mispronounce it.

95
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,300
So...

96
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,700
There he is!
Ha ha!

97
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,800
We are all so proud of you 
for the small part that you played

98
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,100
in landing the White Pages.

99
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,500
Prouder of me, but...

100
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,200
If you really want
to show appreciation,

101
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,600
Just give me
half the commission.

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,300
Gosh, you know,
I wish I could but, uh...

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,900
no.

104
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,000
Hey, listen,remember how everyone
 used to call you Dwight Junior

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,200
and how much you loved that?

106
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,000
Ha ha ha.
I loved it.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How would like to pretend
to be my son in order to land a sale?

108
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,100
If it'll lead to me
being a salesman,

109
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll pretend to be your friend.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Then, looks like
we have a deal...

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,200
son.

112
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,200
Hi, guys.

113
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,600
Hey, look who it is.

114
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,000
Sorry. Super-busy.
Pens coming in later.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,800
Just grabbing a java
before all hell breaks loose.

116
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,500
- Try this one.
- Thank you.

117
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,300
I don't really have time
to think about Pete right now.

118
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,500
I just have a lot going on with
this whole shipment of pens.

119
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,000
And I have a lot of people
trusting me,

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and I would feel super-guilty
if I broke anyone's trust.

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,700
About the pens.

122
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
You ready for your interview?

123
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,100
I was born ready!

124
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,700
No.
I suck at interviews.

125
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,800
I had Andy's job in the bag
until my interview.

126
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
Well, you shouldn't be
nervous about this.

127
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,500
This is a tiny start-up
with a bunch of guys 

128
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,100
just as dorky as Jim.

129
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,700
Yeah, I guess.

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,200
Really, you can't be scared
of a room full of Jims.

131
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,000
I love the guy, but he's
basically gumby with hair.

132
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,300
It's kind of funny.

133
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,300
Father and son sales team 
meeting with a father and son suit store.

134
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,400
You know, you're right!

135
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,900
We hadn't even thought of that,
had we, boy?

136
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,200
No, we sure hadn't, pop.

137
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,900
Oh!
You're a hunter, I see.

138
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,000
Spend your early mornings out in the blinds

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,500
like Clarky and me? Huh?

140
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,800
He calls me Clarky
'cause he's my dad.

141
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Guilty.

142
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,700
You don't meet
many hunters these days.

143
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,100
My dad is
the best hunter there is.

144
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,400
I mean, he's like
a serial killer... of animals.

145
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,900
One time he snuck up
behind a sleeping deer

146
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,600
and just sawed its head
right off-- it was sick!

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
It was his birthday.

148
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,500
Just turned three, so...

149
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
You guys, I kinda think
I want to try them all.

150
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,700
Is that crazy?

151
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,400
No. Look,
without a taste test,

152
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,000
how are we supposed to know
which flavors we like to reorder?

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,200
Taste test?
I'm in.

154
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Yolo

155
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,300
It's a thing.
It means you only live once.

156
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, we're aware
of what it means, Oscar.

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,500
You just do not look cool
saying it.

158
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,900
- Well--
- All right, everybody.

159
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,000
- Who's in?
- Yep.

160
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,700
Angela.

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,800
Don't make us come over there.

162
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,200
No, I don't-- no.

163
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,400
All right, let's go.

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,200
Can't I just agree
without putting my hand in?

165
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,700
- Absolutely not.
- No way.

166
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh, fine.

167
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,100
Okay, guys.

168
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,000
We all drink them all.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

170
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,800
Hey, Where's my ring?

171
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,200
I'm sure it'll turn up.

172
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes, ma'am, you wanna go
east on Franklin,

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
take that all the way
to Commonwealth.

174
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,600
You'll see us on the right side.
You can't miss us.

175
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,000
- Whoa.
- Yes.

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,900
And I want to reach
every demographic possible.

177
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,600
No, I hear what you're saying,
and we will.

178
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,000
The thing is, we gotta lock down
this key demographic first.

179
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,500
The rest will come.
I promise.

180
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,100
Just give me a couple weeks,
all right?

181
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,400
We're talking weeks here,
not months, right?

182
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Weeks.
Always weeks.

183
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,200
Man, the last time
I talked months was, like...

184
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,300
- a million weeks ago.
- All right. Good.

185
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,200
Thanks, Dennis, appreciate it.
Hey!

186
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,600
- How are you?
- Good.

187
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,500
- What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to see you.

188
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
- That's so great!
- Damn.

189
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,100
Jim, you got a real Facebook
energy going on here, man.

190
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,000
You Zuckerberged
this place out.

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's pretty great, right?
I mean, we're coming along--

192
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,500
hey, Wade, we gotta just push up
Dennis's timeline.

193
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,900
- Okay.
- Actually, you know what?

194
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,700
Give me one second, okay?
Make yourselves at home.

195
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,100
But I think that all of
your concerns will be answered

196
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,600
when you see the brochure that
Clark's getting out of my car.

197
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,000
He's a good boy.
Does whatever I say.

198
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,900
I can't relate to that.
My son hates my guts.

199
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,100
Oh?
Really?

200
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,500
Bring him into the business,
and he resents me.

201
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,400
How do you like that?

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, things
between me and Clark are good,not great.

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,800
In fact, I will say
that they're not even good.

204
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,900
Really, they're bad.
Like you and your son.

205
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,400
Here you go, pop.

206
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,900
I know it was just
a couple minutes, but...

207
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,200
- God, I missed you.
- What took you so long?

208
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,100
Were you loitering out there
like a Hooligan,Smoking a doobie?

209
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,500
I sure was.
Just like he taught me.

210
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,300
- Looking cool.
- You're being disrespectful!

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,700
And I love you...
for saying that.

212
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,800
We don't get along.

213
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,700
Ha ha!

214
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,500
I just burned him.

215
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,400
Because the truth is...

216
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,000
our relationship is...

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
- Ter-- terrible.
- Terrible.

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,600
Yes.
Genius.

219
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,900
Stupid, stupid genius!

220
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,200
Wow! This place is...
so great.

221
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,500
I had no idea-- on the phone,
you made it sound kind of dinky.

222
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,200
Well, I mean, I don't even
have the paycheck yet.

223
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,900
It is a start-up, so...

224
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,400
These things go down
all the time.

225
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,100
If this company's going down,
I wanna go down on it.

226
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
With it.
I wanna go down with it.

227
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,300
Are you cool to just hang out?

228
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,700
- Sure, no problem.
- Yeah?

229
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,000
- You ready?
- Yeah.

230
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Let's do it.

231
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,600
The pen delivery went amazing,

232
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,800
and now I've got all these pens
just waiting to be unpacked.

233
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,600
But Pam did not tell me
to unpack the pens,

234
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,500
and I'm not one of those people
who's just like, "uh, sure,

235
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,900
I'll accept the pens
when they come in,"

236
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,000
and then as soon
as your back's turned,

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,900
I unpack the pens and get all this
 credit and some great pen unpacker.

238
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,100
On the other hand...
they are just sitting here.

239
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Pam didn't tell me
not to unpack them.

240
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,100
Don't wanna be a busybody, but I
don't wanna be a lazybones.

241
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,000
Busybody, lazybones.
Busybody, lazybones.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,600
Aah! My brain is ping-ponging
around in my head right now.

243
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
It's insane.

244
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,700
I'm sorry.
What was your question again?

245
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,200
Oh, yeah.

246
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,100
No. I've never had
an espresso before.

247
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,200
They're good, though.

248
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,300
A-bam!

249
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,200
My favorite
is Viennese Amaretto.

250
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,900
And the worst flavor
I've tried so far is Alpine Select!

251
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,400
Yes!

252
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,200
- Ah!
- One!

253
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,800
- Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!
- Two!

254
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,000
- Stop it!
- Three!

255
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,200
- That's enough, Kevin.
- Stop it, Kevin! That's enough.
- Four

256
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,800
So for your menswear catalogue,
I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.

257
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,400
- I heard that before.
- Well, I understand, but-- 
- I bet you have.

258
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,300
He knows nothing About
 what people have heard before, my son.

259
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,000
Here we go again, another
lecture from the old man.

260
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
Listen to him.
He created you.

261
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
Maybe if you listened
a little bit, you'd improve.

262
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,400
No wonder women despise you.

263
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
Women don't despise me.

264
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
His last girlfriend
was a transvestite.

265
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,000
I knew it right away.

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Adam's apple
like the prow of a ship.

267
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,200
Thumbs like a lowland gorilla.

268
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,000
Ha. But this one couldn't see it
or didn't wanna see it.

269
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
All right, that's enough,
'cause I can say some things about him too.

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
- Yeah, like what?
- Like the time that you got drunk and-- and then...

271
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,300
killed those kids
on their way to prom.

272
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,200
That never happened.
He's always been a liar.

273
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,600
Ever since he was a little kid
 and he got caught "saving treats"

274
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,400
from the kitty litter box.

275
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,300
Really shameful.

276
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,600
So we can offer you matte
or glossy printing--

277
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch
in his trousers.

278
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,500
There's obviously
a volume discount if you--

279
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,000
Following the cat around
on his knees

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
with his hands cupped
beneath its tail,

281
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,400
going, "Please, kitty,
may I have some more?"

282
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,500
You can't make this stuff up!

283
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,600
No, I think someone
could make it up.

284
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,900
Someone with very few friends.

285
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,700
Hey, fellas,
sorry to keep you waiting.

286
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,800
There he is.
My son.

287
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,000
Got cat turd
collector written all over him.

288
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,600
Did you say cat turd collector?

289
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,200
So definitely looking
to expand our market,

290
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,800
but for now we're just concentrating on athletes
that are popular here in the Northeast.

291
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,200
Of course,
that's not a mandate.

292
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,100
"Mandate"-- always think
of two men on a date.

293
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,400
I have gay friends.

294
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,100
I have one gay friend.Oscar.


295
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Mm-hmm.

296
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,600
All right,so what makes you think 
you'd be a good fit here?

297
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,900
Okay.
Um...

298
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,400
all right.

299
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,300
Obviously,
y'all look really busy,

300
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,500
and I don't want to waste
your time anymore.

301
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,000
Sorry, I just, uh...

302
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,700
obviously, I'm not qualified
to be here, man, I'm...

303
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm a warehouse manager,
you know...

304
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,100
Darryl,I was a newspaper editor.

305
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,600
Science teacher.
Volleyball coach.

306
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,800
I work
at a home shopping network.

307
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,300
I'm a lawyer.

308
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
I'm the only one here
who can honestly help.

309
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,700
And as you know,
I was a paper salesman.

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,500
Hey, I find it helps if you just
picture everybody naked.

311
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,400
Cool.

312
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,100
Hey, thanks.

313
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,500
So how about we start over, hmm?

314
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,000
Darryl, do you have
any thoughts on the company?

315
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I, uh...

316
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,600
- I wrote some down.
- Oh.

317
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,000
There you go.

318
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,200
Wow, this guy came prepared.
It impresses me!

319
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,700
Ah. So this is what 2:00 PM
looks like around here.

320
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,900
I usually take a siesta
about now.

321
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,900
Stocking pens, huh?

322
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,400
You're like
the new office administrator.

323
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,800
No. I just took over
the pen shipment because Pam had to leave.

324
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,500
When I say it out loud,
I know that sounds insane,

325
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,000
- but it's the truth, I swear.
- Pam!

326
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,700
Pam, look out!

327
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
- Erin's gunning for your job!
- No, I'm not.

328
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,700
It's not like that at all.

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,900
- Forget it. I'm so sorry.
- Pam, look out!

330
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,800
Pens, you did not
buy into this.

331
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,200
I am sorry.
What a day you've had.

332
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,700
By the way, Jim talks
about you all the time.

333
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,400
That's sweet
that he talks about me.

334
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,800
It's too bad he still has
to work part-time in Scranton though.

335
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,500
Well, that's funny,
'cause I think of him as working part-time in Philadelphia.

336
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,100
We can't wait
until you move here.

337
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
I'm sorry-- you guys are here
to sell us paper?

338
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,500
Do you mind?
The men are talking.

339
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Sons used to idolize
their fathers.

340
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,800
Us old-timers
need to stick together.

341
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,000
And how better
than by signing a contract?

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,200
I'd love to.

343
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,900
Sam Junior here,
he runs the business now.

344
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,000
Kinda pushed me out,
truth be told.

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,700
I'm just here
for human contact.

346
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Okay, pop.

347
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,200
Wait.
So you're the boss?

348
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,500
That's right.

349
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,500
- Hi. I'm Clark.
- Hey.

350
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,000
- Let's talk.
- Okay.

351
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,500
So if you look
at our catalog here...

352
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,300
- Well,thanks for coming down, Darryl.
- It was nice meeting you,
Darryl.

353
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,600
I think you'd fit in great here.

354
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,200
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.

355
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I think it'd be like...

356
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,600
you know what?

357
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,400
I think it'd be like
a Kevin Durant jump shot--

358
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,000
<i>perfecto!</i>

359
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,900
Oh, my God.

360
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,800
They are the ones put a fish tank
next to a basketball hoop.

361
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,000
It's like if I put
a glass of milk

362
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
on the edge of the table
and Cece knocks it over,

363
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't blame Cece.

364
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So I'm like a three-year-old
girl in this scenario.

365
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,800
Say they don't hire you.

366
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,600
It's not like
you're out on the street.

367
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,300
You have a great job
with people who love you.

368
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,900
And I'd only get to see Jada
on the weekends.

369
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,000
You know, I'm... I'm not so sure 

370
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,300
I'd like living in Philadelphia.

371
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,900
Right? Thank you!
It's just Philly.

372
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,800
Everyone's acting like it's
New York or Paris or London.

373
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,400
- Who needs it?
- Not us.

374
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Okay.
So the consensus was that that was unique.

375
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,900
They're gonna make you pay
for the fish,

376
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,800
and...they wanted to know
when you can start.

377
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,300
What?

378
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,500
How 'bout yesterday?

379
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,800
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

380
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I guess you gotta move
to Philly after all.

381
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,400
Yes, I love Philly!

382
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,200
Two-one-five or die!

383
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,900
No, I'm not upset.
I'm really excited for Darryl.

384
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,200
Maybe I'm a little disappointed 
that we'll be losing him.

385
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,100
It feels really hot in here.
Is it hot in here?

386
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,300
It feels really,
really hot in here.

387
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,900
It's insane! They need
to have the AC on year-round!

388
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,200
January too!

389
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,400
I don't get the point
of this stupid window!

390
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,600
I mean, look,
you and I both know that in paper or fashion,

391
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,100
styles change.

392
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,000
Check out my dad's suit.

393
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You are looking
at pure acrylic.

394
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,900
That's why his face
always breaks out.

395
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Does that suit
come with a fire extinguisher?

396
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,400
Ha ha ha.

397
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,700
You know what, dad?
Maybe you should buy me a suit.

398
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,900
I mean,I'm gonna need one, right,
if I'm ever gonna get a "real" job

399
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,900
and move "my lazy ass"
out of your "GD house."

400
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,800
He's got ya there.

401
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,900
That's Italian silk.
Very comfortable.Very tasteful...

402
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,600
although expensive.

403
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,200
Yeah, you don't want Italian.
You'll look like a mafia don.

404
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,600
Next thing you know, you'll be
doing life in Rikers Island.

405
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,800
Well, that's better than
looking like the undertaker from boring island.

406
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,400
That place doesn't exist.

407
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,900
It's not a documented island.

408
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,000
Cartograph much?

409
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,000
How do I look?

410
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,800
Actually...
you look great.

411
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,100
They steered you right.

412
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,900
I guess it does make sense
buying from a father-son team.

413
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,000
You know what?

414
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,800
I'll take one too.

415
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,100
Everyone, now that we have
all this energy,

416
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,700
why don't we move the copier
into the annex like we've always wanted to?

417
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,500
- Whoo!
- Frickin' A!

418
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,800
So long, noise!

419
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,100
One, two, three!

420
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,900
Oh!

421
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,700
And we have torn up the carpet.

422
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,800
- Oh, we're gonna be in so much trouble!
- Wait!

423
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,300
It's beautiful.

424
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,600
Hardwood.

425
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,700
I always knew it was down here.

426
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,200
I just never dreamed
that I would actually see it.

427
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,000
Tear up the carpet!

428
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Kill their fish,
and they still hire me.

429
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,800
That's how you do that, baby.

430
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,700
It's all good.
I'm ready.

431
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,300
Y'all ready for this?

432
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,100
* Every body dance now *

433
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,100
Kevin, move.
I can't pull up the rug

434
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,200
If you're standing on it
with your rhinoceros feet.

435
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,000
WEll, I can't stand here 
if you pull the carpet out from under me.

436
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,200
Oh, my head is killing me.

437
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Does anyone have
a baby Aspirin?

438
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,800
Oh,
enough with the whining already.

439
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,300
Why don't you just have
some more coffee?

440
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,400
It's all gone.

441
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
I didn't get a chance
to try them all

442
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
because creed poured
my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.

443
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,200
I saw the leaves twitch.

444
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,300
- Shut up.
- You shut up!

445
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,000
Everybody shut up and work.

446
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,900
- We don't work for you.
- Yeah.

447
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,200
- Yeah.
- Hey.

448
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,700
It's 5:00.

449
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,300
- Kevin, can--
- What is going on?

450
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,300
Yes!
We did it!

451
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,800
You opened the door.

452
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,200
And you closed it.
The boys are back in town.

453
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,500
High fives!
Ha ha!

454
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Hey, so all that really
specific cat turd business--

455
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,100
that was about you, right?

456
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,700
You got me!

457
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,300
- I used to collect 'em.
- Why?

458
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,100
Each one is very different,
like a snowflake.

459
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,700
Hey.What happened here?

460
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
You left me in charge
of the pens, Pam.

461
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,800
That's what happened.
The pens happened.

462
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,600
Are the pens here?
