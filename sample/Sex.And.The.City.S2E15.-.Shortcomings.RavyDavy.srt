1
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,244
Everyone has a worst nlghtmare.

2
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,218
For some, lt's bathlng-sult season.

3
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:59,621
For others, lt's that your blrth certlflcate
can never be legally destroyed.

4
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:03,253
For Mlranda, lt was famlly hour at her gym.

5
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,088
What the....

6
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:15,872
Klddy Jazzerclse,
Aeroblcs Room 1, flve mlnutes.

7
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:20,904
On Sundays, her nelghborhood became
occupled terrltory under slege to chlldren.

8
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,208
They were everywhere.:

9
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,115
Movle theaters, restaurants,
bookstores, halr salons....

10
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,177
Starbucks was baslcally
a stroller parklng lot.

11
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:32,484
Was lt too much to hope
for one small space to call her own?

12
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,319
Don't touch it, pIease!

13
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,958
Is there a probIem?

14
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,967
No, it's just that
he reaIIy Iikes to push the button.

15
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,295
Fine, I'm in kind of a rush. Push One.

16
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,969
Simon, this pretty Iady said
that you couId push the button.

17
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,670
-So sorry.
-I'm sure it's just a phase.

18
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:59,246
Yeah, the guiIty, overinduIgent
phase of a D-I-V-O-R-C-E.

19
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,857
-Daddy.
-Simon, we're not being very nice to....

20
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:15,299
-That sounds Iike a princess name.
-Stop taIking.

21
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,438
I'm going to bite you.

22
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,907
-Do you want to go to the toy store Iater?
-Yes.

23
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,807
Then don't bite me.

24
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,707
I am in vioIation
of every parenting book ever written.

25
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,349
-Do you have kids?
-No.

26
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,579
Married?

27
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,855
-Here we are.
-At Iast.

28
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,160
Any chance I couId persuade you
to take another ride?

29
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,070
Hls name was Roger Cobb.

30
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:58,441
It only took hlm another floor and a half
to ask Mlranda for her phone number.

31
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,809
The whole thlng mlght have been
very romantlc...

32
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,973
...lf Slmon hadn't peed ln hls pants.

33
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,383
I don't wear vintage cIothes,
I hate fIea markets, I don't coIIect antiques.

34
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,650
Is it too much to ask that he not be,
I don't know, used?

35
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:15,091
Before it goes any further, just make sure
his parts are stiII under warranty.

36
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,230
-It's Iike chewing somebody eIse's gum.
-Divorced men do come with baggage.

37
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,927
Baggage is one thing.
But when they come with kids....

38
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,231
EspeciaIIy kids with bIadder controI issues.

39
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,769
Here's what I think.

40
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,966
Round up aII the divorced men
and keep them in a pound.

41
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:32,067
That way, you get their whoIe history
before you take one home.

42
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,807
If a man is divorced,
it doesn't mean he has a probIem.

43
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,146
Like my brother WesIey.
He just separated from his wife, LesIie--

44
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:44,354
-WesIey and LesIie? I don't think so.
-What is that, marriage by Mother Goose?

45
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,825
DefiniteIy a candidate for the pound.

46
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,421
I was going to ask you to meet him 'cause
he's coming to visit, and now forget it.

47
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,933
We want to meet WesIey
of WesIey and LesIie.

48
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,434
And p.s., does he work for NestI¨¦?

49
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,801
My brother's very important to me.

50
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,603
I won't have him subjected
to scrutiny and ridicuIe.

51
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,810
-I'II be Scrutiny. You be RidicuIe.
-I aIways have to be RidicuIe.

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,711
Why can't you be RidicuIe for once?

53
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:10,771
I know.

54
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,143
As for me, rather than sort
through the half-off bln...

55
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,746
...I was datlng
someone brand-spanklng new.

56
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,393
I met Vaughn Welsel at a P.E.N. luncheon
a month ago.

57
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,997
It's amazlng how much better looklng
flctlon wrlters have become.

58
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,326
StiII up for a movie?

59
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,358
I just gotta drop these books
by my parent's pIace. It's on the way.

60
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,597
-GQ caIIed.
-They want you to write something?

61
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,699
They want me to wear something.

62
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,439
It's so great to be a writer these days,
there's so IittIe writing invoIved.

63
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,743
Don't be photographed
in anything sIeeveIess.

64
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,511
No one who went sIeeveIess
ever won a PuIitzer.

65
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,076
It's just a IittIe tip from me to you.

66
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,188
Nice townhouse.

67
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,761
-Come on in, this wiII onIy take a second.
-I'm not dressed for famiIy.

68
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,296
Can you just drop them
through the maiI sIot?

69
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,389
If I'm here and I don't say heIIo...

70
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,197
...I'm Iooking at two months minimum
hard famiIy time.

71
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,466
AII right. Yeah, okay.

72
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,365
Thank you.

73
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:13,173
Mother, I swear, you are the onIy person
who can kiII a cactus.

74
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:15,905
This is Carrie.

75
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:20,282
TeII your sister to stop bringing me pIants.
They get suicidaI around me.

76
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,913
I have to taIk them down from the Iedge.

77
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:28,056
-Those books you asked me to sign....
-Duncan, Vaughn's here.

78
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,691
And he brought a girI!

79
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,322
-Hi. WaIIis WeiseI...
-Hi.

80
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:37,569
-Have we met?
-No, I don't think so. Carrie Bradshaw.

81
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,570
My God. Duncan, get your ass in here.

82
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,168
I just Iove your coIumn.

83
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,506
I Iove to hear that.

84
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,482
-Mom, we can't stay.
-The heII you can't.

85
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,849
You know what you shouId write about?
Re-virginization.

86
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,851
Did you know there are women
who are actuaIIy having...

87
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,552
...their vaginas re-stitched
to make them Iike new again?

88
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,656
Aren't they cIever?

89
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,461
If you're wondering, Mom just finished
a documentary on genitaI mutiIation.

90
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,694
Which I stiII haven't gotten your notes on.

91
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,397
I toId you, I can't bring myseIf
to Iook at that thing.

92
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:17,307
And I typed aII his short stories for him
when he was 12. Duncan, Iook.

93
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,910
Do you know who this is?
Carrie Bradshaw.

94
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,642
-She writes that coIumn we Iove.
-What are you doing Thursday night?

95
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:25,884
Laundry.

96
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,612
I teach a seminar at CoIumbia
on CuIturaI Zeitgeist.

97
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,450
I'd Iove to have you come speak.

98
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,617
Mr. SeIf-InvoIved here
didn't teII us he was dating an icon.

99
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,890
-Icon?
-You are an icon. You are.

100
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,793
-Who brought a girI?
-This is my other sister.

101
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,563
Franny, this is Carrie.

102
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,328
-What's up?
-What's up?

103
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,963
-Hey, mom.
-Hi, sweetie.

104
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,799
Franny and Zooey?

105
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,170
What can I say?
J.D. SaIinger used to get me high.

106
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:57,214
And then she'd caII me at 3:00 a.m.,
''I Iove you.''

107
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,178
Good for you.
BeautifuI and she thinks I'm funny.

108
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,850
You're hiIarious. Put your tongue back
in your head and the Iox on the tabIe.

109
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,483
Come on, everybody,
Iet's have something to eat.

110
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:13,054
-We have to go.
-Come on, pIease.

111
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,266
We'II stay.

112
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,966
I mean, really,
wlthln the space of flve mlnutes...

113
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,770
...I had next week's column, an lnvltatlon
to speak at an Ivy League unlverslty...

114
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,904
...and access
to the entlre Zabar's flsh counter.

115
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,014
Leave now? Was he nuts?

116
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,683
Have you ever gone out
with someone who had a kid?

117
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,282
No, but I've never gone out with someone
I met on an eIevator either.

118
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,861
That's a first for me, too.

119
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,955
I met a woman on an escaIator once,
but it didn't Iast Iong.

120
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,626
It was over by the time
we got to Ladies Lingerie.

121
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,602
I dated a man once
who wore Iadies' Iingerie.

122
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,368
That was kind of the probIem there.
I'm kidding.

123
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,511
-'Cause I'm wearing panties now.
-You're kidding, right?

124
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,442
Look what I found.

125
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,746
-Can you say you're sorry?
-No!

126
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,046
Are you okay?

127
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,112
FortunateIy, I mostIy use
the right side of my brain.

128
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,523
It must be hard,
having a sociaI Iife as a singIe parent.

129
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,461
It is, I got to buy protective heImets
for aII my dates.

130
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,965
Where's mine, by the way?

131
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,768
The truth is, I didn't reaIIy have
a great sociaI Iife before Simon either.

132
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:34,038
I'm just one of those weird maIe
aberrations who prefers to be married.

133
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:40,175
I Iike stabiIity and routine. I Iike knowing
there's peopIe waiting for me at home.

134
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,318
-I guess that makes me sound pretty duII.
-Are you kidding?

135
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,358
You're the HeterosexuaI HoIy GraiI.

136
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,628
Mlranda wondered how a vlntage man
mlght look on her modern couch.

137
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,426
-Here.
-Thank you.

138
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,864
ProbabIy not the best time
to ask you to dinner.

139
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,442
Whlle Mlranda was deallng
wlth queaslness...

140
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,570
...Charlotte was handllng depresslon...

141
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,878
...whlch she felt could be solved
wlth a homemade muffln.

142
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,350
Here you go. Just Iike Nana used to make.

143
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,319
CharIie, the muffins are great,
but I'd much prefer a nice dry martini.

144
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,823
But Nana aIways made muffins
to cheer you up.

145
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:24,222
That was pre-LesIie. Post-LesIie,
I need a cocktaiI. Where's your vodka?

146
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,455
-I don't have any.
-And you caII yourseIf a Wasp.

147
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:32,434
I don't see why you two can't work it out,
you had the most beautifuI wedding.

148
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,438
We'II have an even IoveIier divorce.

149
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,136
I can't beIieve you're wiIIing
to just throw it aII away so easiIy.

150
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,271
ReIationships take work.
You need patience and understanding.

151
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,780
When was your Iast
Iong-term reIationship?

152
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,650
Just eat your muffin.

153
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,460
The afternoon had been
llke slx hours of foreplay.

154
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,342
Some men seduce
wlth dlm llghts and soft muslc.

155
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,573
Vaughn seduced
wlth chocolate chlp cookles and relatlves.

156
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,785
It was lnevltable thls would happen.

157
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,394
I just dldn't know
lt would happen so qulckly.

158
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,389
I'II get a tissue.

159
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,109
Get out now,
before he stains aII your sheets.

160
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,377
Come on, that's harsh.
It couId be he was just nervous.

161
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,917
First time is aIways weird.

162
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,580
-He probabIy had something to drink.
-We'd spent the day with his famiIy.

163
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,814
The guy couId not get
his CadiIIac into the garage.

164
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,826
I'm sorry, I hate being right about this.

165
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,295
Samantha was the General Patton of sex.

166
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,167
She dldn't send her troops
lnto battle lf she thought they would lose.

167
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,391
I Iike him.

168
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,402
That's sweII, but it doesn't
get the cream in the cupcake.

169
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,906
But the thing I Iike best about him
is his famiIy.

170
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,374
Anyone there you can fuck?

171
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,871
What? I'm trying to be heIpfuI.

172
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:25,507
I'm teIIing you, this famiIy is Iike....
They got charisma.

173
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,176
Like Tom Cruise,
they're the Tom Cruise of famiIies.

174
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,688
I'm sure the famiIy is supposed
to be the obstacIe to a reIationship...

175
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,054
...not the attraction.

176
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,593
I fucked a guy once
because his famiIy had a pooI.

177
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:40,261
He was pretty much of a nerd, but I'd go
over there and get aII cocoa-buttered up.

178
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,631
His mom Ioved me. She was aIways
serving me KooI-Aid and chips.

179
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,570
-KooI-Aid?
-Yeah, KooI-Aid, I was 13.

180
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,165
And honey, you shouId have seen my tan.

181
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,110
In my mlnd, the compllcatlons of maklng
a relatlonshlp work...

182
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,580
...had just expanded exponentlally.

183
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:01,314
When you date someone, how many
people become emotlonally lnvolved?

184
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:05,481
When you sleep wlth someone,
are you screwlng the famlly?

185
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,158
Whlle I was stlll on the fence
about Vaughn...

186
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,890
...I had no doubt about
my feellng for hls mother.

187
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,625
I was ln love wlth her.

188
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,829
Then we were in Nicaragua
with the Peace Corps.

189
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,798
That's where Vaughn was born.

190
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,238
I can't get over it. You've had five Iives.

191
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,305
I can bareIy make one happen.

192
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,241
Don't puII that seIf-effacing shit with me.

193
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,838
I see you. I know what you've got going.

194
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,647
What? What do I do?
I write this IittIe coIumn.

195
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,155
It's a contribution.
You are putting it out there.

196
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,855
You're part of a diaIogue.

197
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,416
If it wasn't for you...

198
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:47,124
...we wouIdn't know haIf the things we do
about other peopIe's sex Iives.

199
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,501
-Thanks a Iot.
-I'm teasing.

200
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:55,097
No, it's wonderfuI
to be frank and honest about sex.

201
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,871
That's how I raised my kids.
Sex was aIways a part of the discussion.

202
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:04,472
When they were 2 years oId, they knew
the proper names for their body parts.

203
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,882
None of this ''pee-pee''
and ''wee-wee'' crap.

204
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,480
And as a resuIt,
they can taIk to me about anything.

205
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,916
When Franny toId me she was a Iesbian...

206
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,995
...I said, ''Great, just as Iong
as you're not a RepubIican.''

207
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:23,996
-May I just say I Iike you very much.
-That's dear, thank you.

208
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,698
Did you taIk to LesIie today?

209
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,641
No. I taIked to her Iawyer.
Do you want to know about that?

210
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,770
I'm giving her the house
and she's giving me an uIcer.

211
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,407
I'm sorry I brought it up.
Tonight we'II have fun.

212
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,418
You'II finaIIy meet my friend Carrie.

213
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,954
We'II go out, have dinner,
maybe go to a cIub....

214
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:43,989
Shit.

215
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,029
This is my wonderfuI brother, WesIey.

216
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,503
-Nice to meet you.
-Good Iooks run in the famiIy.

217
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,002
-Can I get you Iadies a drink?
-CosmopoIitan.

218
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,130
Ditto.

219
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,436
-How are you enjoying New York?
-Excuse us.

220
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,843
Why is she here?

221
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,516
That's our friend.
I beIieve you remember Samantha.

222
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,751
You know how she gets.
Look! She's doing it aIready.

223
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,415
They're taIking.

224
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:27,096
Samantha says there's
a great jazz bar that we shouId go to.

225
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,466
-I just don't think I'm up for it tonight.
-Then maybe we'II just go.

226
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,372
TaIking and going to hear jazz.

227
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,878
I think I have your son's SIinky
embedded in my back.

228
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,915
I Iike to brand my women.

229
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,951
I'm going to use the bathroom,
and then I reaIIy wiII go.

230
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,127
-Daddy?
-No, Simon!

231
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,796
Daddy!

232
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,263
Shit.

233
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,107
I'm sorry. I was peeing,
and I didn't want him to see me.

234
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,207
I was afraid he'd see me...

235
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:22,812
...and then he'd be drawing pictures for
a chiId psychoIogist and nobody's happy.

236
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,948
-I'II get a Band-Aid.
-He's hurt. He might need a stitch.

237
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,785
-I'II go with you to the emergency room.
-No!

238
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,957
Just go.

239
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,664
PIease, just go.

240
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,498
One thlng about famllles...

241
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,734
...lf no one's sorry to see you go,
then you're probably not comlng back.

242
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,075
The next mornlng,
Charlotte was ln for a rude awakenlng.

243
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,180
Where do you keep your coffee fiIters?

244
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,745
Just teII me if I'm warm.

245
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,713
My brother? You sIept with my brother?

246
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,893
Honey, what a doII. He reaIIy--

247
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,495
Is your vagina
in the New York City guidebooks?

248
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:08,465
It shouId be, it's the hottest spot in town!
It's aIways open!

249
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,268
What's going on?

250
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,772
What did you say?

251
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,245
She was in my kitchen,
she was wearing your shirt, I snapped.

252
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:31,089
Who asked you to butt your nose
into my.... Samantha, wait! Don't go!

253
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,824
I didn't know your mom
was nominated for an Oscar.

254
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,728
Best Documentary Short.

255
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,901
I just Iove that she stiII has
so many ambitions for herseIf.

256
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,466
I'm not reaIIy in the mood
to taIk about my mom.

257
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,677
I'm not reaIIy in the mood to taIk at aII.

258
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,485
Don't touch it!

259
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,918
What was the documentary short
about anyway?

260
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,384
Good, you're back.

261
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,786
I swear to God, if you hand me a muffin,
I'm out of here.

262
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,531
You don't know Samantha. I do.

263
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:50,557
She has so many notches on her bedpost,
it's aImost whittIed down to a toothpick.

264
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,967
It was fun.

265
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,562
I know.

266
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,336
You had your IittIe fIing, now you can
go back to LesIie and work it out.

267
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,175
We're not working it out.
You think you know WesIey and LesIie?

268
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,439
Let me teII you about WesIey and LesIie.

269
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:08,180
LesIie's frigid and before Iast night,
WesIey hadn't gotten Iaid in two years.

270
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,352
-My God.
-I was going out of my mind.

271
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,482
I've seen a pastor. I've seen a shrink.

272
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:18,222
But untiI I saw Samantha,
I didn't reaIize what I reaIIy needed: sex.

273
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,192
-So it was a good thing.
-It was a frigging great thing.

274
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,665
That Samantha....

275
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,360
You've reaIIy got a good friend there.

276
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,072
It's CharIotte.

277
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,813
-That was a terribIe thing I said.
-Yes, it was.

278
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,488
If you'II excuse me...

279
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,892
...I have another tour group coming
through my vagina in 10 minutes.

280
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,260
I'm so sorry.

281
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,425
-You said what you came to say?
-Wait!

282
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,335
I wanted to give you this.

283
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,977
Samantha was touched.

284
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,141
She reallzed
thls was Charlotte's way of saylng...

285
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,783
''...Thank you for fucklng my brother.''

286
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,217
Get in there.

287
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,118
Hey, kldsI Funtastlcs on Three.

288
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:28,157
Mlranda declded she had ceded
enough terrltory to the lnvadlng troops.

289
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,766
Do you mind?
He reaIIy Ioves to push the button.

290
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,500
Yeah? So do I.

291
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,383
That is so sexy.

292
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,879
You in bed with my book.

293
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,183
It's reaIIy great.

294
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:01,127
-Do that again.
-What, turn the page?

295
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,328
Baby.

296
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:10,730
Again.

297
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,740
Wait, stop.

298
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,316
Let's just take this nice and sIow.

299
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:29,483
You teII me if you're feeIing too excited
and we'II take a IittIe break.

300
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,756
Why?

301
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,756
Because I think we both
reaIIy want this to work.

302
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,332
I Iove that you get so turned on by me...

303
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,474
...and I am very turned on by you.

304
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,580
Maybe we've just been
in too much of a rush.

305
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,614
-Forget it.
-No, I don't want to forget it. Come here.

306
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:00,287
-Let's taIk about it.
-No! I don't want to taIk about it.

307
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,316
I think we have to.

308
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:06,323
Why does everything have to be about sex!
I am so sick of taIking about sex.

309
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,992
I've been taIking about it since I was 2.

310
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,062
So Iet's go.

311
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,431
My parents are expecting us.

312
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:21,702
Duncan and I went down to
the NeiI Simon Theater and spent $65--

313
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,804
$75.

314
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,142
To see a British movie star
simuIate a bIowjob.

315
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,876
I wonder if that's what NeiI had in mind.

316
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,691
-Did she show her tits?
-No. How's the pickIed herring?

317
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,559
It's very good.

318
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,790
Franny teIIs me that you two
are going camping this weekend.

319
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:43,457
-Where's the scaIIion cream cheese?
-It's out there on the tabIe.

320
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,697
I don't see it.

321
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,566
Then check the refrigerator.

322
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,575
-Why is he so edgy?
-I have no idea.

323
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,742
-Don't Iet him puII that moody shit on you.
-I know. It's such a pose.

324
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,582
Since he got pubIished,
he's suddenIy this tortured artist.

325
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,884
-Where's the cream cheese?
-It's out there.

326
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,200
Why buy this shit if you can't remember
the one thing that hoIds it aII together?

327
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:26,235
Let's deaI with what's reaIIy upsetting you.
ShaII we?

328
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,910
If everything's on the tabIe, why don't we
start with some scaIIion cream cheese?

329
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:39,319
Jenna and I looked at each other
llke two forelgners wlthout vlsas.

330
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:47,461
You know what, I think I'd better go.
I've got a deadIine.

331
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,538
I'II go. Thank you for Iunch, for everything.

332
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,915
What happened?
Everything was going so weII.

333
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,880
It reaIIy wasn't.

334
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,720
I know what it is.
His Iast girIfriend wasn't as discreet.

335
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,661
I don't want to get in the irony.
He writes short stories.

336
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,932
This has officiaIIy become too weird.

337
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,162
ReaIIy, in a situation Iike this,
you gotta Iaugh.

338
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:32,140
AII right, it's a probIem.
But you'II work it out.

339
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,573
He won't even taIk about it.

340
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,909
-You want me to taIk to him?
-No.

341
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:46,382
-I can't discuss this with you.
-You can! You and I can discuss anything.

342
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,920
So your sex Iife isn't so great. So what?

343
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,523
Seventy-seven percent
of aII marriages are sexIess.

344
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,830
Other things are so much more important,
Iike famiIy.

345
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:04,135
Then I saw that the person I really
had to break up wlth wasn't Vaughn.

346
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,938
It was hls mother.

347
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:12,446
I wouId stiII Iike us to be friends.
No, I mean that.

348
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,243
And what happens
when you meet somebody eIse?

349
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,788
I can teII you now, they won't have
a mother Iike me. You know that.

350
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:26,456
You know that we have something.
What we have is very speciaI.

351
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,230
AII right, weII.

352
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,699
CaII me sometime.

353
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,543
-I wiII.
-Sweetie.

354
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,848
Wallls was rlght. The most
lmportant thlng ln llfe ls your famlly.

355
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,752
There are days you love them,
and others you don't.

356
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,727
But ln the end, they're the people
you always come home to.

357
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,264
Sometlmes lt's the famlly you're born lnto.

358
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,994
And sometlmes lt's the one
you make for yourself.

359
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,202
-What are you doing here?
-Come here.
