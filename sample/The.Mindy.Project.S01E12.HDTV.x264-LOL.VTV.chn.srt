00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:03,815
×ÖÄ»
Mindy, I had the most amazing encounter last night.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,584
×ÖÄ»
I met a woman at the merch table

3
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:07,152
×ÖÄ»
of a performance of The Lion King.

4
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:10,222
×ÖÄ»
Let's just say she felt the love last night.

5
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:12,038
×ÖÄ»
Mindy, did a--

6
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:14,206
×ÖÄ»
Oh, my God! Oh, God, Jeremy, I'm so sorry.

7
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:15,841
×ÖÄ»
Wow. Jeremy, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

8
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:17,243
×ÖÄ»
I forgot I was wearing this.

9
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:19,045
×ÖÄ»
I spend so many nights here now,

10
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,146
×ÖÄ»
and I'm scared of getting murdered.

11
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,380
×ÖÄ»
So I figure, if I'm wearing this,

12
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:22,815
×ÖÄ»
murderers will think I'm a murderer

13
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:24,116
×ÖÄ»
and they'll just go, "Eh,

14
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,484
×ÖÄ»
too many cooks in the kitchen."

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,953
×ÖÄ»
You know, you're here constantly.

16
00:00:26,987 --> 00:00:28,821
×ÖÄ»
Well, my plan was to marry rich

17
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:30,489
×ÖÄ»
and then stop working, or to marry old,

18
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:32,325
×ÖÄ»
and then when the guy died, inherit all his money.

19
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,493
×ÖÄ»
But old guys think I have sass mouth.

20
00:00:34,528 --> 00:00:36,429
×ÖÄ»
No, you're going about it all wrong, Mindy.

21
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:38,364
×ÖÄ»
I mean, yeah, it's hard to mix work and love.

22
00:00:38,398 --> 00:00:40,666
×ÖÄ»
But it's not hard to mix work and sex.

23
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:42,935
×ÖÄ»
I like sex. Tell me more.

24
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,004
×ÖÄ»
Well, I had an hour between deliveries,

25
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:47,340
×ÖÄ»
and I met this very nubile Russian ballerina

26
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:49,075
×ÖÄ»
at an Internet cafe.

27
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,210
×ÖÄ»
Hey, man, don't tell me sex stories.

28
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:52,545
×ÖÄ»
Oh. I mean, tell me more about--yeah.

29
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,746
×ÖÄ»
Come on. All I'm saying is,

30
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,314
×ÖÄ»
maybe you should consider a more,

31
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:57,083
×ÖÄ»
I don't know, casual arrangement.

32
00:00:57,117 --> 00:00:58,451
×ÖÄ»
I don't know. Remember, we tried that,

33
00:00:58,485 --> 00:00:59,819
×ÖÄ»
and it kinda sucked. That wasn't casual for you.

34
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:02,455
×ÖÄ»
You loved me. Okay. I don't know that I loved you--

35
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,689
×ÖÄ»
You were deeply and fully in love with me.

36
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:05,691
×ÖÄ»
I again--I think that-- No, it's okay.

37
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:07,226
×ÖÄ»
All I'm saying is, if you want

38
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,761
×ÖÄ»
to start enjoying life, skip the date,

39
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:10,396
×ÖÄ»
move on to the good part.

40
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,900
×ÖÄ»
Ow!

41
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:16,836
×ÖÄ»
Are you kidding me? Why are you wearing that?

42
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,104
×ÖÄ»
'Cause I don't want to get murdered, Danny!

43
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:20,106
×ÖÄ»
That doesn't clarify anything!

00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:36,889
×ÖÄ»
Hey, Danny. Can you trade mouses with me?

46
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:38,524
×ÖÄ»
Mine's all oily.

47
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:40,426
×ÖÄ»
Wait, why are the midwives here?

48
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,561
×ÖÄ»
Because this morning when I came to work

49
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:44,530
×ÖÄ»
I was greeted by water coming from my ceiling,

50
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:48,467
×ÖÄ»
because their stupid water birth tub exploded over the weekend.

51
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:50,269
×ÖÄ»
You know what this joker does?

52
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:54,140
×ÖÄ»
He gives me this Healing Anger book by some new-age weirdo.

53
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:57,476
×ÖÄ»
I suppose some would call the Dalai Lama a new age weirdo.

54
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,612
×ÖÄ»
Chinese communists, maybe.

55
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:01,681
×ÖÄ»
Hi, Mindy. Don't "Hi" Me, Deslaurier.

56
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:03,182
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, don't "Hi" Her.

57
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:04,650
×ÖÄ»
You might trick some of our patients

58
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:06,619
×ÖÄ»
to defect to your sham midwife operation

59
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:07,987
×ÖÄ»
that you have going on, but you can't trick us

60
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,355
×ÖÄ»
into saying hi to you. Hi.

61
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,957
×ÖÄ»
Hi. Damn it. What do you say, Duncan?

62
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:14,427
×ÖÄ»
Shall we take our oolong and say so long?

63
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:16,128
×ÖÄ»
That's lame. Got your--

64
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:18,798
×ÖÄ»
Oh, hey, no one told me about the cool convention.

65
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:20,199
×ÖÄ»
Hi, Duncan. Hey, Morgan.

66
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:23,069
×ÖÄ»
Don't talk to him. They're not our friends, Morgan.

67
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:24,704
×ÖÄ»
I gotta check something in my file.

68
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:26,205
×ÖÄ»
Hi, Duncan.

69
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:34,580
×ÖÄ»
Psst. Shauna.

70
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:37,149
×ÖÄ»
Hmm? I know that you're with officer Stassen right now,

71
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,852
×ÖÄ»
but before that, did you ever engage

72
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:41,954
×ÖÄ»
in anything kind of, like, casual?

73
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:43,589
×ÖÄ»
People seem to be having these awesome sex lives,

74
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,591
×ÖÄ»
and I'm just trying to, like, find a life partner

75
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,793
×ÖÄ»
to go apple-picking with. What's wrong with me?

76
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:49,595
×ÖÄ»
Dr. L, are you thinking about having a one-night stand?

77
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,263
×ÖÄ»
'Cause, take it from me, they are the pits.

78
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:52,565
×ÖÄ»
That's okay, Morgan.

79
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,100
×ÖÄ»
I wasn't really opening it up to the floor,

80
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,768
×ÖÄ»
so you can just-- No, no, I'm invested now.

81
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:57,328
×ÖÄ»
Okay. Listen to me.

82
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:58,404
×ÖÄ»
You are too pure to be having

83
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,164
×ÖÄ»
a bunch of gross sex with randos.

84
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,265
×ÖÄ»
I was never--

85
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:02,600
×ÖÄ»
You are like a little baby deer, you know?

86
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,135
×ÖÄ»
You got little white spots on you,

87
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,403
×ÖÄ»
and you're eating a bottle of milk,

88
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:08,939
×ÖÄ»
and you got to wait for your ten-point buck.

89
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:10,608
×ÖÄ»
And then the two of you get married

90
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,276
×ÖÄ»
under, like, a canopy in the forest,

91
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,544
×ÖÄ»
and the rabbits are there,

92
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:16,046
×ÖÄ»
and there's, like, a owl who's the priest.

93
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:17,648
×ÖÄ»
And I really want that.

94
00:03:17,682 --> 00:03:19,984
×ÖÄ»
Just getting kind of impatient, you know.

95
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:21,218
×ÖÄ»
I want to have fun.

96
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:22,620
×ÖÄ»
Don't feel bad, Dr. L.

97
00:03:22,654 --> 00:03:24,955
×ÖÄ»
We're in the no one-night stand club together.

98
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,057
×ÖÄ»
Maybe Saturday night you and I could meet up

99
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:29,894
×ÖÄ»
and make our lunches for the week.

100
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:30,928
×ÖÄ»
Oh, God.

101
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,731
×ÖÄ»
Hey. Hi.

102
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:35,666
×ÖÄ»
Can I ask you some advice?

103
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,036
×ÖÄ»
About that thing that we were talking about earlier.

104
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,204
×ÖÄ»
Yes. Laser hair removal

105
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:41,705
×ÖÄ»
can be expensive, but then you won't have

106
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,507
×ÖÄ»
the shadow at least, which will help.

107
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:44,909
×ÖÄ»
No, I'm not talking about that.

108
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,544
×ÖÄ»
Oh, sorry.

109
00:03:46,578 --> 00:03:49,980
×ÖÄ»
I'm talking about how to help pick a guy for stuff.

110
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:51,882
×ÖÄ»
Oh. Well, the key, Mindy, is to find a man

111
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:53,417
×ÖÄ»
who you're attracted to... Okay.

112
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:55,686
×ÖÄ»
But you don't respect and you can't see a future with.

113
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,855
×ÖÄ»
Draco Malfoy.

114
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:01,091
×ÖÄ»
Someone not fictitious.

115
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,363
×ÖÄ»
Doctor.

116
00:04:06,398 --> 00:04:07,832
×ÖÄ»
Ugh.

117
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:10,668
×ÖÄ»
Let's examine that "Ugh" For a moment.

118
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:12,870
×ÖÄ»
It's actually a very fascinating emotion.

119
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,972
×ÖÄ»
It finds its roots in an evolutionary fear

120
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,006
×ÖÄ»
of contamination.

121
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,274
×ÖÄ»
It has very little to do with disgust.

122
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:18,342
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I get it, Brendan.

123
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:19,376
×ÖÄ»
You know a lot about science facts.

124
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:21,312
×ÖÄ»
Choose to ignore if you like.

125
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,089
×ÖÄ»
What are you doing?

126
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:35,492
×ÖÄ»
Brendan, um...

127
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:37,628
×ÖÄ»
Would you be interested

128
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:42,266
×ÖÄ»
in, um, me coming over...

129
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,435
×ÖÄ»
To your house...

130
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:46,537
×ÖÄ»
Tomorrow night...

131
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,439
×ÖÄ»
To hang out?

132
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:50,207
×ÖÄ»
I am so sorry.

133
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:51,242
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, okay. I take it back.

134
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:52,810
×ÖÄ»
Wait, what? That sounds fun.

135
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:55,412
×ÖÄ»
Let's do it. Just to be 100% clear,

136
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:56,914
×ÖÄ»
when I say "Hang out,"

137
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:59,817
×ÖÄ»
I mean, like--do you know what I'm talking about?

138
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:02,119
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, I get it. Whoa.

139
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:03,988
×ÖÄ»
We're gonna hang out.

140
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,281
×ÖÄ»
Guys, I am so nervous

141
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:11,382
×ÖÄ»
about seeing Brendan tonight.

142
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,650
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I love you having random hook-ups.

143
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,251
×ÖÄ»
I don't know. The last time

144
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:15,352
×ÖÄ»
she tried this was in college,

145
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:16,620
×ÖÄ»
and she got so freaked out

146
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,322
×ÖÄ»
that she pulled the fire alarm at the Hillel House.

147
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:20,658
×ÖÄ»
Gwen, first of all, Avi and I were sitting,

148
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:22,326
×ÖÄ»
looking at CDs in his CD binder.

149
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,161
×ÖÄ»
All of a sudden, he starts massaging my shoulders.

150
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:25,596
×ÖÄ»
I freaked out. If I can give you

151
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,630
×ÖÄ»
one piece of advice? Yeah.

152
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:28,098
×ÖÄ»
Don't wear underwear.

153
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,466
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I have never not worn underwear.

154
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:30,668
×ÖÄ»
I wear underwear under my bathing suits.

155
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:32,469
×ÖÄ»
Oh, and this will drive him crazy.

156
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:33,671
×ÖÄ»
Undress him.

157
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:34,972
×ÖÄ»
Like I'm his mom?

158
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:36,373
×ÖÄ»
Can't he undress himself?

159
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:37,508
×ÖÄ»
No, like he's a Christmas present

160
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:38,742
×ÖÄ»
that you just can't wait to unwrap.

161
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:39,944
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I can't believe I'm agreeing with this,

162
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,312
×ÖÄ»
but it is so true, because every time

163
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:42,546
×ÖÄ»
I start to unbutton Carl's shirt,

164
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:44,448
×ÖÄ»
that civil war book gets closed.

165
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:46,483
×ÖÄ»
All right, I can undress this guy.

166
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:48,419
×ÖÄ»
Whoa, whoa, whoa, why have we stopped doing crunches,

167
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,688
×ÖÄ»
you maggots? Hey, why is your nurse running our boot camp?

168
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,089
×ÖÄ»
'Cause he's dirt cheap.

169
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:53,824
×ÖÄ»
Hey, less questions, more crunches with your fat asses.

170
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:56,060
×ÖÄ»
What'd you say?

171
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:00,831
×ÖÄ»
Hi, I'm looking for Danny.

172
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:03,867
×ÖÄ»
Is he around? Oh, my God.

173
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:06,670
×ÖÄ»
Are you eye patch?

174
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:10,341
×ÖÄ»
I'm Jillian, but, yeah, I'm wearing an eye patch.

175
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,609
×ÖÄ»
It's nice to meet you. Hi, nice to meet you.

176
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:12,977
×ÖÄ»
I'm Mindy.

177
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:15,212
×ÖÄ»
Can I just say, even though you only have one eye,

178
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:16,847
×ÖÄ»
you are so pretty.

179
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:18,315
×ÖÄ»
I actually have two eyes.

180
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,018
×ÖÄ»
This one's just injured temporarily, but it'll be back.

181
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:22,953
×ÖÄ»
Hey, can you please tell me what Danny's apartment is like?

182
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:25,356
×ÖÄ»
In my mind, it's like a smoky speakeasy

183
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,224
×ÖÄ»
where old men go to complain about technology.

184
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:29,159
×ÖÄ»
But I could also see it being--

185
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:30,728
×ÖÄ»
Hey, I told you to go right into my office

186
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:32,496
×ÖÄ»
so you didn't have to stop in this outer area.

187
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,897
×ÖÄ»
Oh, no, come on.

188
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:35,366
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, but then we wouldn't be able to interact with her.

189
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,867
×ÖÄ»
Hi, I'm Morgan Tookers.

190
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:39,069
×ÖÄ»
Can I get a quick photo with you?

191
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:41,538
×ÖÄ»
Morgan, I don't want to have this talk again, okay?

192
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:43,807
×ÖÄ»
Danny, your girlfriend is so pretty.

193
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:45,576
×ÖÄ»
And she's much younger than you.

194
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,277
×ÖÄ»
She's not that much younger.

195
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:48,779
×ÖÄ»
She looks like she could be my daughter,

196
00:06:48,813 --> 00:06:51,582
×ÖÄ»
and I look like I could be your daughter.

197
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:52,916
×ÖÄ»
What are your plans tonight?

198
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:54,151
×ÖÄ»
We're heading out of here.

199
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:56,086
×ÖÄ»
We're gonna go see a play.

200
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:57,855
×ÖÄ»
Well, it's my friend's cabaret show.

201
00:06:57,889 --> 00:06:59,490
×ÖÄ»
What they do is they take these classic episodes

202
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:02,493
×ÖÄ»
of Golden Girls, and they recast all of the roles with guys.

203
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:03,961
×ÖÄ»
What? It's very sexual.

204
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:05,763
×ÖÄ»
There's a high, high chance of nudity.

205
00:07:05,797 --> 00:07:06,997
×ÖÄ»
I mean, aren't we gonna see a normal play,

206
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:10,034
×ÖÄ»
like Our Town or Death of a Salesman?

207
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:11,635
×ÖÄ»
Back in Otisville, I was in a production

208
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,870
×ÖÄ»
of Death of a Salesman.

209
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:14,004
×ÖÄ»
I played mom.

210
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,073
×ÖÄ»
Ironically, the guy who played happy

211
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:19,610
×ÖÄ»
hung himself in his cell.

212
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:21,545
×ÖÄ»
Did I use ironically correctly?

213
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,713
×ÖÄ»
Okay, we're gonna head out to dinner,

214
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:24,214
×ÖÄ»
so thanks, guys. Dinner.

215
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:25,883
×ÖÄ»
It's like 7:00. We're gonna eat after.

216
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:27,518
×ÖÄ»
I made a reservation for sushi at 11:00.

217
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:29,853
×ÖÄ»
00 at night? Wow, okay.

218
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:31,622
×ÖÄ»
When are we gonna go to bed?

219
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:33,057
×ÖÄ»
Eye patch, these plans

220
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:35,859
×ÖÄ»
sound just like the kind of in-your-face,

221
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:38,662
×ÖÄ»
campy, late-night cultural event that Danny loves.

222
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:39,997
×ÖÄ»
Have a great time, you guys.

223
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,065
×ÖÄ»
Okay. Thank you.

224
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,420
×ÖÄ»
It's really nice meeting you guys.

225
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:43,467
×ÖÄ»
Bye. See you. Take care.

226
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:47,771
×ÖÄ»
If you are watching this,

227
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:49,707
×ÖÄ»
I am already dead.

228
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:52,042
×ÖÄ»
I was murdered. Yeah.

229
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:54,578
×ÖÄ»
Just a innocent girl on her way

230
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:57,381
×ÖÄ»
to what she believed would be a harmless one-night stand.

231
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:58,916
×ÖÄ»
If you are a Lifetime executive,

232
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,851
×ÖÄ»
I would like to humbly offer up

233
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:03,487
×ÖÄ»
the following casting suggestions.

234
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:06,256
×ÖÄ»
For the part of me, Freida Pinto

235
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,025
×ÖÄ»
or a young Halle Berry.

236
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,593
×ÖÄ»
For the part of the cop

237
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:11,895
×ÖÄ»
who falls in love with me as he pieces together

238
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,032
×ÖÄ»
my life story, Mark Ruffalo.

239
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:16,567
×ÖÄ»
For my best friend...

240
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:31,882
×ÖÄ»
Not bad, huh? I--oh, no.

241
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,818
×ÖÄ»
Come in.

242
00:08:34,853 --> 00:08:36,520
×ÖÄ»
Okay, so we're just--

243
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:40,424
×ÖÄ»
we're just gonna dive right in then.

244
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,692
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

245
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:46,730
×ÖÄ»
â?â? 251 00:08: 00:08:48,999 So welcome.

246
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:51,235
×ÖÄ»
You have a sweater on. Okay. Cool.

247
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:53,170
×ÖÄ»
You look very nice.

248
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:55,272
×ÖÄ»
Thank you.

249
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:58,842
×ÖÄ»
I've got some bad news.

250
00:08:58,877 --> 00:09:01,278
×ÖÄ»
The theater doesn't have any heat right now.

251
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:02,513
×ÖÄ»
It's 30 degrees out.

252
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:04,014
×ÖÄ»
How long is the show?

253
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:05,682
×ÖÄ»
It's like a really loose structure,

254
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:07,518
×ÖÄ»
and there's a lot of audience participation.

255
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:08,819
×ÖÄ»
And, at any second,

256
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:10,821
×ÖÄ»
one of the actors could just, like, pluck you out

257
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:12,756
×ÖÄ»
from the audience and onto the stage

258
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,258
×ÖÄ»
and in the scene. They just pluck you, yeah.

259
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,326
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, yeah, and you just go with it.

260
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,061
×ÖÄ»
It would be fun... Yeah.

261
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:20,464
×ÖÄ»
Yeah. If I was up there.

262
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,592
×ÖÄ»
Oh, man, they need me at the hospital.

263
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:29,160
×ÖÄ»
Oh, no. Is everything okay?

264
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,829
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I should probably-- I'm so sorry.

265
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:31,830
×ÖÄ»
I should get outta here.

266
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:32,831
×ÖÄ»
Okay. You're cool?

267
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,733
×ÖÄ»
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay.

268
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,301
×ÖÄ»
I'm so bummed!

269
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:37,575
×ÖÄ»
Can I get you a drink?

270
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:39,871
×ÖÄ»
Vodka. Vodka and what?

271
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:41,840
×ÖÄ»
Nothing. Just, like, in a Dixie cup.

272
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,074
×ÖÄ»
That's fine.

273
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:44,743
×ÖÄ»
If you do have some corn chips,

274
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:48,012
×ÖÄ»
I find that those go very well with the vodka.

275
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,180
×ÖÄ»
I don't believe in snacking.

276
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,850
×ÖÄ»
Anyhow, how was your day?

277
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,219
×ÖÄ»
It's getting better now.

278
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:56,221
×ÖÄ»
Mm. How was your day?

279
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:57,655
×ÖÄ»
Paperwork in the morning,

280
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,224
×ÖÄ»
had some new consultations midday.

281
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:03,328
×ÖÄ»
Then I wrote a scathing anti-epidural op-ed

282
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,763
×ÖÄ»
for the Detroit Free Press.

283
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:06,131
×ÖÄ»
What?

284
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:07,599
×ÖÄ»
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

285
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:08,933
×ÖÄ»
Are you kidding me?

286
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:10,902
×ÖÄ»
Epidurals prevent so much senseless suffering.

287
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:12,404
×ÖÄ»
You know what?

288
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:13,471
×ÖÄ»
Doesn't matter.

289
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:14,806
×ÖÄ»
We're not here to talk about medicine.

290
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,942
×ÖÄ»
We're here to talk chemistry.

291
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:19,744
×ÖÄ»
And biology.

292
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:21,212
×ÖÄ»
And urology.

293
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:24,115
×ÖÄ»
What?

294
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,118
×ÖÄ»
Do you have a place that I could just freshen up?

295
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:33,158
×ÖÄ»
All right, what's in your medicine cabinet,

296
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:36,428
×ÖÄ»
you little weirdo reefer hippie?

297
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:37,462
×ÖÄ»
Oh, God.

298
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:39,631

314
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:31,916
×ÖÄ»
â?But time makes you bolder â? 327 00:11: 00:11:41,359 Brendan!

315
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:43,941
×ÖÄ»
â?The landslide will bring it down â? 329 00:11: 00:11:47,699

316
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:46,030
×ÖÄ»
â?â? 330 00:11: 00:11:54,306 Hey, you. Hey, there.

317
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,041
×ÖÄ»
Don't move.

318
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:00,746
×ÖÄ»
Hi.

319
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,014
×ÖÄ»
Hey.

320
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:03,181
×ÖÄ»
Make yourself comfortable.

321
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:04,950
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

322
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:06,818
×ÖÄ»
I'm really psyched to start hooking up with you.

323
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:08,927
×ÖÄ»
Yeah. Oh, you know...

324
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:10,422
×ÖÄ»
Remember kama sutra?

325
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:11,456
×ÖÄ»
Mm-hmm.

326
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,425
×ÖÄ»
Oh, oh, take it easy.

327
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:14,927
×ÖÄ»
Slow to go fast, right?

328
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:17,246
×ÖÄ»
Cool. Why don't I undress you?

329
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:18,555
×ÖÄ»
Cool. Yeah.

330
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:20,165
×ÖÄ»
You're gonna like it. Okay.

331
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,800
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

332
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,742
×ÖÄ»
Okay. This is harder than I thought.

333
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:28,355
×ÖÄ»
Do you need help? No.

334
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,356
×ÖÄ»
You sure? Yeah.

335
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,824
×ÖÄ»
Okay. Um...

336
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:32,559
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, I'll come-- Just let me. Yeah.

337
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:34,561
×ÖÄ»
Thank you. Okay, there.

338
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:36,363
×ÖÄ»
Can you bend your arm, please?

339
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:37,498
×ÖÄ»
Just be careful with the seam. Just go slack.

340
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:39,066
×ÖÄ»
I'm slack. Your head is crazy big.

341
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,434
×ÖÄ»
Ow! Ow! Here we go.

342
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,835
×ÖÄ»
Wow, my eye.

343
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,936
×ÖÄ»
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

344
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:43,937
×ÖÄ»
You knocked out my contact.

345
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,339
×ÖÄ»
What does it look like?

346
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:47,775
×ÖÄ»
My contact? It's a clear, round disc.

347
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,145
×ÖÄ»
Okay. You don't have to take that kind of tone.

348
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:52,146
×ÖÄ»
I'm just trying to help.

349
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,580
×ÖÄ»
Okay. Here. Just scoot over.

350
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:54,982
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry.

351
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:57,351
×ÖÄ»
I thought it would be sexy to undress you.

352
00:12:57,385 --> 00:13:01,422
×ÖÄ»
You know what, contacts are disposable.

353
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:04,024
×ÖÄ»
This night is not.

354
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:05,993
×ÖÄ»
Oh, God. Are you serious?

355
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:07,227
×ÖÄ»
Did you just really say that?

356
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:08,729
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

357
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:10,330
×ÖÄ»
Let me do this.

358
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:14,902
×ÖÄ»
â?â? 374 00:13: 00:13:16,203 Hey, Brendan.

359
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:18,272
×ÖÄ»
Oh, hey, Duncan. We have a guest.

360
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:20,107
×ÖÄ»
We share this space. It's okay.

361
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:21,408
×ÖÄ»
Okay--

362
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:23,410
×ÖÄ»
I brought a friend to hang out with too.

363
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:25,012
×ÖÄ»
Whoa, nice place.

364
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:27,448
×ÖÄ»
Oh, my God.

365
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:28,582
×ÖÄ»
Dr. L?

366
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:29,950
×ÖÄ»
Morgan, what are you doing here?

367
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:31,618
×ÖÄ»
Funny story.

368
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,387
×ÖÄ»
This is not what it looks like.

369
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:35,222
×ÖÄ»
We are just hanging out.

370
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,356
×ÖÄ»
That's exactly what it looks like.

371
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:37,491
×ÖÄ»
You cannot tell Dr. Castellano.

372
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,592
×ÖÄ»
It was not supposed to happen. No problem.

373
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:39,906
×ÖÄ»
That's fine. Hey, what's up, man?

374
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:41,028
×ÖÄ»
How are you? Hey, good to see you.

375
00:13:41,062 --> 00:13:42,763
×ÖÄ»
Don't-- We were accidental friends.

376
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:43,864
×ÖÄ»
Can you get off--

377
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:45,099
×ÖÄ»
It's out there now, and I need you

378
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,133
×ÖÄ»
to accept that.

379
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,367
×ÖÄ»
Tell me you get it.

380
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:48,368
×ÖÄ»
I get it.

381
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:50,704
×ÖÄ»
Whew.

382
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:53,073
×ÖÄ»
How long's this little bromance been going on?

383
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:54,608
×ÖÄ»
We're not bros, Morgan.

384
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:57,744
×ÖÄ»
We were actually about to become intimate.

385
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,280
×ÖÄ»
Ooh, Dr. Lahiri!

386
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:02,549
×ÖÄ»
You little knucklehead. Stop it.

387
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:03,851
×ÖÄ»
Stop tickling me.

388
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,153
×ÖÄ»
When were you gonna tell me you had a boyfriend?

389
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:07,588
×ÖÄ»
I don't have a boyfriend. Can I be the best man at the wedding?

390
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:08,922
×ÖÄ»
No, Morgan, we're not-- Don't answer now,

391
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:10,057
×ÖÄ»
but know that it's something I really want.

392
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:11,125
×ÖÄ»
This isn't even a date.

393
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,594
×ÖÄ»
Do you understand what I'm saying?

394
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:20,000
×ÖÄ»
Is this a casual sexual encounter?

395
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:21,802
×ÖÄ»
Yes. Nope!

396
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:23,303
×ÖÄ»
Excuse me. Nope.

397
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:24,938
×ÖÄ»
What are you doing?

398
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:26,840
×ÖÄ»
I'm talking to my friend in private.

399
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,675
×ÖÄ»
Why don't you and Duncan go to the arcade

400
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,577
×ÖÄ»
or something? The arcade is closed for rats.

401
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:32,146
×ÖÄ»
Morgan! It's not right.

402
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,547
×ÖÄ»
Yes, okay, it might be a bad idea,

403
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,282
×ÖÄ»
but sometimes you need to experience

404
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:37,017
×ÖÄ»
the outcome of a bad idea.

405
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:38,519
×ÖÄ»
Like you and train tracks.

406
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:41,655
×ÖÄ»
I know it's wrong, but I gotta have those smushed pennies.

407
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:43,357
×ÖÄ»
Yes, and now I need some smushed pennies.

408
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,025
×ÖÄ»
Look, I won't tell anyone about your Deslaurier

409
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:46,827
×ÖÄ»
if you don't tell anyone about my Deslaurier.

410
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:48,595
×ÖÄ»
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Your secret is safe with me.

411
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,897
×ÖÄ»
Largely because I don't care,

412
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,931
×ÖÄ»
and I'll probably forget.

413
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,899
×ÖÄ»
Thank you so much. Okay.

414
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,135
×ÖÄ»
You guys, I am so scared right now.

415
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,639
×ÖÄ»
Little girl, do not open that email--oh, my God.

416
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:01,041
×ÖÄ»
Oh, nice, candy straws. Thanks, doc.

417
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:02,509
×ÖÄ»
Hey, Duncan, you sure you want to eat that, buddy?

418
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:04,545
×ÖÄ»
Why can't he eat the sour straws?

419
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:05,979
×ÖÄ»
They're delicious. What are they, poison?

420
00:15:06,014 --> 00:15:07,381
×ÖÄ»
It's made of corn syrup,

421
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:09,716
×ÖÄ»
so I'd say, yes, that's government-subsidized poison.

422
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:11,218
×ÖÄ»
It's really good.

423
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,519
×ÖÄ»
Okay, if you open the email, you die.

424
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:14,955
×ÖÄ»
I was raised eating corn syrup,

425
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:17,090
×ÖÄ»
and I think I turned out okay.

426
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,659
×ÖÄ»
But your children will pay for that.

427
00:15:18,693 --> 00:15:21,428
×ÖÄ»
You don't need to worry about my unborn children, weirdo.

428
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,896
×ÖÄ»
You know what, I'm gonna go, all right?

429
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:24,631
×ÖÄ»
You have a weird, lame shower,

430
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,300
×ÖÄ»
this movie sucks, and this conversation--

431
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,634
×ÖÄ»
I've gained nothing from it.

432
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:28,702
×ÖÄ»
Mm.

433
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:29,703
×ÖÄ»
Hey. Wait. Wait.

434
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:31,004
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

435
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,706
×ÖÄ»
Please take these out of my house.

436
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,441
×ÖÄ»
Aoki, Aoki, don't open it.

437
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,443
×ÖÄ»
Don't open the email. Don't open the email.

438
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,747
×ÖÄ»
Oh, God!

439
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:45,819
×ÖÄ»
Asthma attack.

440
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:47,154
×ÖÄ»
Guys. Oh, my God.

441
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:49,122
×ÖÄ»
Okay, Morgan, Morgan, where's your inhaler?

442
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,958
×ÖÄ»
Where's your inhaler? It's in my duffel.

443
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,427
×ÖÄ»
God, Morgan, why do you have a mannequin head

444
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,628
×ÖÄ»
and Bossypants in here?

445
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,031
×ÖÄ»
I wanted to see how Tina Fey can juggle it all.

446
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:59,399
×ÖÄ»
Okay, okay, here, here. Take it.

447
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:01,394
×ÖÄ»
Take it, take it, take it. Oh, God, give it to me.

448
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:05,706
×ÖÄ»
It's empty. It's empty.

449
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,044
×ÖÄ»
Oh, my God.

450
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:10,864
×ÖÄ»
He needs to calm down.

451
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:12,633
×ÖÄ»
There is a strong link between panic

452
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:13,800
×ÖÄ»
and asthma, okay?

453
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:15,369
×ÖÄ»
You can't just wave a dream catcher

454
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:16,937
×ÖÄ»
at a respiratory condition, Brendan.

455
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:18,805
×ÖÄ»
Let me handle this. Okay?

456
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,440
×ÖÄ»
Morgan, listen to me,

457
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:23,143
×ÖÄ»
I need you to envision the most relaxing place

458
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:24,144
×ÖÄ»
in the whole world.

459
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:25,345
×ÖÄ»
What is that?

460
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,813
×ÖÄ»
The quarry. What?

461
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:28,248
×ÖÄ»
The quarry. Good, the quarry. The quarry.

462
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:29,349
×ÖÄ»
Describe the quarry.

463
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:31,418
×ÖÄ»
It's nice. It's got a lot of rocks.

464
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:33,720
×ÖÄ»
A lot of lowlifes. Not lowlifes. They're friends.

465
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:35,155
×ÖÄ»
Well, they shouldn't be, Morgan. No judging.

466
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:36,924
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I just--I know him better than you, okay?

467
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,193
×ÖÄ»
Morgan, picture that you're in a beautiful ocean

468
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:42,763
×ÖÄ»
and you're going for a nice, calming swim.

469
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:44,097
×ÖÄ»
Oh, look, it's-- Denise Richards

470
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:45,866
×ÖÄ»
comes up to you, and she's wearing a skimpy bikini.

471
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,434
×ÖÄ»
What if she doesn't like my body?

472
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:48,902
×ÖÄ»
What if it's a hidden camera show?

473
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:50,704
×ÖÄ»
I have handles.

474
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:52,072
×ÖÄ»
I have love handles. Forget the beach.

475
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:53,440
×ÖÄ»
Back to the quarry.

476
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:55,208
×ÖÄ»
You're surrounded by rock formations

477
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:57,377
×ÖÄ»
that have existed since the dawn of time.

478
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:58,545
×ÖÄ»
Pre-dawn of time.

479
00:16:58,579 --> 00:16:59,746
×ÖÄ»
There's no such thing as pre-dawn of time.

480
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:01,114
×ÖÄ»
The night before the dawn of time.

481
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:02,516
×ÖÄ»
The beginning is the beginning. There's no before.

482
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,784
×ÖÄ»
Just please stop it, okay?

483
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:05,686
×ÖÄ»
Now these rocks are gonna start to snuggle you,

484
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,621
×ÖÄ»
and you're starting to feel safe.

485
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:09,589
×ÖÄ»
Hugged by rocks.

486
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:10,724
×ÖÄ»
I feel safe.

487
00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:12,225
×ÖÄ»
Okay, now give me your hand.

488
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,796
×ÖÄ»
We're gonna take a nice, smooth, cool stone.

489
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,931
×ÖÄ»
I don't know-- the bonsai tree right there.

490
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:19,232
×ÖÄ»
Give me a stone. How was I supposed to glean that?

491
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:21,435
×ÖÄ»
We're gonna place the stone in your hand

492
00:17:21,469 --> 00:17:23,103
×ÖÄ»
and say, "I'll always have the quarry with me."

493
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:24,438
×ÖÄ»
I'll always have the quarry with me.

494
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:26,807
×ÖÄ»
So I can breathe. Breathe...

495
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:29,776
×ÖÄ»
Respira... Respira...

496
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:36,817
×ÖÄ»
Whoa.

497
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:38,118
×ÖÄ»
Are you kidding me?

498
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:39,953
×ÖÄ»
He had it in his-- I mean, I got it.

499
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:42,155
×ÖÄ»
Duncan, I'm okay, man.

500
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,623
×ÖÄ»
Morgan, I'm gonna take you to the hospital...

501
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:45,158
×ÖÄ»
Yeah. So you can get looked at.

502
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:46,626
×ÖÄ»
You can go to the hospital. It's completely unnecessary.

503
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:48,095
×ÖÄ»
He's fine. Oh.

504
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:49,429
×ÖÄ»
He's fine. Doc, real quick.

505
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:52,733
×ÖÄ»
Yeah. This man just saved my life

506
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,002
×ÖÄ»
and did the best magic I've ever seen.

507
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:57,004
×ÖÄ»
So, if you want me to look the other way while you do him,

508
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,040
×ÖÄ»
I can wait.

509
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:01,541
×ÖÄ»
You want to do that?

510
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:02,843
×ÖÄ»
Let's go.

511
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:04,578
×ÖÄ»
Seven, reverse,

512
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:06,246
×ÖÄ»
skip, skip,

513
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,515
×ÖÄ»
blue, wild card, red, uno, what?

514
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:09,583
×ÖÄ»
Are you kidding me?

515
00:18:09,617 --> 00:18:10,917
×ÖÄ»
I didn't even get to go.

516
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:12,452
×ÖÄ»
Dr. L, these two cool guys

517
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:14,521
×ÖÄ»
spent the night together, just like we did.

518
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:16,390
×ÖÄ»
Mindy, was your tryst with Morgan?

519
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:17,624
×ÖÄ»
What? No.

520
00:18:17,658 --> 00:18:19,593
×ÖÄ»
Guys, I tried to have a hook-up tonight,

521
00:18:19,627 --> 00:18:20,660
×ÖÄ»
and it went horribly.

522
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,429
×ÖÄ»
Maybe it'll be better next time.

523
00:18:22,463 --> 00:18:24,631
×ÖÄ»
I don't think so. I tried for a guy

524
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:26,066
×ÖÄ»
that I don't respect. Guess what, guys.

525
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,968
×ÖÄ»
No sex, and now I respect him.

526
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:29,703
×ÖÄ»
See, I told you you got attached.

527
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:30,871
×ÖÄ»
Yes, Danny, you were right.

528
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:32,973
×ÖÄ»
My only consolation is that you are here.

529
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:35,509
×ÖÄ»
So it means that your evening went as badly as mine.

530
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:36,676
×ÖÄ»
Hey.

531
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:38,979
×ÖÄ»
Hey. Damn it.

532
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,381
×ÖÄ»
Eye patch, you look prettier now than you did before.

533
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,183
×ÖÄ»
Thank you.

534
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:44,918
×ÖÄ»
Out of curiosity, do the four of you know

535
00:18:44,952 --> 00:18:46,686
×ÖÄ»
how terrible it smells in this doctors' lounge,

536
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:47,821
×ÖÄ»
or are you used to it?

537
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:48,822
×ÖÄ»
We're used to it. Used to it.

538
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:49,823
×ÖÄ»
I don't think it smells bad.

539
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:50,991
×ÖÄ»
Dr. Jeremy Reed.

540
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,426
×ÖÄ»
Pleasure to meet you, miss patch.

541
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,261
×ÖÄ»
You know, your eye patch gets all the attention,

542
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:55,729
×ÖÄ»
but I think your nose is rather noteworthy.

543
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:57,964
×ÖÄ»
Should you and Danny find your differences--

544
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,666
×ÖÄ»
Okay, buddy, thanks.

545
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,667
×ÖÄ»
Time to go. Okay.

546
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:02,002
×ÖÄ»
Hey. Hey.

547
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:05,472
×ÖÄ»
So, I don't know, I just have this feeling

548
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:07,474
×ÖÄ»
like maybe you left and came here

549
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:09,643
×ÖÄ»
because you didn't really like our plans tonight.

550
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:11,845
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry. I just think

551
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:14,915
×ÖÄ»
we're into different things, and...

552
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:16,550
×ÖÄ»
Am I too old for you?

553
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:18,518
×ÖÄ»
I don't think so. I like that you're 32.

554
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,654
×ÖÄ»
38. Are you serious, dude?

555
00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:22,556
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

556
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,193
×ÖÄ»
What?

557
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:27,561
×ÖÄ»
I'm just trying to figure out

558
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:30,063
×ÖÄ»
how many Olympics you've been around for.

559
00:19:30,098 --> 00:19:32,199
×ÖÄ»
Were you alive for Berlin?

560
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:34,901
×ÖÄ»
In 1936?

561
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,443
×ÖÄ»
Morgan! I'm sorry.

562
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:44,711
×ÖÄ»
That just means he likes you.

563
00:19:47,381 --> 00:19:49,816
×ÖÄ»
Can you hold the door, please?

564
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:57,691
×ÖÄ»
â?â? 586 00:19: 00:20:03,296 Okay, this is massively awkward,

565
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:05,565
×ÖÄ»
so I am just going to start saying things.

566
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:08,086
×ÖÄ»
Brendan, I was not able to have

567
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,323
×ÖÄ»
a casual hook-up with you. That's fine.

568
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:13,992
×ÖÄ»
In other countries, that is not embarrassing.

569
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:14,993
×ÖÄ»
It is actually a virtue.

570
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:16,129
×ÖÄ»
Maybe not for you

571
00:20:16,364 --> 00:20:18,630
×ÖÄ»
and whatever weird commune that you were raised in,

572
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:20,832
×ÖÄ»
but I'm pretty sure that internationally

573
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:21,833
×ÖÄ»
I have the upper hand.

574
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:23,902
×ÖÄ»
It is rude to not have snacks

575
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:25,537
×ÖÄ»
at your house when someone's coming over.

576
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:27,507
×ÖÄ»
All right? Pretzels, chips, some soda--

577
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:28,400
×ÖÄ»
how hard is that?

578
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,976
×ÖÄ»
And your guitar playing, while technically proficient,

579
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,445
×ÖÄ»
lacks depth.

580
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:36,615
×ÖÄ»
There is a small knife at your house.

581
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:38,070
×ÖÄ»
I brought it with me

582
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,719
×ÖÄ»
to stab you with it in case you tried to attack me.

583
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,988
×ÖÄ»
It is hidden discreetly in a woman's glove.

584
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:45,012
×ÖÄ»
I would hate for Duncan to hurt himself.

585
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:47,359
×ÖÄ»
I did not however thank you

586
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,861
×ÖÄ»
for helping my friend. So thank you.

587
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:51,496
×ÖÄ»
You're welcome.

588
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:54,499
×ÖÄ»
So good day to you.

589
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:00,939
×ÖÄ»
We are going to have sex.

590
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:03,308
×ÖÄ»
Just so you know.

591
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:08,547
×ÖÄ»
Not now... in an elevator.

592
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:11,449
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, of course.

593
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:12,918
×ÖÄ»
Your floor. Yeah, okay.

594
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:14,319
×ÖÄ»
Thank you.

595
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:27,933
