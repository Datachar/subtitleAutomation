1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,343
Well, you're right, Maw Maw.

2
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:06,647
The old gray mare--
she ain't what she used to be.

3
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:08,565
You're not gonna believe
what I just saw.

4
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:09,983
I just watched
an 86-year-old woman

5
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:11,568
give herself a Brazilian wax.

6
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,153
Try me.

7
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:15,455
I'm mowing the Andersons' yard
and I hear this commotion.

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,658
I look over the bushes, into the park,

9
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:21,328
and I saw him forcing
his way on top of her.

10
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:23,013
Oh, my God, Burt.

11
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:24,864
It was horrible; she was
fighting to get away.

12
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:25,799
What did you do?

13
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,050
I shouted, "Get off of her!"

14
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:29,202
He looked up at me with
that caught look in his eye.

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,954
He took off running.

16
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:32,139
Was she okay?

17
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:34,591
I don't know. She scurried
up a tree and was gone.

18
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,695
Burt... are we talking
about a human?

19
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,896
Squirrel.
Damn it,

20
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:42,399
Burt, if you're going to come
home with these stories,

21
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:43,850
you have to lead with the species,

22
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:45,218
so I know if I should care or not.

23
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:47,220
Well, that's easy for you to say.

24
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:48,405
You're not on the front lines

25
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,190
of Mother Nature's twisted playground.

26
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,325
I'm faced with squirrel rapists,

27
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,894
birds ripping innocent
worms from their homes,

28
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:57,414
and I saw that whole
family get electrocuted.

29
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,666
They were moths.

30
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:00,900
I bet you'd be crying your eyes out

31
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:03,286
if it was a family of butterflies.

32
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:06,423
A moth is just
an ugly butterfly, Virginia.

33
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,091
Racist.

34
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:11,027
<i>Whoo!</i>

35
00:01:11,147 --> 00:01:18,399
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

36
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,754
(in low voice): Do not get
out of that bed, Hope.

37
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:22,422
You hear how low my voice is?

38
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,441
That means I'm serious.

39
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:29,929
Good parenting, Jimmy.

40
00:01:29,947 --> 00:01:31,264
Kids will do anything if you just say it

41
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:32,966
low enough.
(in low voice): Run to the store.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,950
We need some more beer.

43
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:35,235
(in low voice):
And take 45 minutes.

44
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,770
Your father and I are feeling frisky.

45
00:01:36,788 --> 00:01:38,288
30 minutes should be fine.

46
00:01:38,322 --> 00:01:42,375
Okay, I know it's stupid, but
I have tried everything else.

47
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,778
Okay, Sabrina's here.

48
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:47,798
I will start the intervention,
but you two promised to help.

49
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,950
Hey, guys.

50
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:52,636
Enough talk-- it's time
for you to listen.

51
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,953
Now sit down.

52
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:56,306
You're up, Jimmy.

53
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,142
Okay.

54
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:04,397
You know I love you, and
as difficult as this may be,

55
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:07,400
I think it's time
that we have an honest,

56
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:09,302
heart-to-heart talk
about something

57
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,222
that we all feel is becoming a problem.

58
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:14,074
Okay, yes, sometimes I eat dirt.

59
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:16,243
So what? Einstein
ate dirt-- Einstein.

60
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:20,947
This wasn't about the dirt, was it?

61
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:23,983
Is this about me mentally
counting the number of words

62
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,168
I say in every sentence?
13.

63
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:26,319
You know what?

64
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:28,088
Burt was right;
I should just listen, okay.

65
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:30,957
We feel you--
once in a while, but not often,

66
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:35,095
yet more than we'd like,
but sometimes...

67
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,980
Don't pull your weight when
it comes to taking care of Hope.

68
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:39,015
Sorry, Jimmy, but the baby
would have been a grown-up

69
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,684
by the time you finished that sentence.

70
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:42,169
I do lots of stuff with Hope.

71
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,639
Yeah, but you only do the fun stuff.

72
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:53,263
I thought you were taking her
to the dentist.

73
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,365
Oh, did you say "dentist"?

74
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,734
Because we both thought
you said "play in the mud."

75
00:02:57,768 --> 00:03:00,186
I'm gonna grab some towels
and we can clean her up.

76
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:13,834
W-Where have you been?

77
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:14,918
We sent you out for socks.

78
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:16,503
We're late for the church pageant.

79
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,371
We went to the carnival.

80
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,457
Show her what we won.

81
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,042
You're gonna need to buy a
filter and a tank for that

82
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,144
within the next three hours.

83
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:25,312
Bye, Hope.

84
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:26,513
Bye, Mr. Swimmy-pants.

85
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:29,766
Hair, gum.

86
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:32,402
Bummer.

87
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,224
Okay, you're right.
I do avoid the tough stuff.

88
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:40,744
It's okay.
You can change.

89
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:42,229
What if it's hereditary?

90
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,232
What if I just don't
have the parenting gene?

91
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,850
Okay, it's called geophagy.

92
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:49,035
I sense you have questions.
Go ahead.

93
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,171
(sighs) Do you have to wash
your hands before you eat dirt?

94
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:53,039
If it falls on the ground,
is there a five-second rule?

95
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:54,341
Have you ever tried sand?

96
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,709
Is Mexican dirt spicy?

97
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:58,011
If you swallow an apple seed,
will you poop a tree?

98
00:03:58,045 --> 00:04:00,046
Oh, she's up again.

99
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:02,883
Oh, it's the fifth time.

100
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:08,972
(in low voice):
Hope, you have to go to bed.

101
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:10,089
No.

102
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:11,524
I don't know what to do.

103
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,810
My voice doesn't go any lower than this.

104
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:16,079
You want to find out if you
have the parenting gene?

105
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:17,347
Why don't you spend the next two hours

106
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:18,999
trying to keep her in that bed?

107
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:19,983
(sighs)

108
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:21,100
Okay, I can do this.

109
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:23,119
Okay.

110
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:26,456
Hope,

111
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,791
it's bedtime.

112
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,659
I want you to go into your room

113
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:31,544
and I want you to get in your bed

114
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,613
and I don't want you
to come out until morning.

115
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,465
Okay?
Okay.

116
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:41,120
(chuckles)

117
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:43,924
I'm gonna be good at this.

118
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,795
It's killing you, isn't it?

119
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:50,096
Of course.

120
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,482
I'm a landscaper.
I'm surrounded by dirt.

121
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:55,819
What if I've been wasting
money on food my whole life?

122
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:57,187
Did you see that?

123
00:04:57,238 --> 00:04:58,488
Hope went into the bedroom.

124
00:04:58,522 --> 00:05:00,240
She's never done that for me.

125
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:02,141
Look, don't beat yourself up about it.

126
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:03,610
You're like a Mr. Mom.

127
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:04,995
Maybe Hope sees Sabrina

128
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:07,664
as the Mrs. Dad, you know,
the one who lays down the law.

129
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:11,618
There are tons of sensitive,
nurturing fathers

130
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:13,319
raising kids all over America

131
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:14,587
and on almost every TV show--

132
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:15,588
except for Tim Allen.

133
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:17,657
He's all man.

134
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:18,875
Ooh-ooh-ooh.

135
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:21,995
Anyway, my point is,
Hope will be proud of you

136
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:24,514
no matter what you are,
just the same way

137
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:25,665
you're proud of your dad.

138
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:27,166
Ugh!

139
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:28,802
Nope, nope.

140
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:31,425
I'm still gonna need to pack a lunch.

141
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:34,607
♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...

142
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:37,844
(humming along)

143
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,535
Hey, hey, hey!

144
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:46,987
(blowing whistle)

145
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:49,823
VIRGINIA:
Burt.

146
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:51,791
I saw him.

147
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:52,993
I saw the squirrel.

148
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:55,194
Beady little eyes, fluffy white tail?

149
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:56,746
Yes, he's a monster.

150
00:05:56,797 --> 00:05:58,381
Right there in broad daylight.

151
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,883
He saw me watching,

152
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,367
and I think he liked it.

153
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:02,886
That little pervert has no shame.

154
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,370
We got to do something about this.

155
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:06,372
If we don't help the victims, who will?

156
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,042
The possums, the groundhogs?

157
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,727
They're afraid of their own shadow.

158
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,979
Humans are the smartest
in the animal kingdom,

159
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:14,647
except possibly the dolphins,

160
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:17,717
but those arrogant bastards
aren't gonna do a damn thing.

161
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:19,019
So what are we gonna do?

162
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:20,770
We are going to make it
our life's mission

163
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:22,572
to catch that squirrel and put an end

164
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:25,484
to his rampage of unwelcome humping.

165
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:27,586
This might be the most
important thing we ever do.

166
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,261
Hey, you guys don't see me
as a Mr. Mom, do you?

167
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:39,458
FRANK:
Not me.

168
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:42,643
I just think of you as a guy
who's obsessed with his kid--

169
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:44,362
driving her all around,

170
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:46,430
making sure her tights match her outfit.

171
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:48,965
That's exactly
what a Mr. Mom does.

172
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:52,135
Oh, then, you are getting
a mug on Mr. Mother's Day.

173
00:06:52,153 --> 00:06:54,438
You know, I must concur with Frank.

174
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:55,906
The James we all know has a tender heart

175
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,307
and a gentler touch,

176
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:59,693
which is why I always have
you stack the avocados.

177
00:06:59,744 --> 00:07:01,328
So what?

178
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:04,414
You're a maternal guy
with beautiful, soft hands.

179
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,033
There are worse things you could be.

180
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:07,784
True, I could be a dirt-eater.

181
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:10,153
Einstein ate dirt-- Einstein.

182
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:13,624
You know, I can sympathize
with you, James.

183
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:14,958
Being raised by two moms,

184
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:16,960
I wasn't always the strong
masculine authority figure

185
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:18,211
I am today.

186
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:20,097
What helped me tap
into my rough-and-tumble

187
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:21,882
was becoming an auxiliary policeman.

188
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,333
That's why they call me

189
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:25,001
Badass Barney around here.

190
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:27,971
No, it's 'cause you have
an unattractive rear end.

191
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:29,439
It's both reasons.

192
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:31,341
Listen, James, I'm going

193
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,026
to be on patrol all weekend.

194
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:34,344
You should come with me.

195
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:35,612
Oh, that would be amazing,

196
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,114
but I can't.
I got to take care

197
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:38,649
of Hope all weekend.

198
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:39,900
No, Jimmy, you should go.

199
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:41,685
Get your rough-and-tumble on
with Barney.

200
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:43,186
I could watch Hope till Monday.

201
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:44,854
Are you sure?
Yeah, of course.

202
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:46,456
My God, that would be great.

203
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,458
I have a uniform you can
borrow. N-Now, of course,

204
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:49,793
I can't let you borrow
my achievement star,

205
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,795
but I can show you how I made it.

206
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:53,463
You're welcome to tag along, too, Frank.

207
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:54,881
There gonna be a lot of marching,

208
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,133
hanging out with dudes?

209
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,567
Not really.

210
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,635
Pass.

211
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:06,343
Yeah, little creep's up there

212
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:08,095
just wagging his big white tail,

213
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:10,213
not a care in the world.

214
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:11,598
Are you sure these pellets

215
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:12,933
won't hurt the other squirrels?

216
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:14,151
They're perfectly safe.

217
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:15,652
I use these pellets to relocate gophers

218
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:16,653
all the time.

219
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:17,854
The little black pellets

220
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:19,556
put the gophers to sleep
so they don't suffer

221
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:21,108
when the little white pellets kill 'em,

222
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,492
but, see,

223
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,327
I always take
the little white pellets out.

224
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:26,863
So the gophers just go to sleep?
Yeah.

225
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:29,332
How can you be sure you haven't
accidentally killed one?

226
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,400
I've been trapping and relocating

227
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:31,752
the same gophers for years.

228
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:33,587
They summer at the Millers'
and winter at the golf course.

229
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:34,921
Crafty.

230
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:36,239
How many gophers?

231
00:08:36,257 --> 00:08:39,493
Five-- Jackie, Tito, Marlon,
Jermaine, and Michael.

232
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:41,011
(chuckles) Once,
when they were knocked out,

233
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:42,579
I put a little glove on Michael.

234
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:44,014
You should have seen him dancing around,

235
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:45,716
trying to shake it off.

236
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,717
(laughs)

237
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,051
I'm remembering it now.

238
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:50,887
(laughing):
That's hilarious.

239
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,889
I'm sorry you're missing this.
Me, too.

240
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:54,524
I'm surprised they haven't
come up with something

241
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,859
that you can plug into both our heads

242
00:08:55,893 --> 00:08:57,427
so we can see each other's memories.

243
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:59,646
You know, I bet they will.

244
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:01,531
I bet they will.

245
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:02,699
(laughs)

246
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:05,068
What's he doing now?
He's still just dancing around.

247
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:07,487
(snickering)

248
00:09:07,538 --> 00:09:09,523
(mumbles)

249
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:15,378
Ha-ha.

250
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:17,914
Anyone else smell pig?

251
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:18,915
You know, I'm surprised

252
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,383
that thing fits you.

253
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:22,452
Wasn't that Barney's uniform
from when he was fat?

254
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,288
I look better coming than going.

255
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:26,757
Oh.

256
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:29,559
You and I

257
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:32,429
are going to have
so much fun this weekend.

258
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:33,930
(whispering): You want
to go steal some candy

259
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,816
while the fake cops are distracted?

260
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,735
(grunts)

261
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,570
BARNEY:
Well, James,

262
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:43,573
are you ready to clean up the
mean streets of Natesville?

263
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:46,643
I just hope you don't come
across any criminal mastermind

264
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:48,978
who figures out how to do this.

265
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:52,582
Uncool, Frank.

266
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:53,983
Don't worry, James.

267
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:56,152
A good auxiliary policeman
always carries safety pins.

268
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,488
It's the only weapon
we're allowed to carry.

269
00:09:58,506 --> 00:09:59,706
I need you to open it, though.

270
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:03,043
I always prick myself with the
pointy part and get an ouchy.

271
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:32,956
So, what do we do now?

272
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,459
Call the dispatcher,
let her know we're on duty,

273
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:39,079
and she'll give us the
location of our first call.

274
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,630
Eagle Nine awaiting assignment,

275
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:43,166
preferably not in a hilly neighborhood.

276
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,251
Oh, God,

277
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:45,702
that's that idiot from the grocery store

278
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,970
who made his own badge.

279
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:47,971
Shh.

280
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:49,539
10-4, Eagle Nine.

281
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:51,258
Patrol South Natesville.

282
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,143
We're expecting some rough
stuff down there this morning.

283
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:55,044
There's nothing going
on in South Natesville.

284
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:56,847
I know, but if I make him feel
like a cop,

285
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:58,682
he gives me
half-priced rump roast.

286
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:01,685
It's good to know we've got
your boots on the ground.

287
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:04,437
Sorry, James, I was gonna
let you sit up front and steer,

288
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:06,656
but sounds like we have
a date with danger.

289
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:10,577
(bell dinging)

290
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:12,946
Turn signals... out!

291
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,057
I hope it worked.
Oh, it worked.

292
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:25,443
Ah.

293
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,353
I forgot how much
Dancin' Dan likes corn.

294
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:32,023
Let's just figure out which one
is our guy and go catch him.

295
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,028
I don't see him.

296
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,413
Starting to get a weird feeling

297
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,282
like this whole thing's
some kind of trap.

298
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,320
Ooh, there he is!
Get the skimmer ready.

299
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,706
Soon as he hops on one of
those roofied squirrel girls

300
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:49,424
and gets distracted, we'll catch him.

301
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,296
What the heck's he doing?

302
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,165
Maybe the sick bastard only
likes it when they fight back.

303
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,018
(squeaking)

304
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,219
Ooh, ooh!

305
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,604
Go, go, go!

306
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:07,225
Ah!

307
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:08,810
Should we kill him?

308
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:10,195
We can't kill him.

309
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,364
I only believe in the
death penalty for people.

310
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,682
We should gouge his eyes out
like in the Bible.

311
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,953
You only gouge his eyes out
if he's an eye-gouger.

312
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,189
"Eye for an eye" means you do
to him what he did to them.

313
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,775
Well, I'm not doing that.

314
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,211
I guess we got to give
him life in prison.

315
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,630
Isn't that basically
us having a pet squirrel?

316
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,749
Pretty much.

317
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,417
BURT:
Hey, Jimmy.

318
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,636
How'd the rough-and-tumble
go? Bust any skulls?

319
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,322
Not great. I spent eight hours
staring at Barney's sweaty neck.

320
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,641
And I only got to experience
one real crime scene.

321
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,477
This is... disgusting.

322
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,479
(sighs)

323
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:48,216
No matter how many times
you walk these streets,

324
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,068
some things will still
turn your stomach.

325
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,989
Now let's put these recyclables
where they belong.

326
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,741
Glass.

327
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,576
Aluminum.

328
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,944
Glass.

329
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:01,696
Oh, my God!
That's a foot!

330
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,998
That's a human foot!

331
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:03,999
(screams)

332
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,066
It's a human foot!

333
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,835
Oh, hold the boat.

334
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,504
It's just a shoe with
a half-eaten burrito in it.

335
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:14,042
Hopefully tomorrow will be better.

336
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:15,743
What's with the empty cage?

337
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,631
Lockdown!

338
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:28,857
Clear.

339
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,394
Clear.

340
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,064
(whispering): He's still
here somewhere, I know it.

341
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,283
(whispering): Why did you
have a squirrel in a cage?

342
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,284
Clear.

343
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,486
I think he could have gotten away.

344
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:42,454
(screams)

345
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,289
It's on me!

346
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,790
The claws! The claws!

347
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,792
(grunting)

348
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,711
He's in my ear!

349
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,330
Why did you have a squirrel in a cage?!

350
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,884
Are you sure you're okay?

351
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,885
Yeah, mostly.

352
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,253
I don't really want to talk about

353
00:13:58,287 --> 00:13:59,838
what he tried to do to my ear.

354
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:01,005
That squirrel is way too dangerous

355
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:02,557
to be kept in a house with Hope.

356
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,976
Well, if we can't kill him
and we can't keep him here,

357
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,428
what are we gonna do, release him?

358
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:07,562
We're gonna have to.

359
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,264
But we can't just send him out there

360
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,015
to be a repeat offender.

361
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,601
I think we have to...
castrate him.

362
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,737
Okay.

363
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,489
I'll get the knockout pills.
You get the scissors.

364
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,990
No, we can't do it ourselves.

365
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,776
Jimmy's missing part of an ear
from a haircut we gave him.

366
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,913
We're not dabbling in tiny testicles.

367
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:31,241
I'm so happy I'm not really
involved in this story.

368
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,670
DISPATCHER: Would the closest
unit please respond

369
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:37,173
to 827 Variel Street
for a domestic disturbance call.

370
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:38,758
Neighbors report lots of yelling.

371
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,042
Hey, let's take that call.

372
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:41,293
We're not allowed to do that.

373
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:42,428
It's just a noise disturbance.

374
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:43,596
With a lot of yelling.

375
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,080
We can handle it!

376
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:46,098
James, do not.

377
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,583
(grunts)

378
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:49,769
I really don't think we should!

379
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:53,222
Damn it, James, I let
you steer as a treat!

380
00:14:53,256 --> 00:14:55,891
If you have any final words
for your testicles,

381
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:58,444
I suggest you say them now,
'cause in five minutes,

382
00:14:58,478 --> 00:15:00,229
you're gonna be squeaking soprano.

383
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:02,365
Oh, look, a pet squirrel.

384
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,784
Unusual, impractical, and unsanitary.

385
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:06,202
(chuckles):
No, no, no.

386
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:08,204
We're not crazy people
who keep squirrels as pets.

387
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:10,539
No, we just need to have
this little bastard castrated.

388
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:11,524
Excuse me?

389
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,709
That little guy's a sexual predator!

390
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:15,161
He was chasing down the females

391
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:16,445
and taking them against their will.

392
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:17,713
Just because they're not
wearing clothes,

393
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:18,998
doesn't mean they're asking for it.

394
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:21,050
Hide your cats, hide your mice,

395
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:23,002
'cause he's raping everybody up in here.

396
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:25,921
Have you guys ever been
to the zoo in springtime?

397
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,807
Not that we don't appreciate
the vacation suggestion,

398
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:29,642
but we're in a bit of a hurry.

399
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:31,977
No, I'm just trying to say
that what you saw

400
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:34,480
is a completely natural process.

401
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:36,432
It's how animals mate.

402
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,067
In fact, the female was probably

403
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:39,902
giving off pheromones to encourage him.

404
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:41,303
Oh.

405
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:42,988
I see what's going on here.

406
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:44,690
Good old boy's club, huh?

407
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:45,908
Blame the victim.

408
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:48,077
Obviously we came to the wrong place.

409
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,645
We'll just go to another vet.

410
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:52,481
But if this little guy dies in
some back-alley neutering job,

411
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:53,783
it's on your conscience.

412
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:55,284
I can't let you take this squirrel.

413
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:57,119
I'm releasing him into the wild.

414
00:15:57,153 --> 00:15:58,587
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no!

415
00:15:58,622 --> 00:15:59,755
He's gonna hump!

416
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,540
Virginia, cover your ears!

417
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:08,380
If your daughter was a squirrel,
you would never have done that.

418
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:10,349
(girl screams)

419
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,467
(glass shatters)

420
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:13,302
MAN: How many times
have I told you

421
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:16,105
to keep your hands off my work bench?!

422
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,390
All right, you two, hold her down.

423
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:20,860
We got to do something.

424
00:16:20,894 --> 00:16:23,729
If you don't stand still,
I'm gonna cut off your finger.

425
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:26,148
Cover me.

426
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:30,653
Ah! Dang it!

427
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:33,656
I have to start wearing
my thimble again.

428
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:37,576
Natesville Auxiliary Police.

429
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:40,579
Uh, you have the right to
voluntarily open up this door.

430
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,716
What do you want?
I'm busy.

431
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,251
Hurry up! It hurts!

432
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:47,002
I know! Shut up!

433
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:49,037
Do you know how to get rid of splinters?

434
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:51,807
I'm watching my sister's kids,
man; I'm in way over my head.

435
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:54,143
Give me that safety pin.

436
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:56,178
♪

437
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:29,461
Thank you, Officer.

438
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:39,305
That vet sure treated us
like we're idiots.

439
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:40,589
We're not idiots.

440
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,807
Of course not.

441
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:44,092
I mean, even if that is
how animals have sex,

442
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,644
how were we supposed to know that?

443
00:17:45,695 --> 00:17:48,814
Well, you're supposed to be the expert.

444
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:50,900
You're a landscaper.

445
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:52,535
Your whole workday is outside.

446
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:54,486
From 9:00 to noon,
you're in their world.

447
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:56,488
I don't stare.

448
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,773
I'm not a pervert.

449
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,291
Who do you think I am,

450
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:01,493
that creepy crow that hangs out
by the playground?

451
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:03,779
I don't care what the vet says.

452
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:06,165
Any normal person who saw what we saw

453
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:08,417
would have hunted down
that squirrel, captured him,

454
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:10,469
kept him in a cage till he escaped,

455
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:13,121
and then with no other options,
sentenced him to castration.

456
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:17,843
We're not gonna tell anybody
about this, are we?

457
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:19,728
Absolutely not.

458
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:23,682
Hey, what are you doing here?

459
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,734
I had to bring her home.

460
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:27,686
I just couldn't do it.

461
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:29,989
I just don't think I have
what it takes to be a mother.

462
00:18:30,023 --> 00:18:32,107
I mean, God tried to tell me
by giving me narrow hips,

463
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:33,275
but I just didn't listen.

464
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:35,411
First, she wanted to watch her

465
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:36,912
<i>Dee Dee the Dancing Dolphin</i> DVD.

466
00:18:36,947 --> 00:18:39,147
And I love Morgan Freeman,
but somebody has got to

467
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:41,917
tell that guy that it is
okay to turn down a job.

468
00:18:41,952 --> 00:18:45,704
And when that was finally over,
Hope wanted to watch it again.

469
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:46,505
<i>And again.</i>

470
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:47,673
(dolphin squeaking)

471
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:51,510
<i>And again. And again.</i>

472
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:53,495
And then she wanted to play
"knock down the block tower."

473
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:55,714
So I built her a block tower
and she knocked it down,

474
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,349
while she watched
<i>Dee Dee the Dancing Dolphin.</i>

475
00:18:57,384 --> 00:18:58,601
<i>Again.</i>

476
00:18:58,635 --> 00:18:59,635
<i>And again. And again.</i>

477
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,520
(groans)

478
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:03,639
And then she wanted to
hear <i>Harriet Hugs a Hippo,</i>

479
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:06,025
which, by the way, is ten
"H" words strewn together

480
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,693
to make sentences, all right?

481
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:10,229
"Harriet happily hugs a hairy
hippo while a horse hugs a ham."

482
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,032
And how do I know that? Because
I read it to her 20 times

483
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:14,516
while she knocked down the block tower,

484
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:16,402
while watched <i>Dee Dee</i>
<i>the Dancing Dolphin.</i>

485
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:20,372
<i>Again. And again. And again.</i>

486
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:22,207
And that's when I passed out.

487
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:24,243
<i>And that's when this happened.</i>

488
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:26,245
And that is when I started calling

489
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:27,663
random nannies from my childhood,

490
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:30,299
so I could go to the bathroom
and drink a peach martini

491
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,884
and read <i>US Magazine.</i>

492
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:34,803
And that is when I realized:

493
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:36,338
I'm just like my mother.

494
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:38,223
You're not like your mother.

495
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,808
You love being with Hope.

496
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:42,011
You're just better at the fun stuff,

497
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:44,313
and I'm better at being nurturing.

498
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:47,215
And it's okay,
as long as Hope has both of us.

499
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:52,271
Oh, hey.

500
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:54,556
While I was on patrol,

501
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:56,158
I stumbled across
someone's organic garden,

502
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:57,943
and I brought you a treat.

503
00:19:57,994 --> 00:19:59,328
(chuckles)

504
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:00,996
They grew strawberries in this.

505
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:03,832
I love strawberries.

506
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:04,867
(chuckles)

507
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:11,790
(sighs)

508
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,375
Hope, what are you doing out of bed?

509
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:14,877
It's late.

510
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:16,211
Let me do this.

511
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:17,796
It's the one thing I'm good at.

512
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:21,633
Hope, I need you to go back to bed

513
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:23,135
and go to sleep, okay?

514
00:20:23,186 --> 00:20:24,219
No!

515
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:27,189
Why isn't this working?

516
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:28,974
I don't know.

517
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:32,811
Hope, I said it's time to go to bed.

518
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:34,863
No, Mommy.

519
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:39,768
She called me "Mommy."

520
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:43,655
JIMMY: <i>Sabrina may not have</i>
<i>proved to herself</i>

521
00:20:43,707 --> 00:20:46,274
<i>she was mother material,</i>
<i>but by spending a whole weekend</i>

522
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:49,578
<i>doing all the hard work,</i>
<i>she proved it to Hope.</i>

523
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:52,314
<i>And while being called Mommy</i>
<i>didn't make all the monotonous,</i>

524
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:54,249
<i>boring parts of raising a kid</i>
<i>any easier,</i>

525
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:55,751
<i>it made them worth it.</i>

526
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:58,286
<i>Of course, the downside was</i>
<i>that once a kid bonds with you</i>

527
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,122
<i>and knows that you love them</i>
<i>unconditionally,</i>

528
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,458
<i>they aren't afraid of you anymore.</i>

529
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:04,626
(doorbell rings)

530
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:06,395
Right on time.
Come in!

531
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,930
<i>So, sometimes you have to call</i>

532
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:09,732
<i>a professional authority figure.</i>

533
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:12,518
Hope, go to bed this instant!

534
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:13,902
(gasps)

535
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:21,174
Well, glad I could help.

536
00:21:21,294 --> 00:21:24,016
I have to head down to the hospital now
and get a statement from Dancin' Dan.

537
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:27,345
Apparently some sicko drugged him
in the park, gave him a nasty ear infection.
