00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,740
但是我没有
And -- and I didn't.

156
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,220
我其实是挺耐心的
Me. I was patient.

157
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,070
你难道不惊讶吗
Isn't that amazing?

158
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,790
确实  能把镊子递给我一下吗
Yes. Can you hand me the forceps?

159
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,290
你不能一直都因为打垒球的事生我气啊
Okay, you cannot still be upset about the softball thing.

160
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,620
这次打垒球的事  嗯哼
This "Softball thing." Hmm.

161
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,110
我把尊严都踩在了脚下
I-I put my pride on the line

162
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,820
在我的下属面前恳请加入这次课外活动
And beg to be included in an extracurricular activity in front of my employees.

163
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,320
你干嘛看的那么重啊
Why is it so important to you?

164
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,760
那为什么搭建部门间的桥梁是那么重要呢
Why is it so important to build interdepartmental bridges?

165
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,680
明显你从未参加过垒球联赛
You've clearly never played in a softball league.

166
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,980
你不想让我们玩是因为你很厉害
You just don't want us to play because you're too competitive

167
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,620
而且觉得我们水平很烂
and you don't think we're any good.

168
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,200
我说的对吗
I'm right, aren't I?

169
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,110
没错
Yes.

170
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,080
至少你还算诚实
At least you're honest.

171
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,980
他依然有着很棒的肌肉
He still has remarkable musculature.

172
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,850
他肯定不吃自己的蛋糕
He must not eat his cakes.

173
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,890
没错
Yeah.

174
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,600
恩佐曾经是这些年来第一个有机会成为
Enzo was the first B.C.U player in years

175
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,090
职业运动员的BCU球员
who could have gone pro.

176
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,980
我觉得在前十字韧带撕裂以后
I'm guessing that wasn't an option

177
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,670
他就没这个机会了
Once he tore his anterior cruciate ligament.

178
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,130
伤疤看起来大概有五年之久了
Scar tissue looks to be about five years old.

179
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,200
BCU传球给"达阵"
B.C.U going for the money with a hand-off to end zone.

180
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,990
天哪  他跑的可真快啊
Man, he was fast.

181
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,830
哦  不
Oh, no!

182
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,610
沃马克被狠狠拦截了
Womack is tackled hard.

183
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,050
他爬不起来了
He's not getting up.

184
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,740
各位  这可不妙
Folks, this does not look good.

185
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,900
人生变化之快令人惊叹
It's amazing how fast your life can change.

186
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,020
夺走凯西一切的不过是个简易爆炸装置
All it took for Casey was an I.E.D.

187
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,040
一些弹片  还有战争
and some shrapnel. And a war.

188
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,680
我猜凯西是顺道来看你
My guess is Casey dropped by to see you.

189
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,790
别猜了  你不擅长
Stop guessing. You're bad at it.

190
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,720
他是过来看科萨克的
He came by to see Korsak.

191
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,390
别再给我计时了  我不说凯西了
Oh, stop timing me. I'll stop talking about Casey.

192
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,030
有一些刀柄的印记
There are hilt marks...

193
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,530
这儿  这儿
There and there.

194
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,140
那些印记可能是由小刀造成的
Those are probably from the knife.

195
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,370
也许是一把小的巴克军用刺刀
A small buck knife, maybe?

196
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,610
很多刀都有刀柄
Well, many knives have hilts --

197
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,300
求生刀  猎刀  
Survival knives, hunting knives,

198
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,510
削皮刀  战斗用刀  短刀
Skinning knives, commando knives, tanto knives.

199
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,170
你能停下来吗
Can you please stop?

200
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,010
有某种微粒物质黏在伤口上
Some kind of particulate matter adhered to the wound.

201
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,650
肯定是从刀上掉下来的
Well, that must have come off the knife.

202
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,810
还有白色纤维  在那儿
And white fibers -- there.

203
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,920
我会让罪证化验室拿去分析
I'll have the crime lab analyze all this.

204
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,990
受害者的货车在罪证车库里
Okay, the victim's van is in the evidence garage.

205
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,750
我马上回来
I'll be back.

206
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,470
你能考虑下打垒球的事吗
Will you think about the, uh, "Softball thing"?

207
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,330
好的
Yes.

208
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
谢了
Thank you.

209
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,890
不好意思  答案还是不行
Sorry, the answer's still no.

210
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,180
我们找到了一堆蛋糕装饰材料
We got a bunch of cake-decorating stuff.

211
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,730
都被喷出来的动脉血和洗车泡沫给覆盖了
It's all covered with arterial blood spray and car-wash suds.

212
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,400
凶手很聪明
Killer was smart.

213
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,120
他把我们能用于控告的任何机会都给毁了
He ruined any chance we had of making a case with forensics.

214
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,770
看起来当时挺刺激的
Doesn't it seem a little spur of the moment,

215
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,780
在洗车过程中把人刺伤
Stabbing someone in a car wash?

216
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,860
是啊
Yeah.

217
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,920
我马上拍下来再检验一下
I'll get it all photographed and tested.

218
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,740
弗罗斯特在哪儿
Where's Frost?

219
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,070
搜查令批了下来
Well, the warrant came through.

220
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,470
他在捣鼓恩佐的电脑
He's working on Enzo's laptop

221
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,550
还一直试着干燥他的手机
and still trying to dry out his cellphone.

222
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,390
好吧  我会让罪证化验室对比检验
Okay, I'll have the crime lab

223
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,070
这里所有的工具和刀具
comparison-test all the tools and knives in here.

224
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,230
莫拉觉得凶器有刀柄
Maura thinks that the murder weapon had a hilt.

225
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,230
这个就有个刀柄
This has a hilt.

226
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,840
我不知道他会来
I didn't know he was coming.

227
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,430
我了解
Yeah, I figured.

228
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,660
他问了你的很多事情
He asked a lot of questions about you.

229
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,600
真的吗
Really?

230
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,310
为什么他把艾西留给你
Why did he leave Elsie?

231
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,690
我要照顾她一段时间
I'm taking care of her for a while.

232
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,160
他知道如果他带它来  我是不会拒绝的
He knew if he brought her by, I couldn't refuse her.

233
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,300
你要照看它吗  照看多久
You're taking care of her? For how long?

234
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,850
或许几个月吧
Maybe a few months.

235
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,170
为什么啊  他要去哪儿  他没细说
Why? Where's he going? He didn't go into details.

236
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,490
你是个警探  你怎么不问啊
You're a detective. Didn't you ask?

237
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,610
我不想多打听
I didn't want to pry!

238
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,420
男的都是这样
Oh, that's so male.

239
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,110
你觉得这是糖霜吗
You think this is frosting?

240
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,900
可能吧  罪证化验室能检验出来
Maybe. Crime lab can test it.

241
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,570
看啊  我们至少找到了够吃几年的
Look, we got at least several years' worth

242
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,310
糖霜和蛋糕屑了
of frosting and cake crumbs.

243
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,220
"放旦"是什么鬼东西
What the hell is "Fun-dant"?

244
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,700
是方旦糖
Fondant.

245
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,150
那东西很黏很甜还不能吃
And it's sticky, sweet, inedible crap

246
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,130
他们把它放到蛋糕上
That they put on cakes.

247
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,670
别把它放在庆祝退休的蛋糕上
Don't put it on retirement cake.

248
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,850
会注意的
Duly noted.

249
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,620
真是条乖狗  艾西
You're a good girl, elsie.

250
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,060
它是最棒的狗
Oh, she's the best.

251
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,210
还是一条肢障服务犬
And you're a service dog.

252
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,450
凯西需要你  你在这儿干嘛呢 
Casey needs you, so what are you doing here?

253
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,310
嘿  妈妈 
Hey, ma.

这是弗罗斯特警探的妈妈卡米尔

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,020
多好的一个男人啊
What a nice man.

263
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,690
他开车带着我和我的室友还有她的孩子
He drove me and my roommate and her son

264
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,070
在我们等巴里期间在波士顿四处转悠
all over Boston while we were waiting for Barry.

265
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,650
没错  他是个好孩子
Yeah, he's a good kid.

266
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,490
你儿子和我女儿简就像这个一样
And, uh, your son and my daughter, Jane, are like this.

267
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,650
我希望我能住的近一些
I wish I lived closer.

268
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,030
我觉得我从未见过他一样
I feel like I never see him.

269
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,180
你住在维吉尼亚州对吗
You live in, uh, Virginia, right?

270
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,010
诺福克
Norfolk.

271
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,150
我在那里的一所军校教书
I teach at one of the military universities there.

272
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,920
真好啊  你教什么的
Nice. What do you teach?

273
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,130
土木工程
Civil engineering.

274
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,730
现在我们知道弗罗斯特的智商是遗传谁了
Well, now we know where, uh, detective Frost gets his brains.

275
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,640
他爸爸其实也很聪明
His father was actually pretty smart, too.

276
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,650
我们20年前离了婚
Uh, we divorced 20 years ago.

277
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,780
我刚离婚
I just got divorced.

278
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,480
真对不起

我不觉得
I'm not.

280
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,160
不再觉得
Well, anymore.

281
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,670
要我帮你拿杯咖啡吗
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

282
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,790
不需要  谢谢
Oh, no, thank you.

283
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,010
我觉得在路上已经喝得够多了
I think I already had enough on the way here.

284
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,760
我一直都在试着鼓起勇气
I'm actually trying to work up the nerve

285
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,630
告诉巴里我准备再婚了
to tell Barry that I'm getting remarried.

286
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,460
恭喜啊
Oh. Congratulations.

287
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,060
为什么这还会让你紧张呢
Why is that making you nervous?

288
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,660
离婚让他很难过
The divorce was hard on him.

289
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,480
并且我从未出去约会过
And I never dated.

290
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,190
别误解我
Well, don't get me wrong.

291
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,090
巴里很尊重我
Barry is very respectful,

292
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,090
但你知道的  他有着很强烈的意见
But knowing him, you know, he has strong opinions.

293
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,340
我们把他们带大
Well, we did bring them up

294
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,660
就是为了让他们有自己的想法
to have their own minds.

295
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,230
没错
Yes, we did.

296
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,390
转变就是如此无常  不是吗
It's crazy how the tables turn, isn't it?

297
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,420
我和这个男的交往有一段时间了
I was seeing this guy for a while,

298
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,020
我的孩子都快疯了
And, uh, my kids went nuts.

299
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,330
那你又怎样了
What'd you do?

300
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,680
感觉很内疚
Felt guilty.

301
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,930
但然后我决定我不能活在别人的世界里
But then I decided I was allowed to be a person, too.

302
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,630
没错
Yes, you are.

303
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,900
失陪一下
Excuse me.

304
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,190
我觉得你应该抱怨一下你的午饭啊

你觉得你能一次又一次这么做吗

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,520
-不  不好  -那你为什么还为他工作

你知道在当下的经济状况
Do you know how hard it is

440
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,670
找到一份像样的工作有多难吗

我主修过性别研究
I have a major in gender studies.

442
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,880
我懂你的意思
Ooh. Yeah, I know what you mean.

443
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,230
在我看来
Well, it seems to me that

444
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,540
恩佐的行为促使你杀了他  劳拉
Enzo gave you a reason to kill him, Laura.

445
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,280
他确实该杀  不过我没有

446
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,260
我当时在健身房  你们可以查

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,170
我晚上还要去健身

450
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,310
真想不到劳拉有这么确凿的不在场证明
It's a shame that Laura has a solid alibi.

451
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,510
我仍然认为恩佐在玩一个危险的游戏
Still, I think Enzo was playing a dangerous game.

452

你觉得是他的滥交

00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,000
说不准
Maybe.

455

莫拉检测完了所有刀
Okay, Maura's finished testing all the knives.

456
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,950
我们的凶器不属于那家蛋糕店
Our murder weapon is not that bakery.

457
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,330
罗宾能陪你妈来真是太好了
So, it's nice that Robin came with your mom,

458
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,100
这样她就有人陪了
You know, so she could have some company.

459
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,710
我妈真的很独立  不过  我猜的
My mom's really independent, but, yeah, I guess.

460
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,880
她们怎么认识的
How do they know each other?

461
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,290
她们都是诺福克海军大学的教授
They're both professors at the naval university in Norfolk.

462
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,890
我不知道你妈是教授
I didn't know your mom was a professor.

463
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,470
我妈的课是海军大学第一批
My mom was in one of the first classes

464
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,590
允许有女老师教讲的课之一
at the naval academy that allowed women.

465
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,690
没开玩笑吧
Are you kidding me?

466
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,010
她可牛了
She's amazing.

467
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,530
她和我爸都上的海军学校
She and my dad were midshipmen together.

468
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,770
他们在那儿认识的
That's how they met.

469
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,720
她在事业上不输我爸
He had the career she should have.

470
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,170
你妈妈和罗宾是室友  对吧
And they're roommates, y-your mom and Robin?

471
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,030
罗宾离婚后  她们决定一起分担开销
After Robin's divorce, they decided to share expenses.

472
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,300
教授赚钱不容易啊
Professors don't make that much.

473
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,800
两人在一起挺好的
Well, it's good they have each other.

474
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,610
我是说  一起分担开销挺好的
I mean to -- to share expenses.

475
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,840
那倒是真的
No kidding.

476
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,670
走吧  下班啦
Come on. Let's call it a day.

477
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,330
这赛季只剩两场比赛了
We got two games left in the season,

478
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,540
今天再不练习的话
and if we don't get in a practice today,

479
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,280
要被缉毒组横扫了
the Drug Unit's gonna kick our ass.

480
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,120
既然你都这么说了
Since you put it that way...

481
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,850
我带上我妈行吗
You think it's okay if -- if I bring my mom?

482
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,160
还有罗宾和卡梅隆
Oh, and -- and Robin and Cameron, too?

483
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,870
当然
Sure.

484
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,140
可以
Yeah.

485
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,110
莫拉
Maura.

486
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,470
简
Jane.

487
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,140
没想到你们连练习都不叫上我们
Can't believe you weren't gonna tell us about practice.

488
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,820
行了  听着  这赛季只剩两场比赛了
Okay...look, there are only two more games left in the season,

489
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,280
再说我们会被取消资格的
and -- and we'll be disqualified.

490
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,810
你们又不是凶案组的
You're not part of homicide.

491
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,900
那弗罗斯特的妈妈就是了吗
Oh, so Frost's mom is part of homicide?

492
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,930
简  我们来猜拳分组  打场练习赛吧
Jane, we could buck up sides and have a scrimmage.

493
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,570
猜拳  你是还没长大吗
Buck up? Who are you, Opie?

494
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,060
-谁还没长大  -别多嘴  亲爱的
- Who's Opie? - Shh. Honey.

495
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,680
莫拉  你们人数不够组成一队
Maura, you -- you don't have enough players for a team.

496
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,540
我们愿意加入莫拉的队伍
Oh, we'd be happy to play for Maura's team.

497
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,870
对啊  好呀
Yeah. Why not?

498
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,300
我俩不过是找个机会锻炼锻炼的老女人
We're just a couple of old ladies looking for some exercise.

499
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,250
好吧

500
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,380
好了  你要加油了  简
All right. So, you're gonna have to buck up, Jane.

501
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,090
乐意至极
I'd love to.

502
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,190
赢家给输家买喝的  再公平不过了
It's only fair that the winners buy the losers drinks.

503
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,580
科萨克能带卡梅隆去吃冰淇淋
Korsak got to take Cameron to icecream.

504
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,740
我们就得在这儿忍受这个
We got to endure this?

505
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,150
实验室出结果了  艾尔斯医生

均为葡萄糖基糖类化合物
in the van were glucose-based confectioner's compounds.

509
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,480

Swell.

510
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,730
以及血液和肥皂中的甘油
And blood and glycerin from the soap.

511
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,950
超级了不起
Double swell.

512
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,240
除去一种物质
There was one exception.

513
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,780
你们在后车厢垫子上发现的蓝色物质
The blue substance that you found on the rear floor mat

514
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,240
是部分场地油漆
is bulk of field paint.

515
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,350
场地油漆
Field paint?

516
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,040
波士顿剑桥大学的球场是蓝色的
BCU's colors are blue and...

517
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,030
苏西  你能查查那油漆
Susie, can you check and see if

518
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,310
是否来自波士顿剑桥大学吗
that field paint is from BCU?

519
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,830
-是  没问题  -多谢了
- Yeah, sure. - Thank you.

520
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:56,610
就俩需要锻炼的老太太
Oh, just two old ladies in need of some exercise.

521
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,860
我看有人没说实话
Mm. I think somebody lied.

522
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,730
是实话  我们不就是老太太吗
It wasn't a lie. We are old ladies.

523
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,260
再说我们确实需要锻炼了
And we needed exercise.

524
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,870
比赛太刺激了
It was such an exciting game.

525
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,060
6比1  我们完胜
6-1. We trounced you.

526
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,150
我们
"We"?

527
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,780
卡米尔打出两记本垒打
Camille hit two home runs,

528
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,820
罗宾打出一记满垒本垒打
and Robin hit a grand slam.

529
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,470
所以你得两分  你得四分  你没得分
So 2 for you, 4 for you, and zero for you.

530
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,280
完全正确
Exactly.

531
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,180
这俩枪手替你打了  有你什么事儿
And is it a "we" when you got two ringers?

532
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,620
我的天啊  你早就知道了
Oh, my god! You knew.

533
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,420
我没想到罗宾挥棒还那么有力
Well, I figured Robin's swing had lost some power.

534
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,360
弗罗斯特
Frost!

535
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,270
再说老妈  你都很久没打了
And mom -- you haven't played in a while.

536
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,560
我们也以为自己腿脚不灵活了呢
We thought we were rustier than we were.

537
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,190
我们只得了一分  就一分
We scored one run -- one.

538
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,480
我觉得你们打得挺好的
I think you played really well.

539
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,510
肯定得被缉毒组灭了
The Drug Unit's gonna destroy us.

540
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,880
让我们加入就不会了
Well, not if you let us play.

541
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,060
你说的"我们"是指卡米尔和罗宾吧
And by "us", you mean Camille and Robin?

542
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,490
你真是输不起
You're a very sore loser.

543
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,590
再怎么说我也到第一垒了
I did make it to the first base.

544
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,770
-哪有人说"第" 啊  -什么
- You don't say "the". - What?

545
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,550
你到达了一垒  可你是被保送上垒的
You made it to first base because you were walked.

546
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,860
保送上垒很好啊
You know, walking's good.

547
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,650
-敬保送上垒  -敬保送上垒
- To the walk. - To the walk.

548
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,420
继续保送
Walking.

549
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,550
你踢我腿干嘛
Why are you kicking my leg?

550
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,970
我只能对罗宾和卡米尔拱手示弱了
I s-should hand it to Robin and Camille.

551
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:11,970
阿刚暗示弗兰基  罗宾和卡米尔手上戴了结婚戒指

552
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,690
简  你伤到脖子了吗  肌肉抽筋了吗
Jane, did you hurt your neck? Are you having a muscle spasm?

553
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,720
还不懂啊
Really?

554
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,790
我要举杯敬酒
I'd like to propose a toast.

555
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,420
这才叫有球品呢
That's great sportsmanship.

556
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,500
看见没  为优胜队举杯庆贺
See? Toasting the winning team.

557
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,270
敬两位好人
Uh, to two wonderful people

558
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,670
她们教会了我爱和承诺的意义
who have taught me the meaning of love and commitment --

559
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,320
我妈妈  还有她的伴侣罗宾
My mom...and her partner, Robin.

561
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,660
是的  妈妈  我早知道了
Yeah, mom, I knew.

562
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,900
我都苦恼好几年了
I had been agonizing over this for years.

563
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,380
你从没提过  我也不想多问
You never brought it up. It wasn't my business.

564
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,100
亲爱的
Honey.

565
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,660
我想你愿意说的时候  会告诉我的
I figured if you wanted to tell me, you would.

566
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,570
我就说吧
I told you.

567
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,430
你就是对他没信心
You've never given him enough credit.

568
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,650
为什么不早告诉我呢
I just wish I'd known.

569
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,600
我邀请你们来麻省都多少次啦
How many times have I invited you to Massachusetts?

570

我一直希望你能让她敞开心扉
I kept hoping you'd make an honest woman out of her.

571

很高兴你做到了

其实我们还没定日子呢
We actually haven't even set the date yet.

577
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,880
是时候告诉你了  巴里

我正好有件漂亮衣服没穿过呢
Oh, and I have a great dress I haven't worn yet.

582
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,600
人家又没邀请你
You haven't been invited.

583
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,770

我只是不想进去
I mean I don't want to go inside.

599
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,780
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

600
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,490
上楼听你道歉
Upstairs to hear your apology.

601

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,240
来了  算了
Coming. Okay.

608
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,080
你没事吧
Are you okay?

609
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,610
对  没事
Yeah. I'm fine.

610
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,050
进来吧  请坐
Uh, come in. Um, sit down.

611
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,490
给你拿瓶啤酒  还是
Can -- can I get you a beer or...

612
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,880
拿杯水吧
Maybe a water.

613
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,160
喝水  好的
A water. Okay.

614
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,100
谢谢
Thanks.

615
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,950
还记得我上次来的时候
I remember the last time I was here.

616
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,590
就在你最后一次去阿富汗前夜
Right before your last tour in Afghanistan.

617
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,780
我的终极之旅
My final tour.

618
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,950
就像是滑雪道上的最后一滑
It's like the last run on a ski slope.

619
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,970
摔倒的时候才想着早知道不冒这个险了
You know as you're falling you shouldn't have taken it.

620
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,030
谢谢你能上来  我知道你并不想这样
Thank you for coming up. I-I know you didn't want to.

621
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,870
我想  只是
I did. I ju--

622
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,520
我不想离你这么近
I didn't want to be this close to you.

623
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,400
凯西
Casey.

624
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,680
别这样
Please.

625
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,920
对不起
I'm sorry.

626
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,100
我让科萨克警司
I asked Sergeant Korsak

627
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,310
照顾艾西是因为我要动手术
to look after Elsie because I'm having surgery.

628
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,050
手术  什么时候
Surgery? W-when?

629
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,160
快了
Soon.

630
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,850
是干细胞试验
The stem-cell trials?

631
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,380
不  我没有参与试验
No. I'm not a candidate.

632
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,340
我找到一位神经外科医生
I found a neurosurgeon.

633
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,150
他觉得他能取出
He thinks he can remove the, uh, shrapnel

634
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,320
压迫着我脊髓的弹片和骨头碎片  
and bone shards from pressing against my spinal cord.

635
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,990
凯西  真是太好了
Casey, that's incredible.

636
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,050
手术是有风险的
There are no guarantees,

637
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,170
而且术后复健还要花很长时间
and, uh...and there will be months of rehab.

638
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,310
但这是我长久以来
But it's the first crack

639
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,270
第一次看到希望
of light I've seen in a pretty dark tunnel.

640
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,760
让我  让我帮你吧
Well, let me -- let me help you.

641
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,300
我想陪着你一起做这些事
I-I want to go through this with you.

642
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,150
我就是不想这样才没有联系你
That's exactly why I didn't get in touch.

643
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:49,150
凯西  这不要紧的  明白吗
Casey... i-it doesn't matter, okay?

644
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,380
我很在乎你
I care about you.

645
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,370
不
No.

646
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,850
一段关系不该这样开始
This is no way to start a relationship,

647
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,180
而我俩现在就处于这样的开端
and this is where we are -- at the beginning.

648
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,960
好  那我们就快进一下
Okay, well, let's get to the middle.

649
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,040
我想这么做
I want to do this.

650
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,120
照顾一个病人会给亲密关系带来很多丑陋
Taking care of an invalid is an ugly form of intimacy.

651
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,700
这事一点也不浪漫  简
There's no romance in it, Jane.

652
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,120
这种病只是改变了你的外在
This injury isn't you.

653
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,730
你的内心并没有变
This is you.

654
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,730
我应该要你留下的
I should have asked you not to go.

655
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,000
我应该要你等我的
I should have asked you to wait.

656
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,250
我不在的时候你有跟别人约会吗
Did you see someone else while I was gone?

657
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,950
有
Yes.

658
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,470
你在乎过他吗
Did you care about him?

659
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,190
是的
Yes.

660
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,020
那你以后也能找到另一个人
Then you'll find someone again.

661
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,040
什么  不
What? No.

662
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,900
凯西  等一下  等等
Casey, wait a minute. Wait.

663
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,530
我跟那人没什么了  早就结束了
It's over with him. It's -- it's been over.

664
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,940
听着  当我再见到你时我才知道
Look, I realized that when I saw you again

665
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,890
自己有多希望和你在一起
how much I want this to work.

666
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,320
但是不行
This won't work.

667
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,010
可以的
It will.

668
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,920
凯西  就给我一个机会  求你了
Casey, please, just give me a chance. Please.

669
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,770
为我做一件事
Do one thing for me.

670
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,240
做什么都行
Anything.

671
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,690
让我吻你
Let me kiss you...

672
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,620
然后忘了我
and then let me go.

673
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,060
凯西  别这样  求你了
Casey, please, please.

674
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,790
再见了  简
Goodbye, Jane.

675
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,510
袜子都去哪儿了
Where do socks go?

676
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,970
你只需要一个半英寸的空档
All you need is a half-inch gap

677
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,220
让它们从搅拌叶片下面掉出来
for them to slip under the agitator paddle.

678
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,510
所以不是到袜子天堂去了
So not sock heaven.

679
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,760
去你抽屉里找找
Check your drawers.

680
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,600
因为静电它们总跟其他衣物粘在一起
Static electricity causes them to stick to other clothing.

681
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,470
我希望恩佐能去橄榄球天堂
I hope Enzo gets to go to football heaven.

682
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,530
谢谢你过来
Thank you for coming.

683
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,670
别扔了呀
Don't throw them away!

684
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,010
找不到另一只了  形单影只只会让我伤感
They don't have partners. They're making me sad.

685
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,790
好吧  告诉我他说了什么
Okay. Tell me what he said.

686
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,470
他要做手术取出弹片和骨头碎片
He is having surgery to remove bone and shrapnel.

687
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,430
怎么  你表情干嘛那么奇怪
What? What's with the weird look?

688
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,770
没什么
It's nothing.

689
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,690
起疹了  莫拉
Hives, Maura.

690
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,050
即使是善意的谎言也会让你发痒
Even white lies make you itch.

691
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,340
好吧
Okay.

692
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,510
凯西的病被称作马尾神经综合征
Casey's condition is called cauda equina syndrome.

693
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,300
从我在他身上观察到的情况来看
From what I've observed in him,

694
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,600
可能影响了第11和12胸椎  或许还有第1腰椎
it probably involves T-11 and -12 and maybe L-1.

695
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,570
还是那问题  为什么你表情怪怪的
Same question -- why the weird look?

696
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,020
给部分身体受损的截瘫病人动手术非常危险
Surgery on a partially impaired paraplegic is very risky.

697
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,290
你又不是神经外科医生
Well, you're not a neurosurgeon.

698
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,590
你说的对  我不是
You're right. I'm not.

699
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,100
那就别乱猜
So no guessing.

700
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,070
我只想装作一切都会没事的
I just want to pretend like it's all gonna be fine.

701
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,500
你也能这样吗
Can you do that with me?

702
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,310
我可以试试
I can try.

703
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,360
敬礼  艾西  好姑娘
Salute, Elsie. Good girl!

704
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,630
敬得不错  艾西
Good salute, Elsie.

705
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,830
那不是在敬礼
That wasn't a salute.

706
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,330
当然是啦
Yes, it was.

707
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,700
我看更像是握手
Looked like "shake" to me.

708
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,000
谁想要面包圈吗
Anybody want a bagel?

709
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,610
我要  谢谢
Yeah. Thanks.

710
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,630
好了  我们进展到哪里了
All right, so, where are we?

711
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,910
什么进展都没有
We are nowhere.

712
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,010
我们最好赶快有所发现
We better get somewhere

713
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,740
不然卡瓦诺夫就要发飙了
or Cavanaugh's gonna tear off some heads.

714
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,290
也许我能帮上忙
Maybe I can help.

715
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,450
都是因为团队建设的垒球赛
Thanks to the team-building softball game,

716
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,960
罪证化验室的人工作了整晚
the crime lab stayed up all night

717
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,220
把这些结果给你弄出来了
to get these results to you.

718
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,400
我还以为他们卖力帮忙破案是因为
I thought they were helping us solve murders because --

719
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,200
那什么  这是他们的本职工作呀
oh, I don't know -- it's their job.

720
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,260
地毯上的蓝色颜料跟波士顿剑桥大学用在
The blue paint on the floor mat is consistent

721
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,410
场地上的颜料是一样的
with the paint used for the BCU field stencils.

722
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,070
那正是凶手曾去过的地方
That's right where the killer would have been.

723
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,100
弗罗斯特  你说恩佐有赛季套票
Frost, you said that Enzo had season tickets.

724
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,390
周六的比赛他去了吗
Was he at Saturday's game?

725
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,810
不  他的票没用过
No. His ticket wasn't used,

726
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,470
所以我联系了他办公室的负责人跟进
so I followed up with his office manager.

727
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,140
恩佐要做一个结婚蛋糕所以没去
Enzo had to work on a wedding cake.

728
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,700
那是赛季的第一场比赛
It was the first game of the season,

729
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,440
也就是说不是恩佐把场地颜料
which means Enzo didn't transfer that field paint

730
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
带到他车里的
inside his van.

731
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,750
也许是凶手带去的
Maybe our murderer did.

732
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,940
我原先看的时候还没觉得特别  看看这个
It didn't mean anything when I looked at it, but watch this.

733
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,370
恩佐在看这段周六比赛的录像
Enzo was watching this clip from Saturday's game.

734
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,910
那是什么战术呀
What kind of call is that?

735
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,140
菲利普斯教练  我们对他有什么了解
Coach Phillips? What do we know about him?

736
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,220
简  他的动机会是什么呢
Jane, what would be the motive?

737
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,810
恩佐已经五年没在他手下打球了
Enzo hadn't played for him for five years.

738
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,390
菲利普斯想要争夺一个甲级联盟的教练职位
Phillips was a contender for a division I coaching gig.

739
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,760
五年前波士顿剑桥大学输了那个赛季
It went away after BCU lost that season

740
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,840
这工作也就没戏了
five years ago.

741
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,300
蒂姆・菲利普斯采访

742
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:08,350
我失望吗  当然  我当然失望
Am I disappointed? Yeah, yeah, I'm disappointed.

743
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,820
成为甲级联盟的教练是我的梦想
Coaching a division I team is a dream of mine.

744
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,910
可是  波士顿剑桥大学
But, uh, BCU --

745
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,700
我们本来胜算在握
we had a great run there

746
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,400
直到恩佐受伤了
till Enzo hurt himself.

747
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,200
听上去菲利普斯是在责怪恩佐
Sounds like Phillips blames Enzo.

748
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,800
蓝色颜料只告诉了我们
Well, that blue paint only tells us

749
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,520
凶手曾经出现在球场上
that our killer was on that field.

750
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,830
弗罗斯特  手机能正常使用了吗
Frost, you get the phone working yet?

751
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,370
还没  得把电池放进去
No. Got to put the battery back in.

752
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,000
好  我想看看恩佐被杀前一晚
Okay, I want to see what else Enzo was watching

753
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,620
还看了些什么
the night before he was killed.

754
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,770
他的电脑在波士顿地区情报中心
His laptop is in BRIC.

755
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,570
好的
Okay.

756
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,590
科萨克警司
Sergeant Korsak,

757
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,650
凯西有没有告诉你为什么要你照顾艾西
did Casey tell you why he needed you to take Elsie?

758
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,740
没有  他只说她可能这几个月需要另一个家
No. He just said she might need a home for a few months.

759
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,200
他跟我说了些事  但我不想让简知道
He mentioned something I didn't want Jane to hear.

760
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,050
说了什么
What was that?

761
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,820
他要我保证如果他发生什么意外
He made me promise I would take care of Elsie

762
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,460
我会照顾艾西
if anything happened to him.

763
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,140
-喂  你们还来不来  -来了
- Hey, you guys coming? - Yep.

764
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,740
好  我们只有一次机会
Okay. We got one shot at this.

765
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,200
只要还有一点水分
If there's any moisture,

766
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,640
电路就会烧坏
the circuits will fry themselves.

767
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,600
开机吧
Turn it on.

768
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,710
有人给我作证吗
Do I have witnesses?

769
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,930
警司科萨克警探
Sergeant detective Korsak

770
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,380
让我开启手机电源
is telling me to turn this phone on.

771
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,570
别废话了赶紧开机  弗罗斯特
Turn the damn phone on, Frost.

772
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,790
我要记录里
I want it in writing

773
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:18,380
清楚地写明如果手机怎么了不是我的责任
that this one is not on me if this phone...

774
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,160
没戏了
It's dead.

775
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,480
你那大米干燥的主意还是没成功
So much for your rice idea.

776
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,370
这是恩佐看过的所有视频清单
This is the whole list of video files Enzo was watching.

777
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,970
能播一下那个吗
Can you play that one?

778
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,850
波士顿剑桥大学队把球传给"达阵"
BCU going for the money with a hand-off to End Zone.

779
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,740
看啊  沃马克冲入强侧  不
Wow! Look at Womack as he breaks to the strong side and -- oh, no!

780
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,100
他起不来了  看上去不妙啊
He's not getting up. Folks, this does not look good.

781
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,720
恩佐看这个干什么
Ugh. Why was Enzo watching that?

782
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,970
你注意到右后卫了吗
You see the right guard?

783
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,220
-是的  -是的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

784
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,080
我没有  你们说什么呢
I didn't. What are you talking about?

785
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,120
再看一遍
Let's see that again.

786
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:58,440
恩佐・沃马克受伤

787
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,780
一向很稳健的右后卫
The normally sure-footed right guard

788
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,610
仿佛滑了一下
looks like he slips on the turf.

789
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,700
然后马丁就冲过来了
And there goes hard-charging Der'on Martin

790
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,930
全速撞击
Flying in at full speed.

791
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,430
恩佐倒下了
Enzo is down! Ouch!

792
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,110
弗罗斯特  放一下周六的比赛片段
Frost, play that clip from Saturday's game.

793
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,830
马库斯接传球跑向右侧
Marcus to the right on a hand-off.

794
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,650
这是怎么回事
Oh! How did that happen?

795
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:16,110
看上去BCU的右后卫滑倒了
Looks like BCU's right guard lost his footing

796
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,840
于是正向后面跑的姐夫・马库斯
and left running back Jeff Marcus

797
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,050
就毫无防备地遭到重击
unprotected for that nasty hit.

798
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,890
这让我想起五年前
Ouch! It reminds me of that hit

799
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,990
断送了恩佐・沃马克职业生涯的那次撞击
that ended Enzo Womack's career five years ago.

800
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,780
我看恩佐被杀的原因已经明朗了
I think we just figured out what got Enzo killed.

801
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,550
这下可不轻啊
Oh! That was a nasty hit.

802
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,930
什么  你们看到什么了
What? What did -- what did you see?

803
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,690
我想知道恩佐为什么被杀
I'd like to know what got Enzo killed.

804
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:50,000
两个BCU的右后卫  相隔五年
Both BCU right guards, who played five years apart,

805
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,010
在同样的赛事做出同样的假摔
faked the same trip on the same play.

806
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,860
为了让他们的反击失败
To make sure their running back got tackled

807
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,010
无法得分
and didn't score.

808
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,180
这简直就像我的微积分考试一样
This is like the day I took that A.P. Calculus exam.

809
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,800
就是打死我  我也做不出
You know, I couldn't have solved that inverse derivative problem

810
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,030
那道反导数的题
if my life depended on it.

811
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,680
别激动  别激动
Calm down. Calm down, okay?

812
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,800
终于轮到我给你上一课了
For once, I get to explain something to you.

813
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,130
弗罗斯特  你能把画面定格到两次假摔上吗
Frost, can you freeze both bad plays?

814
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,060
那个右后卫  还有至少另外一名球员
That right guard and at least one other player --

815
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,270
可能是四分卫  搞砸了2007年的比赛
probably the quarterback -- fixed that game in 2007.

816
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,460
五年之后的这名右后卫
Okay, and that right guard

817
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,910
又做出了同样的动作
fixed the same play five years later.

818
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,790
你是说BCU的球员
Are you saying BCU players

819
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,330
在两个赛季分别放弃了比赛
from two separate seasons threw games?

820
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,260
是操控比赛
Altered games.

821
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,150
如果直接放弃  就太明显了
It's too easy to get caught if you throw them.

822
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,520
如果仅仅是减少得分
If you just shave points...

823
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,820
弗罗斯特  看看两名四分卫
Frost, can we see both quarterbacks?

824
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,270
没错  你们看
Yeah, right there.

825
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,590
BCU 14  西风大学 10

826
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,060
两名四分卫做了同样的手势
Both quarterbacks made identical signals.

827
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,550
看着像  我们要放弃比赛
That says to me, "We're throwing the play."

828
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,580
看他们的眼睛  就在他们拍头盔之前
Watch their eyes right before they tap their helmets.

829
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,070
对  你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

830
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,730
应该有个发令人  他们在看谁
We have a shot caller -- who are they looking at?

831
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,360
弗罗斯特  还有没有其他角度
Frost, do you have any other angles?

832
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,930
恩佐一定是发现了
So, Enzo must have realized

833
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,140
那次结束了他职业生涯的撞击并非偶然
the trip that ended his career wasn't accidental.

834
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,050
但右后卫为什么要假摔呢
But why would the right guard fake a trip?

835
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,260
恩佐是他的队友啊
Enzo was his teammate.

836
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,880
那些踢假球的球员不是想害他
The players who were cheating weren't trying to hurt him.

837
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,670
他们只是不想让他得分
They were just trying to keep him from scoring.

838
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,340
这样就能改变"高低"了
To change the over/under.

839
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,330
-一切都是为了这个  -当然了
- That's what this is about. - Of course.

840
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,610
什么  比什么高低
What? Over/under what?

841
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,560
"高低"是一种赌博
Over/under is a type of bet.

842
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,740
庄家在赛前宣布一个数字
Oddsmakers announce a number before a game.

843
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,520
这个数是他们对双方最终得分之和的猜测
It's their best guess of what the final combined score will be.

844
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,970
我可以赌比这个数高还是低
And I can bet over or under that number.

845
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,580
-没错  -好的  我想我懂了
- Yes. - Okay, I think I understand.

846
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,140
如果两对比分相加
So if the teams' scores, when added together,

847
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,810
比预计的数字低  我就赢了
are lower than predicted, I win.

848
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,620
对
Yes.

849
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,880
如果你知道有不法球员
And if you know that there are dirty players

850
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,560
暗中操控比赛  限制得分
that are fixing the game to keep the score down,

851
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,460
然后再去赌低  你就赢大了
you bet on the under, and then you win big.

852
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,620
没错  但大学球员为什么要作弊呢
Yeah, but why would a college player cheat,

853
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,180
尤其还是这样一所很有名望的大学
especially at a prestigious academic university?

854
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,370
BCU是丙级橄榄球队
Well, BCU is a division III football program.

855
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,970
既没有赞助  也没有奖学金
There's no money, no scholarships.

856
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,310
他们买装备的钱都是靠洗车筹款会弄来的
They're having a car-wash fundraiser to buy equipment.

857
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,660
找到另一个角度了  边线镜头
Got another angle -- sideline camera.

858
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,790
菲利普斯教练是发令人
Coach Phillips is the shot caller.

859
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,240
不对  再放一遍
I don't think so. Play it again.

860
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,760
对  对  对
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

861
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,340
好  同时放2007年和周六的比赛
Okay, play both the 2007 game and Saturday's game.

862
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,550
看麦肯齐
Watch MacKenzie.

863
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,490
看到了吗  两次他都扔毛巾了
You see that? He dropped the towel both times.

864
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,630
恩佐伤口上物质的化验结果出来了
Uh, the results are back on the substance found in Enzo's wounds.

865
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,100
是止痛发热橡胶贴
It's analgesic heat rub.

866
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,940
我发现的纤维来自棉质运动胶带
And the fibers I found were from cotton sports tape.

867
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,320
莫拉
Maura...

868
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,720
你说过凶器应该有个手柄
You said the murder weapon had a hilt?

869
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,220
会不会是一把多功能工具  像这样的
Could it be a multipurpose tool, like this one?

870
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,710
有可能
Yes.

871
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,650
是恩佐的电话吗
Is that Enzo's phone?

872
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,370
你不能抢走修好电话的功劳
Okay, you don't get credit for fixing it.

873
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,850
-给我  -不给
- Give it to me. - No.

874
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,460
我也会看短信
I can look at cellphones, too.

875
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,990
给我  我把它接到大屏幕上
Give it to me and let me plug it in.

876
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,270
谢谢
Thank you.

877
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,800
这是他最后一条短信
Here's his last text message.

878
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,110
发给丹・麦肯齐的  早上7点54分
To Dan MacKenzie, 7:54 A.M.

879
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,620
就在他去洗车之前
Right before he went to the car wash.

880
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,430
我想谈谈  希望是我疯了
"Need to talk. I hope I'm crazy.

881
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,250
我觉得教练让BCU球员故意让球
I think coach has BCU players shaving points."

882
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,670
他以为他的教练作弊
He thought his coach was dirty.

883
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,960
希望是我疯了
"I hope I'm crazy."

884
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,640
不想指控他深爱的球队
We didn't want to accuse the program he loved

885
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,350
除非他确信不疑
unless he was sure he was right.

886
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,560
所以他就去找他最信任的人
So he went to the person he trusted the most --

887
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,850
他的前队友丹・麦肯齐
his former teammate Dan MacKenzie.

888
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,470
不该肿成这样啊
It shouldn't be so swollen.

889
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,060
我说了多少遍  让你做冷敷了
How many times I got to tell you to ice this sucker, huh?

890
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,430
你不能进来  女士止步的
Hey, you can't be in here. There's no women allowed.

891
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,360
BCU刚刚特许我了
BCU just made an exception.

892
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,400
有什么事吗
Well, what's this about?

893
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,630
我们查了你的比赛数据  丹
We checked your stats, Dan.

894
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,100
你以前是个不错的得分手
You were a good field-goal kicker.

895
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,770
但忽然有一天  你就开始射不中了
But suddenly, you started missing.

896
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,240
-是从那时候开始的吧  -开始什么呀
- Was that when it started? - When what started?

897
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,340
你故意射偏  好控制得分
You were missing kicks to shave points.

898
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,830
我听不懂你们在说什么
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

899
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,700
我们在说人的贪欲
We're talking about basic greed.

900
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,860
作为一名年入4万的丙级教练
Living pretty large for a guy making $40,000

901
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,770
你过得还真阔绰啊
as a D-III athletic trainer.

902
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,540
我想请律师
I want a lawyer.

903
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,500
你在大学期间想到了这个阴谋
You came up with this scheme in college,

904
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,990
但你知道恩佐不会踢假球  因为他是个好人

他  他指控球队踢假球
