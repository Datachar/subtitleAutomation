1
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:20,095
Should have responded
to your recall earlier.

2
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,505
You made the right choice.

3
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:23,857
Chance to bury Division?

4
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:25,776
I'm in.
It's what we do.

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,811
Welcome to the winning side.

6
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:37,621
Ops, I got visual
on target.

7
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:39,223
Okay, Nikki, be careful.

8
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:42,493
We don't know what her contact
is armed with.

9
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,027
Relax.

10
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:46,330
I have to warn her.
I have to warn Amanda.

11
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:47,798
No.

12
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:49,299
If she finds out
I didn't warn her,

13
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:50,494
she will trigger
my kill chip,

14
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:51,919
and I will die right here.

15
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:56,373
That's not gonna happen.

16
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:58,726
She's going down.
You're getting free.

17
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:07,884
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,988
I already did.
I had to.

19
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:13,407
Nikki, look out!
It's a trap!

20
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,768
Well, that worked out.

21
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:42,770
Birkhoff.

22
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:44,754
Why didn't you tell me?

23
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:47,775
Because he
didn't trust you.

24
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:50,894
Sonya.

25
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:54,965
I no longer
require your services.

26
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:06,794
No!

27
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:09,913
Sonya!

28
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:12,800
Agh.

29
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,800
Just tell her.

30
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:36,973
Just tell her.

31
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:10,858
I can't breathe, Nikki.

32
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,342
Nerd?

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,646
Are you ever not armed?
Seriously?

34
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,847
Why are you shadowing me?

35
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,816
I had to make sure
nobody else was.

36
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,368
Okay.

37
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,619
You said you felt
like you were being watched

38
00:03:22,654 --> 00:03:24,154
for, like, a month now.

39
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:27,040
Yeah, but I haven't spotted
anyone till now.

40
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:29,459
There's a good reason
for it.

41
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:32,162
Trust me.

42
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:36,366
Sonya is the mole.

43
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:37,367
What?

44
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:38,802
She needs your help.

45
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:40,671
About three weeks ago,

46
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:42,389
Amanda's cleaner grabbed her
coming out of her apartment.

47
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,892
They reactivated
her kill chip.

48
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,227
Now if she doesn't update them
every two hours,

49
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:49,680
she's considered compromised.

50
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:51,381
She couldn't take ten minutes
to ask for help?

51
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,900
We can remove her chip
in medical.

52
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:56,553
No, no, no,
there's a second mole.

53
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,822
Someone whose sole job
it is to watch her,

54
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:02,442
make sure she stays
in line.

55
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:09,733
She has access to you,
to us.

56
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,402
Yeah, Amanda wants her
to focus on personal dirt.

57
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,404
She doesn't care
about the missions.

58
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,674
She's playing
the long game.

59
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,712
She wants to see me suffer.

60
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:23,597
You did the right thing
telling me.

61
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,183
But we--we gotta tell
the others.

62
00:04:26,217 --> 00:04:27,601
No, no, no, no, no, no.

63
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,853
I told Sonya that--

64
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:31,254
Listen,
I'll keep it quiet.

65
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:35,425
Trust me, I promise.

66
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,060
Okay.

67
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:40,480
In the meantime,
make sure Sonya plays along.

68
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,604
Most wanted.

69
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:50,574
That's what I like to hear.

70
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:52,793
How do you know
she isn't playing you?

71
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:55,796
Do I detect a hint
of jealousy, Anne?

72
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,632
No.
Suspicion.

73
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,634
Why do you trust Sonya?

74
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,919
She has an explosive
in her brainstem

75
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:05,389
that I have on speed dial.

76
00:05:05,423 --> 00:05:06,956
Who needs trust?

77
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:08,892
As long as you know
when to use it.

78
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,744
Let's check
the weather then.

79
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:16,233
Partially cloudy
but still a balmy 78.

80
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,234
You see?

81
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:19,102
Wailea Beach?

82
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:21,905
If our friend
on the inside

83
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:24,324
senses Sonya
is flirting with betrayal,

84
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,999
the forecast
on this weather site changes,

85
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:30,647
and I retire Sonya.

86
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:34,150
This must be what it felt like
to be Nikita.

87
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,086
On the run
from place to place,

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,005
launching her war
from a laptop

89
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,923
with a mole inside Division.

90
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:43,093
She lives
inside stronger walls now.

91
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:45,429
But in a way,
she's weaker than ever.

92
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:49,266
Even the strongest walls
can come crashing down.

93
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,971
All you need to find is
a single crack on the surface.

94
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:04,180
- Hey.
- Hey.

95
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,450
What are you doing here?

96
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:08,518
It's a nice day.
I took a walk.

97
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,186
Yeah.

98
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,988
It's a little warm to wear
that jacket, huh?

99
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:14,791
Not really.
Were you following me?

100
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:16,960
- Should I be?
- No.

101
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:19,963
I--I just--
lately I've been feeling

102
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:21,531
like someone's
been watching me.

103
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,383
We all have.

104
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:26,002
We're letting
Amanda's mind games get to us.

105
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:29,389
Or maybe you just took
too many of these.

106
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:33,643
Sobelex, huh?

107
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:36,063
I thought I saw the signs
on you a few days ago.

108
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:37,347
Give it back,
Michael.

109
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:39,649
Why?
They're not yours.

110
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:41,551
They're Division's.

111
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,720
It's an experimental painkiller

112
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:45,238
designed for combat use,

113
00:06:45,273 --> 00:06:47,223
not recommended
for ex-drug addicts.

114
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,992
I was only taking it
for my shoulder.

115
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:51,411
I wanted to help out.
Help?

116
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:54,197
This doesn't just put
your life in danger, Alex.

117
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:56,500
This puts my life
in danger.

118
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:58,085
Nikita's.

119
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:00,370
And anyone who relies on you
to shoot straight

120
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:02,005
and back them up
in the field.

121
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,008
I do.

122
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,377
- It's Nikita.
- Okay, look, Michael.

123
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:09,713
Look, you're right, okay?
I'll stop, I'll stop.

124
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:12,466
Just please don't tell Nikita.
Please.

125
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,920
Hey.

126
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:22,025
I'm on my way.

127
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:24,060
We're needed
back at the office.

128
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:25,779
- Thank you.
- Don't.

129
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,598
I made the decision
to talk to you before Nikita

130
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:31,785
because this would hurt her
more than anyone,

131
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,455
on account of everything
she's gone through for you.

132
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,625
So you are gonna be
the one that tells her.

133
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,210
And in the meantime,
you're gonna clean up,

134
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:41,545
and you're not going
back out into the field

135
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:43,296
until that happens.

136
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,881
What did Nikita want?

137
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:51,138
Looks like we're both
gonna find out.

138
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:54,891
All right, people,
we need to up our game.

139
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:56,426
Let's close the net.

140
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,295
Now we know
that she was in Luxembourg

141
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,930
three weeks back

142
00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:02,149
and Andalusia six days ago.

143
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:05,468
We need to figure out
where she's going next.

144
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,604
Let's go!

145
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:10,774
Sonya, where's the list
of her confiscated inventory?

146
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:12,141
Almost done.

147
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,994
We need it now.
Bring it into briefing.

148
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,363
Yes, sir.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,483
That should buy us
some time.

150
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,818
You call that believable?

151
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,620
"Okay, people,
we need to up our game."

152
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:25,505
Birkhoff, calm down.

153
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:33,463
It sounded fake.

154
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:35,331
We should be doing this
in Ryan's office anyway.

155
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,766
Then I couldn't be here.

156
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,167
Your fake inventory, sir.

157
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:39,836
Are you sure
there's a second mole?

158
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,688
No, but I can't take
the risk.

159
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,690
Let's start going over
our options.

160
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,642
Surgery, remove the chip.

161
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:48,111
We lost our best surgeon
in Amanda's attack on medical.

162
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,696
Surgery takes
six hours minimum.

163
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,314
And I have to check in
every two.

164
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:53,550
Which rules out a trip
to an outside hospital as well.

165
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:55,368
Why can't someone else
check in for you?

166
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:57,153
The second mole would see
and alert Amanda.

167
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,025
What about deactivation?

168
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,793
Three hours.
Laparoscopic procedure.

169
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:05,128
Portable equipment.

170
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:06,830
Still gotta buy
the extra hour.

171
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:08,531
Wait, didn't Amanda
deactivate your kill chip once?

172
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,716
How'd that work?

173
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,134
She electrocuted me.

174
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,220
I was clinically deceased
for 32 seconds.

175
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:14,638
It fooled the chip.

176
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:17,057
I'm not getting killed
to save my life.

177
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:19,226
I have to get back
to my station.

178
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,394
Wait, there is another way.

179
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:22,879
We kill the threat
at its source.

180
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,047
We kill Amanda.

181
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,549
How?

182
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,900
She relies on you for intel.
We set a trap.

183
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,151
End this for good.

184
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:29,552
No, no, no, no, no.

185
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,887
That means leaving
her kill chip active.

186
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,322
This is about
how we deactivate it.

187
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:33,740
But this could be the only w--

188
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,575
No!

189
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,911
No, we're not risking
her life any further.

190
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,562
It's not your life,
Seymour.

191
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,164
It's mine.

192
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:42,749
Everyone in here
is trying to save me,

193
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,367
and all I've done
is jeopardize your lives

194
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,036
by not asking
for help sooner.

195
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:50,807
Besides, I want revenge
for what she's done to me.

196
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,845
Let's bait the bitch.

197
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,099
I knew I liked her.

201
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:49,759
Not interested.

202
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:54,996
Better step it up, honey,
or it's die time.

203
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:00,918
You wanted to see me?

204
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,202
Yeah.

205
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:04,171
Yes, I did.

206
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:08,977
What do you think?

207
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:11,629
It's nice.

208
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:13,798
Nice?

209
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:16,101
Ahem.

210
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,770
This is
a hydraulic battering ram

211
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,805
with spike deployment.

212
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:23,441
We've got N.O.S. booster,

213
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,810
onboard radar,
oil slick.

214
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:27,245
See those headlights
right there?

215
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,814
They launch
laser-guided missiles.

216
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:31,249
Really?

217
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,167
No, but how cool would that be
if they did?

218
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:34,802
That's why we all
gotta get on board

219
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:36,504
and convince Ryan
it's worth spending the cash.

220
00:11:36,538 --> 00:11:38,723
Michael, spare me
the Psych 101, okay?

221
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:40,797
Well, she's all you ever
talk about at home, here.

222
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:44,634
It's always about Amanda.
I'm getting sick of this--

223
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:46,085
Awkward.

224
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,887
We were just leaving.

225
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:51,115
Yeah, we were.

226
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:54,936
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

227
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:56,237
We can't get
a moment alone in here.

228
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:57,128
Is this what's wrong,

229
00:11:57,129 --> 00:11:58,746
or is there something else
bothering you?

230
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,432
Why does there need
to be something else?

231
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:03,268
Because lately it feels like
you're holding back,

232
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:04,853
you're suppressing something.
No, no, no.

233
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:06,187
The only one
who's holding back is you.

234
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:07,255
You are holding us back.

235
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:08,857
Once we got rid of Percy,

236
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,525
we were supposed
to be done with this place,

237
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,860
but now with your obsession--
What? No! No!

238
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:13,594
Yes, yes,
with your obsession,

239
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:15,196
you are blind to the problem
in front of you.

240
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,781
What?

241
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,233
Are we done yet?

242
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:19,767
The camera stopped
ten seconds ago.

243
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:21,769
I just didn't want you
to break character.

244
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:25,373
Are we sure
this is gonna work?

245
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:27,876
You and me fighting,
Amanda catnip.

246
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,579
Okay, I will compress
and upload the video to her,

247
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:34,249
and then I will tell her that
Michael has gone off to the pub

248
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:35,917
to drown his sorrows
in drink.

249
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:37,585
No, send the video,

250
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:39,087
let it marinate,
and then on your next update,

251
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:40,722
let her know where Michael
will be drinking.

252
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:42,891
And we're positive
Amanda's gonna show up?

253
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:44,442
I don't know,
could be she sends Anne.

254
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:46,327
She sends Anne,
we follow her to Amanda.

255
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:47,595
Either way,
we have to plant the bait,

256
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:48,813
so let's get started.

257
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:51,799
We're on a schedule, go.

258
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:55,320
Hey, guys,
I just wanted to say

259
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:56,988
how much it means to me--

260
00:12:57,022 --> 00:12:58,907
Hey, Nerd,
can we do this later?

261
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:00,325
You have
another mole to I.D.

262
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:02,243
Ryan and Alex are waiting,
phase two.

263
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:03,244
- Right, cool.
- Great.

264
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,613
You're awesome.

265
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:08,249
What?

266
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:10,452
Let's not fight like that.

267
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:13,121
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

268
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,803
Phase two, whac-a-mole.

269
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:32,307
All right, people.

270
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:34,175
Everybody listen up.

271
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,661
We've got our first lead
on Amanda.

272
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:40,031
With your help,
we can finish this.

273
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:41,616
Alex is gonna bring you
up to speed.

274
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,201
Based on our intel,

275
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:44,719
we believe Amanda
has a safe house

276
00:13:44,753 --> 00:13:46,955
within a 2-mile radius
of Hofgarten.

277
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:48,823
I want everyone
to pool their resources

278
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:50,542
and do whatever you can

279
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:53,211
to close the circle
even further.

280
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:06,541
Okay, stations
2, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 13.

281
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,709
That many people spiked
at the mention of Amanda?

282
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:11,346
Yeah, now let's narrow it down
even further.

283
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,714
See who reacts
to Sonya reacting.

284
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:18,937
Go.

285
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:35,787
And then there were four.

286
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:39,374
Better get going
and prep the next phase.

287
00:14:39,408 --> 00:14:41,709
On it.

288
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,823
Ops, we're a go.

289
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:14,776
Is this what's wrong,

290
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,411
or is there something else
bothering you?

291
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:18,129
Okay, why does there need
to be something else?

292
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:20,548
Because lately it feels
like you're holding back.

293
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,217
Do you see what I see?

294
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,419
I see
why you forbid relationships

295
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:26,287
when you were running
Division.

296
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:29,424
Nikita is perceptive.
Michael is hiding something.

297
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,961
And I have an idea
what it might be.

298
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:39,601
Well, it's all
coming together

299
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:41,436
or falling apart.

300
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,904
Contact the Watchman.

301
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:44,906
Tell him I have
another assignment for him.

302
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,941
I don't understand
how he gets so close

303
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:48,576
to take these pictures.

304
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:50,161
We all have our specialty.

305
00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:52,580
You have your knife.
The Watchman has his eye.

306
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:56,501
I find the cracks
on the surface.

307
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:01,339
Anything yet?

308
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:03,508
She should have responded
by now.

309
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:05,009
What if she knows?

310
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:07,128
She doesn't.

311
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:11,499
Wait.

312
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:14,969
Dealtown Shoe Outlet?

313
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:17,672
Amanda encodes her orders
on regular websites

314
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,124
using steganography.

315
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:34,706
Why would Amanda have Sonya
watching the two of you?

316
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,374
She must have had
someone following us.

317
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:38,209
Us?
Both of you?

318
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:40,962
We ran into each other
this morning.

319
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:43,548
Michael, stop.

320
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,489
Nikita, a couple weeks ago,
I started using again.

321
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:53,541
What?

322
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,310
Michael found out
and confronted me.

323
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:56,511
She was supposed
to tell you.

324
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:57,679
She was supposed to?

325
00:16:57,713 --> 00:16:59,130
But it wasn't
the right time.

326
00:16:59,164 --> 00:17:01,316
This thing with Sonya--
Wait, using what?

327
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,055
Sobelex for my arm.

328
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,391
It helped me retrieve
the cryptograph, okay?

329
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,527
No, if I had told you,
you would have had me benched.

330
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:13,561
You're damn right
I would have.

331
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,829
Nikita--

332
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:16,230
No, you I understand
even less.

333
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:17,865
A member of our team
is unstable,

334
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:19,400
and you don't warn me,
you don't warn Ryan?

335
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:20,835
I wanted to avoid
this type of overreaction.

336
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,537
Overreaction?
She is an addict, Michael.

337
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:24,372
All right.
Guys, guys, stop.

338
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:25,673
Listen to yourselves.

339
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,908
Okay, this is
what Amanda wants,

340
00:17:27,926 --> 00:17:29,427
the lies, the blame.

341
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:31,346
Fracture.

342
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,097
Birkhoff's right, we set out
to fake a fight for Amanda,

343
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:34,749
and here we are
in a real one.

344
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,684
Well, this was my fault,
so I'll stand down.

345
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,753
No.

346
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:40,438
We are going to adjust,

347
00:17:40,472 --> 00:17:44,091
and we are going to work
with what we have.

348
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:47,094
We have confirmation
that Amanda is tailing us.

349
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:48,696
We've suspected it
for weeks.

350
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:50,014
I didn't see anyone,
and I was looking.

351
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:51,282
If you were surveilled,

352
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:52,850
it had to be
at extremely long range.

353
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:56,454
Or extremely close.

354
00:17:56,488 --> 00:17:59,073
Amanda has another rogue
on her side.

355
00:17:59,107 --> 00:18:01,909
Oh, sit.
The Watchman.

356
00:18:01,943 --> 00:18:03,711
Who's the Watchman?

357
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:04,879
He's a Division legend

358
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:06,914
and now our ticket
to Amanda.

359
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:09,584
She thinks something's going on
between the two of you.

360
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:12,637
Let's give the lady
what she wants.

361
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:22,156
Excellent work
on the last batch of photos.

362
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:24,747
Exactly the kind of intel
I was looking for.

363
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:26,549
Doesn't come cheap.

364
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,900
Stay with Michael and Alex.

365
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:29,735
Don't worry
about Nikita for now.

366
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:31,506
Whatever's happening
between the two of them

367
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:33,172
is more important.

368
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:35,374
I'll begin as soon
as the money hits my account.

369
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:36,992
Already on its way.

370
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:40,162
This was taken
from a park cam earlier today.

371
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:43,532
Here's me and Alex,
and here's the Watchman.

372
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,501
How can you be sure
that's him?

373
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:47,036
Because we had Birkhoff
run his facial recog program

374
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,771
through all
the surrounding cameras.

375
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:51,073
He was able to track
everyone from the coffee cart

376
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:52,424
about 12 blocks.

377
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:53,676
This guy vanished in one.

378
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,894
Vanished?

379
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:56,712
That's his specialty.

380
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,764
The Watchman was Division's
close surveillance expert.

381
00:18:58,815 --> 00:19:00,766
He was able to change
his appearance

382
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:03,519
at a moment's notice,
he made it a habit.

383
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:05,237
His job was
to surveil a target

384
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:07,106
without making them aware
they were even being followed.

385
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:09,909
Only Percy and Amanda
knew his name

386
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:12,661
and what he really
looked like.

387
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:16,732
- What's in his file?
- Never had one.

388
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,084
His other job was
to investigate Division agents.

389
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,420
He did routine checks
on everyone,

390
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:23,305
observed them
in their cover lives

391
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,980
and made sure
they didn't break any rules.

392
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:27,927
Which is why he only
reported to Percy and Amanda.

393
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,878
He's about to write
his last report.

394
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:32,381
I'm still not sure
about this.

395
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:34,249
You want Michael and I
to pretend

396
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:35,768
to rendezvous
in some nightclub.

397
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:37,919
Sonya will feed
the address to Amanda.

398
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:39,321
This is a photo op.

399
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:41,390
Wherever you go,
the Watchman will follow,

400
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:42,641
and I will follow him.

401
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:44,092
When he makes contact
with Amanda,

402
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,728
we trace his communications

403
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:47,146
and zero her location.

404
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:48,647
Now what
about the second mole?

405
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:50,099
They're still in play.

406
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,951
Birkhoff's got that
under control.

407
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:55,287
Okay, people, look alive.

408
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,122
What are we doing
down here?

409
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:59,458
What's with
all the questions?

410
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:03,128
So Halon system went off,

411
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:05,831
covered the tower,
fried eight of the nodes.

412
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:07,583
- Did it malfunction?
- No.

413
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:09,752
Our fire prevention system
suddenly became self-aware

414
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:14,173
and decided to attack us
with whipped cream.

415
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,475
That's a joke.

416
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:18,761
Anyway, people, the point
is we're in the middle

417
00:20:18,795 --> 00:20:20,295
of the hunt for Amanda.

418
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:22,348
We need to be up and running
at full capacity.

419
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,683
So I want each of you
to choose two nodes

420
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:26,485
and rebuild them
from the ground up.

421
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,320
What?
That'll take hours.

422
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:30,189
Then you better stop whining
and get to work.

423
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,276

until the job's done.

00:27:47,052 --> 00:27:48,786
Yeah, Amanda
knows how to hurt us

535
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:50,304
more than anyone else.

536
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:53,624
I know that I won't be able
to breathe easy

537
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:55,476
until she's gone.

538
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,961
I just have this feeling
that something's gonna happen.

539
00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:01,932
Something.

540
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:03,150
To Sonya?

541
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:08,189
Hey.

542
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,975
Nikita, we can't control
the future.

543
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:14,145
What's important is,
whatever happens,

544
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:17,448
we face it together.

545
00:28:17,482 --> 00:28:19,417
That's all
that matters to me.

546
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:26,757
Let's finish this.

547
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:06,414
We can't wait.

548
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:08,082
We can't wait any longer.

549
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,700
We've got to start
this thing now.

550
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:11,252
Nikita and Michael
aren't in position yet.

551
00:29:11,303 --> 00:29:13,337
They're an hour outside
Amanda's location.

552
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:14,588
Deactivation takes
three hours.

553
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,373
Let's get this thing going.

554
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:17,558
Okay, we haven't I.D.'ed
the second mole yet.

555
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:18,926
We can't wait for that.

556
00:29:18,977 --> 00:29:20,711
What if the mole
has a check-in time?

557
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:22,212
We don't know.

558
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,931
We don't even know
if the mole is real.

559
00:29:23,982 --> 00:29:25,900
All I know,
the kill chip is active.

560
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:27,852
I need to make it
the other way.

561
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:29,069
Where do you want
to do this?

562
00:29:29,104 --> 00:29:31,054
Sublevel 12.

563
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:33,107
Whoa,
Amanda's old torture room?

564
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:35,292
Yeah, nobody goes down there.
We won't be bothered.

565
00:29:35,327 --> 00:29:37,611
How long will our suspects
be occupied?

566
00:29:37,662 --> 00:29:40,064
Four hours, tops.

567
00:29:44,903 --> 00:29:46,737
Do it.

568
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:48,238
If anyone leaves,
I'll deal with them.

569
00:29:48,256 --> 00:29:51,759
I've got your back.

570
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,586
Okay, I'm freaking out.

571
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:08,421
Why are you
not freaking out?

572
00:30:08,456 --> 00:30:09,706
I don't see
how that would help.

573
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,074
I'm focusing on the plan.

574
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:16,096
There's gotta be another way
we can do this

575
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,598
that doesn't involve
risking your life.

576
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:21,701
We've already narrowed down
the list of suspects to four.

577
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,470
They're under surveillance.

578
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:27,423
So you can finally disable
this damn thing in my head.

579
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:30,443
How can you be so sure
this is gonna work?

580
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:33,930
I'm about to let you poke
at my brain with a needle.

581
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:39,953
Apparently I trust you.

582
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:48,611
Okay, come on.

583
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:53,883
Make yourself comfortable.

584
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:02,008
Okay, just lean forward.

585
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:06,479
Just like that.

586
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,602
Looks scary.

587
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,822
Actually,
it's a very, uh...

588
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:18,692
A simple procedure.

589
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,143
Okay.

590
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:22,028
Now just relax.

591
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,665
Just...

592
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,667
stay calm.

593
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:31,137
Take deep breaths.

594
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,119
Okay, now this is just
a local anesthetic.

595
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:47,887
A slight pinch.

596
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:06,072
Gonna need you to hold
very still.

597
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:07,857
Whatever you say,
Dr. Birkhoff.

598
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,028
I'm supposed to keep
asking you questions

599
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:15,582
to make sure your brain's
functioning properly.

600
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:19,886
I think the sarcasm quadrant
is working just fine.

601
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,572
Ask away.

602
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:24,040
Are you serious?

603
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,493
Anything to distract me.

604
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,428
Okay.

605
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,231
Um...

606
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:34,234
What are you gonna be
for Halloween this year?

607
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:35,902
A princess.

608
00:32:35,936 --> 00:32:38,705
Oh, a princess, huh?

609
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,056
Leia?

610
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,575
Zelda.

611
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,961
I knew
you were gonna be Zelda.

612
00:32:44,995 --> 00:32:47,230
Well,
then why'd you say Leia?

613
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:48,748
Because it distracted you.

614
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:51,117
Didn't it?

615
00:32:51,168 --> 00:32:53,420
Hard part's over.

616
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,431
Agh, damn it!

617
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:25,568
Stupid cart.

618
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:27,620
That looks serious.

619
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:42,051
- I'm gonna go to medical.
- Right.

620
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:51,644
Server room.

621
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,480
Yes, this is Alex.
Is Baker there?

622
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:54,630
I've got a question.

623
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:56,766
You just missed him.

624
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,134
He's headed to medical.

625
00:33:58,152 --> 00:34:00,803
Accidentally cut himself.

626
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,485
Did Baker come by here?

627
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:31,351
I don't see anything.

628
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:33,669
Movement, second left.

629
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:38,141
Ah.

630
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:40,026
Now I can't get
a clear shot.

631
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,678
We're gonna have to go inside,
up close and personal.

632
00:34:42,696 --> 00:34:44,731
We can't risk breach until
Sonya's chip is deactivated.

633
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,149
Birkhoff,
how is she?

634
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:48,768
47% and climbing.

635
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:53,239
You always did like
the recruits, didn't you?

636
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,358
Your friend Marcel
contacted Ari.

637
00:34:55,376 --> 00:34:57,160
He's willing to meet,
but only if you're there.

638
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:58,978
- Where?
- Serbia.

639
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,713
I've got a Netjet waiting
for you at the local airport.

640
00:35:00,748 --> 00:35:02,882
I hate Serbia.

641
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:05,885
But at least I'll get
some work done on the plane.

642
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:27,723
Lost?

643
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:30,059
Cut myself.

644
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:31,394
Going to medical.

645
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:33,329
You're about 12 floors off.

646
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,400
What does Amanda have on you?

647
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:40,736
What does she have?

648
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:45,241
She has my loyalty.
She's always had it.

649
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:48,294
You're the traitor here,
and traitors die.

650
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,518
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

651
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:07,730
What the hell's
going on out there?

652
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,148
It was Baker
in the server room

653
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,316
with the candlestick.

654
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:12,318
Baker, really?
Dude had skills.

655
00:36:12,353 --> 00:36:14,070
I never liked him.

656
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:15,571
Guy was a douche bag.

657
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:17,991
You should call Nikki,
tell her the good news.

658
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,158
Is it green for Amanda?

659
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:22,295
We're at 72%.

660
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:23,913
So the mole is down,
but the chip is active?

661
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:25,915
- Correct.
- Where are we at?

662
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:29,419
- 72%.
- Minutes, Alex.

663
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,071
Nikita.

664
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,923
B, how many minutes?

665
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:35,141
Eh, five, six?

666
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:36,342
Five or six.

667
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:37,626
Is it five, or is it six?

668
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:40,296
Nikita, look.

669
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:43,299
She's out of pocket.

670
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:44,600
Change of plan.
She's on the move.

671
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:45,818
We're on the move.
Damn it.

672
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:02,803
- You're too close.
- We can't lose her.

673
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,681
That's strange.

674
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,534
The weather inside Division
hasn't changed at all.

675
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,119
That's good, right?

676
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,805
I mean, there's been
no refresh in the data,

677
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,240
no update at all.

678
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:40,757
It's done.
It's done?

679
00:37:40,808 --> 00:37:42,759
Seymour?

680
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,045
You're safe.

681
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,047
Nikita, chip is down.

682
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,765
We're green to strike.

683
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,644
It's Nikita.

684
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:35,595
How did she--

685
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,769
Birkhoff!

686
00:38:58,286 --> 00:38:59,503
What are you doing?

687
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:01,305
They're shooting at us.

688
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,673
Wait!

689
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,143
Grenade!

690
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,494
Anne, stop.

691
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,829
Do not kill her.

692
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,648
Michael.

693
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,367
Are you okay?

694
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:33,287
My arm's stuck.

695
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,404
Anne!

696
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,545
Nikita, just go.

697
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,964
No, the tank's gonna blow.

698
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:10,384
I know, I want you to live.
Just go, please.

699
00:41:10,418 --> 00:41:12,585
I love you.
Damn it, just go!

700
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,089
I love you.

701
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:34,607
Aghh!

702
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:41,081
Michael.

703
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:43,667
We gotta go,
it's gonna blow.

704
