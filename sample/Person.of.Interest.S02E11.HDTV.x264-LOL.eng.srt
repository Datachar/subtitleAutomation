has a secret system...

A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

4
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,429
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

5
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:14,781
but it sees everything...

6
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:18,534
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

7
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:21,320
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

8
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:23,539
We don't.

9
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:27,960

we work in secret.

This is

There's been an accident.

17
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:47,413
I couldn't stop the train
in time,

18
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:48,797

You know,
in the late 18th century,

76
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,575
there was a math prodigy
named Carl Friedrich Gauss

77

with the same tedious problem

00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:17,989
And quantum physics
notwithstanding,

535
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:19,758
he can't be
in two places at once.

536
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,877
Unless I'm right,
and this kid's got a plan,

537
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,962
time's running out
on two fronts.

538
00:28:23,964 --> 00:28:25,714
Maybe skipping town's
the best thing for him.

539
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:28,266
Then we could focus some on
getting your pal out of lockup.

540
00:28:28,268 --> 00:28:29,834
Mr. Reese can take care
of himself, Detective.

541
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:33,105
And right now,
he's in very capable hands.

542
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:34,689
Detective Carter,

543
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:37,275
time is ticking away fast
for our friend in Rikers.

544
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:40,345
Don't worry.
I know what to do.

545
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:46,511
[Over computer]
Here you go.

546
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:51,266
Mm. Sorry, honey.

547
00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:52,968
I'll be better tomorrow.

548
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,754
I promise.

549
00:29:58,441 --> 00:30:00,859
Yeah.

550
00:30:00,861 --> 00:30:05,096
Everything's gonna
be better tomorrow, ma.

551
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,367
Detective Fusco.

552
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:12,237
I just want to remind you
that I need your help tonight.

553
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:14,272
Caleb has two appointments,

554
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:17,042
and we have no idea which one
he intends to keep.

555
00:30:17,044 --> 00:30:20,078
I'll be there.

556
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,963
You wanted to speak with me?

557
00:30:21,965 --> 00:30:24,716
Yeah, have a seat,
officer Murphy.

558
00:30:24,718 --> 00:30:29,387
Like I said, I'm, uh...
Working on a cold case.

559
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:30,972
Commuter got pushed.

560
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:33,341
Looking for related cases,
this popped up.

561
00:30:33,343 --> 00:30:34,593
Ryan Phipps.

562
00:30:34,595 --> 00:30:36,461
Says here you were first
on the scene?

563
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:38,513
Yeah, that's right.

564
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:41,349
Kid was six months shy
of his 18th birthday.

565
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:43,084
Coming home
with his little brother Caleb.

566
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:45,937
Ryan was horsing around,
drinking a little bit.

567
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:48,073
Slipped on the tracks
and got clipped.

568
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:49,474
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

569
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:51,993
It was a rough one.

570
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:53,945
Because it was a kid?

571
00:30:53,947 --> 00:30:57,815
Or because you didn't report
the whole story?

572
00:30:57,817 --> 00:31:02,587
I know about the kids
who pushed Ryan on the tracks.

573
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:07,292
I'm no Detective, Detective.

574
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:09,678
I'm just a lowly transit cop.

575
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,097
I seen a lot of things
in my time.

576
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:14,466
And I made a lot
of decisions I regret.

577
00:31:14,468 --> 00:31:16,501
This is not one of those times.

578
00:31:16,503 --> 00:31:18,470
You may regret it
when Caleb becomes a killer.

579
00:31:18,472 --> 00:31:20,021
What are you talking about?

580
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:21,723
You think revenge is gonna
make Caleb feel better

581
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:23,341
about seeing his brother die?

582
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:25,694
You're a long ways off,
Detective.

583
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,480
Then give me some directions.

584
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:29,731
You know, I did to the kid

585
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:32,817
what you're doing
to me right now.

586
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:34,736
When I asked him
for descriptions

587
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:41,192
of the other kids...
Kept changing it up.

588
00:31:41,194 --> 00:31:42,210
There were no other kids.

589
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:44,079
[Quietly]
No.

590
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:48,500
Just two brothers drinking.

591
00:31:48,502 --> 00:31:49,751
Bored.

592
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:53,088
Waiting for a train
to go home.

593
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:57,842
So they dare each other
to, uh... cross the tracks.

594
00:31:57,844 --> 00:32:01,546
You know, how many times
you can cross back and forth

595
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:04,182
before a train comes?

596
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:07,736
Well, Ryan doesn't want to lose
to his little brother.

597
00:32:07,738 --> 00:32:12,107
One kid makes it,
the other kid doesn't.

598
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:17,195
I don't know
who got the better deal.

599
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:22,000
So I told him I'd leave all that
out of the report,

600
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:23,335
write it up as an accident,

601
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:26,471
and for him
to keep it to himself.

602
00:32:26,473 --> 00:32:29,457
So no matter what he had
to tell his mom...

603
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:34,129
Or the cops,
or God himself...

604
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:37,749
Nothing was gonna bring
his brother back.

605
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:39,351
What can I tell you?

606
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:44,055
Some things you can't fix.

607
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:49,661
[Cell phone rings]

608
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:51,446
[Beep]

609
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:53,815
Hey, I just talked
to Murphy.

610
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:55,450
The brother's death
was an accident,

611
00:32:55,452 --> 00:32:57,535
but it sounds like
Caleb blames himself for it.

612
00:32:57,537 --> 00:32:59,070
Well, that's a problem,
Detective,

613
00:32:59,072 --> 00:33:00,789
because I lost Caleb.

614
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,774
He got on a city bus, and it
left before I could catch up.

615
00:33:02,776 --> 00:33:04,626
You're kidding me.

616
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:06,628
May I remind you that of the
many things I'm equipped to do,

617
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,380
pursuit would not be chief
among them.

618
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:10,114
Our only option now
is to wait for Caleb

619
00:33:10,116 --> 00:33:12,467
at the two places
he's likeliest to turn up.

620
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:14,118
I'll stake out beckner
at the High School.

621
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,046
You keep an eye out
for our aggrieved drug dealer.

622
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:28,349
Get everyone,
and hunt that kid down!

623
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:30,735
[Line dials]

624
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:33,354
Our boy is a no-show,
and Lorenzo wants his head.

625
00:33:33,356 --> 00:33:34,539
You worry about the kid.

626
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:36,491
I'll take care of Lorenzo.

627
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,144
[Panting] He's
not here either, Detective.

628
00:33:40,146 --> 00:33:44,413
I may be too late.

629
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:48,503
Swift,
what are you doing here?

630
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:49,987
I was gonna ask you the same.

631
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:51,456
- I-I left some papers on...
- Stop it!

632
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,041
I saw you break
into Caleb's account

633
00:33:53,043 --> 00:33:54,492
and copy his files.

634
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:56,294
Is that what you're willing
to stoop to?

635
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:59,292
Stealing the work of a student
and passing it off as your own?

636
00:33:59,293 --> 00:34:00,715
I am not gonna stand here

637
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:02,667
and be accused of plagiarism
by some substitute teacher.

638
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:05,637
Besides, why would I copy work
off of a "C"-grade student?

639
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:08,917
Because Caleb
is anything but average.

640
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:10,809
And you know it.

641
00:34:10,811 --> 00:34:16,231
That's why you took his work
to your friend.

642
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:20,852
Caleb... Approached
me a few months ago

643
00:34:20,854 --> 00:34:23,571
about this project
he was working on.

644
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:27,024
I was skeptical,
but when I... saw his code

645
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:28,877
I couldn't believe my eyes,
so I decided to help him.

646
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,462
- By cutting him out of it.
- No.

647
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:31,830
All he wanted was
some money up front

648
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:33,298
for this trip that he wants
to take.

649
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,666
Said he didn't even want
any credit.

650
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:36,417
Why on earth
would you agree to that?

651
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:39,337
I didn't.

652
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,259
Read it for yourself.

653
00:34:44,261 --> 00:34:47,044
Caleb gets all the credit.

654
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:48,730
It was just easier for me to...

655
00:34:48,732 --> 00:34:51,015
Pitch the idea
with him myself...

656
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:53,401
Get some capital...

657
00:34:53,403 --> 00:34:55,436
And then reveal
the true brain behind it.

658
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:57,772
He offered me half
if I put the other half

659
00:34:57,774 --> 00:35:00,825
in a trust that he set up
for his mom.

660
00:35:00,827 --> 00:35:03,661
But I'm giving him
the whole thing.

661
00:35:03,663 --> 00:35:06,731
All the money from 17-6-21.

662
00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:08,500
17-6-21?

663
00:35:08,502 --> 00:35:10,335
It's the name
he gave the program.

664
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:12,036
He said it was some kind
of dedication.

665
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:14,589
Look, I am telling you,
six months from now,

666
00:35:14,591 --> 00:35:16,591
Caleb is going
to be the richest 18-year-old

667
00:35:16,593 --> 00:35:18,877
in the country.

668
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:22,079
No.

669
00:35:22,081 --> 00:35:24,539
No, he won't.

670
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,214
Dispatch?
Officer Murphy,

671
00:35:36,216 --> 00:35:37,632
regarding the subway fatality.

672
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:39,400
1080
on the backup request.

673
00:35:39,402 --> 00:35:41,586
10-5, officer.
Cancel backup request?

674
00:35:41,588 --> 00:35:43,555
Affirmative.

675
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:59,616
This seat taken?

676
00:36:12,284 --> 00:36:13,918
What are you doing here?

677
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,803
You're so smart, Caleb.

678
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:19,807
Ask me something you <i>don't</i> know.

679
00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:25,045
The thing
about being reckless...

680
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:27,231
Taking chances...

681
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:28,933
Is that you make
a lot of mistakes,

682
00:36:28,935 --> 00:36:30,401
cause a lot of grief.

683
00:36:30,403 --> 00:36:34,021
Gonna start lecturing me
on mistakes?

684
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:36,574
How I need to live and learn?

685
00:36:36,576 --> 00:36:39,110
Move on?

686
00:36:39,112 --> 00:36:42,163
That's really inspiring,
Mr. Swift.

687
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:46,167
I'd stand up on my desk
and clap for you.

688
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:51,539
But... No.

689
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,541
Your mistakes, like mine,

690
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:55,459
are part of who you are now.

691
00:36:55,461 --> 00:36:59,913
You can't move on from that.

692
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:01,415
Believe me.

693
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:04,751
I've made a sizable number.

694
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:10,107
But... Sometimes your
mistakes can surprise you.

695
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:15,796
My biggest mistake,
for instance...

696
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:17,531
Brought me here.

697
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:19,417
At exactly this moment...

698
00:37:19,419 --> 00:37:22,769
When you might need some help.

699
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:28,042
17 years, 6 months
and 21 days into your life.

700
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:30,628
The age
at which your brother died.

701
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:35,132
The age you've chosen
to end your life too.

702
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:39,870
17-6-21.

703
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:49,180
So, you see... Maybe you
and I are connected.

704
00:37:49,182 --> 00:37:52,733
Two reckless people.

705
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:58,322
Yeah? Then what's the use?

706
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:01,525
We're just gonna keep
breaking things...

707
00:38:01,527 --> 00:38:05,812
Over and over.

708
00:38:05,814 --> 00:38:09,650
