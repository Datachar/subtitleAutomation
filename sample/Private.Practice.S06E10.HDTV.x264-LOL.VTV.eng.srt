00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:04,478
Damn it.

00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:12,300
_

4
00:01:12,386 --> 00:01:14,921
Even though I won't be back
in my office until I give birth,

5
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:16,455
I'm still running things here.

6
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:18,024
So y'all need to come up
with five ways

7
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:20,059
to improve
the patient experience.

8
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:22,261
'Cause I'm here to tell you,
it sucks.

9
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:23,762
That's it.

10
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,135
Did Addison say this is okay?

11
00:01:30,203 --> 00:01:33,005
She said I had to sray in this
position for 48 hours straight.

12
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:35,107
Well, this is not bed rest.

13
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:37,275
This is running a hospital
from a bed.

14
00:01:37,342 --> 00:01:39,010
Potato. Po-tah-to.

15
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:40,244
How's my girl?

16
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:43,580
This is an hour ago.

17
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:45,582
She's so tiny.

18
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,684
Small but mighty,
like her mama.

19
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:50,754
I think she's getting tired
of "baby King-Freedman"

20
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:52,290
on the side of her incubator.

21
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:54,090
- She tell you that?
- Mm-hmm.

22
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:55,792
I can't name her
until I meet her.

23
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,194
You'll meet her soon.
I promise.

24
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:00,797
I still like Mathilda.

25
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:02,299
You're joking, right?

26
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:05,168
I'm gonna put it on the board.

27
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:07,971
Don't worry, baby.

28
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,606
He'll call you Mathilda
over my cold dead body.

29
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,445
I wonder if there's asbestos
under there.

30
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,980
Not good for the babies

31
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:19,648
or any other patient
in this place.

32
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:21,783
Lord, I'd sell my soul
for arms long enough

33
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,452
to scratch those toes.

34
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,820
Boy, do I need a pedicure.

35
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:26,720
Charlotte, tell Sheldon
he has to see Nick.

36
00:02:26,788 --> 00:02:28,289
Nick the pedophile?

37
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,557
His name is Nick Calhoun.

38
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:31,359
Who cares what his name is?

39
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:33,027
You're talking about a man
who took a 7 year old

40
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:35,163
from my hospital and did
God knows what to her.

41
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,131
That is the Nick
you're referring to, right?

42
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,599
Why on earth
would you visit him?

43
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:41,001
He called me, depressed. He'd
been in solitary confinement.

44
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,971
Excuse me, Dr. King.
I need to place another IV.

45
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,305
Get on with it then.

46
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,773
I haven't decided what to do.

47
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:48,842
Sheldon, he reached out to you.
You have to see him.

48
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,710
Well, now that he's been
incarcerated,

49
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:52,779
I'm not exactly sure
if he's still my patient

50
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:54,348
or what my obligation is--

51
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:56,116
Your only obligation is to you.

52
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:57,450
Ow!

53
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:59,285
Have you done this before?

54
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:00,319
Stephanie.

55
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:02,321
Go. Now.

56
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,990
And don't come back.

57
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:06,225
Where the hell we'd find her?

58
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,461
She can't restart an IV.
My 9 year old could do that.

59
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,396
You know, when I went
to see Katie,

60
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,598
I thought it was about her,
but really, it helped me.

61
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:14,932
How would visiting
Nick the pedophile help Sheldon?

62
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,368
Can you stop calling him that?

63
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:17,702
The guy who took Sarah Nelson?

64
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,638
Uh, sorry.
Not my conversation.

65
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:22,640
Okay, look,
we are supposed to help.

66
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,409
I tried to help him
and I failed.

67
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:25,843
No, he failed.

68
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:28,446
Now he deserves to rot, alone.

69
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:30,847
All done.

70
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:33,050
Do you know...

71
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:34,518
how is Sarah?

72
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:36,253
Well, I recommended
a pediatric psychiatrist,

73
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:38,188
one who specializes
in sexual trauma.

74
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:41,025
Her parents are
cautiously optimistic.

75
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:42,426
I'm glad.

76
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:44,995
I'd like to castrate
Nick the pedophile,

77
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:47,230
but I'm glad.

78
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,101
I like her.

79
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,070
Charlotte, I'm your doctor.

80
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:55,804
You have to listen to me.

81
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:58,474
To stop the labor,
we need to keep you supine

82
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:01,643
with your legs 30 degrees
over your head.

83
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,178
It's called Trendelenburg.

84
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:05,147
Dr. Trendelenburg would've had

85
00:04:05,214 --> 00:04:07,115
a lot of fans
during the Spanish Inquisition.

86
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:08,716
Sadistic bastard.

87
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,626
- Yes, Dr. King?
- It's bad enough I'm living upside down.

88
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,462
Can't I get a decent pillow?

89
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:24,532
Tough day?

90
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:25,832
Oh, what tipped you off?

91
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,168
Well, two weeks in bed is
a long time.

92
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:28,369
That's nothing compared

93
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:29,803
to the six weeks
I still have coming.

94
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:31,305
How was school today, buddy?

95
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:32,773
It was fine.

96
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,041
Oh, can I go get a snack
before I start my homework?

97
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,809
Sure.

98
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,982
So much for today's
mother-son quality time.

99
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,784
He talking to you?

100
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,787
Uh, some. You know,
he's processing everything.

101
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,421
Ooh!

102
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,056
Lucas loves
having him stay with us.

103
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,591
I'm afraid he's gonna demand
an older brother

104
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:53,758
after you guys come home.

105
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,161
Mm.

106
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,264
I can't get Cooper
to leave the nicu at night.

107
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,333
He looks like death on toast.

108
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,469
You know,
not that I'm one to talk.

109
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,903
Well, you're in a period
of transition,

110
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:07,572
and the stress related--

111
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,073
Stop.
I don't need a shrink.

112
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,308
Right.

113
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,642
I need for my daughter
to get stronger.

114
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,478
I need to keep these buns
in the oven.

115
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:16,114
But I don't need a shrink.

116
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,816
Of course, being able to pee
in the toilet would be nice.

117
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:21,051
Yeah. Well,
I can't help you there,

118
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,155
but if you ever find yourself
on the verge of losing it,

119
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:26,590
distraction works well.

120
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:28,092
Some people count to ten,

121
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:30,094
and taking really deep breaths
can help.

122
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:32,963
I know it sounds lame,
but it works.

123
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:35,766
These... are good, too.

124
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:39,135
Stress balls.

125
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:43,372
Squeeze them instead of
biting somebody's head off.

126
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,675
It's almost as good
as talking to a shrink.

127
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:48,778
Can I get you anything else?

128
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:50,113
These are plenty.

129
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:54,516
Hang in there, mama.

130
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:17,071
How long does it take to find
a damn pillow?

131
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:20,072
_

132
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:22,743
She's got her daddy's hands.

133
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:24,011
Pulse ox has improved.

134
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,512
Her heart rate is stable.

135
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,080
I'm gonna teach you piano first

136
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:28,748
because then guitar's
gonna be a snap.

137
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:31,584
She's triggering the vent
all by herself.

138
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,553
Wait. What?
She's breathing on her own?

139
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,654
Yeah. I can take her
off the ventilator now.

140
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,389
Is it-- is it okay? Really?

141
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:38,324
- Yeah. She's ready.
- I mean, we don't have to rush it, right?

142
00:06:38,392 --> 00:06:40,359
Oh, I'm done.

143
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:41,927
Wow. Okay.
What's-- what's next?

144
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:43,361
Kangaroo care.

145
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:44,997
I-I get to hold her?

146
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:46,899
Yeah. Unbutton your shirt
and sit down.

147
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:48,400
Whoa. It sounds so different
when Charlotte says it.

148
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:49,668
Skin-to-skin contact

149
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:51,670
has been known
to improve oxygen saturation,

150
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:53,338
respiration,

151
00:06:53,406 --> 00:06:54,472
heart rate.

152
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,875
Here we go.

153
00:06:57,943 --> 00:06:58,943
I'm ready.

154
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:01,179
Okay, sweetie.

155
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,780
There.
Okay.

156
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,449
Hi, sweetie.

157
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:06,884
Okay.

158
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:08,019
I'm daddy.

159
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:09,253
You got her?

160
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:10,688
Yeah.

161
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:12,857
Oh, my goodness.

162
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:15,525
Oxygenation's improving.

163
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:18,428
Look at that.
It's like magic.

164
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:19,429
Oh, here.

165
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,099
Okay.

166
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:25,001
Say, "hello, mama."

167
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,169
Hello, mama.

168
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:29,372
The ball is thrown away...

169
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,906
We've got
better news for you tomorrow.

170
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:34,576
What'd she do?

171
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:37,046
What, steal your man?
Run over your dog?

172
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:40,182
Damn, girl.

173
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,885
You fight dirty.

174
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,787
No hair pulling?

175
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,287
- Huh.
- Is that your baby daddy?!

176
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:48,289
Huh.

177
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:51,259
So this is what it feels like
when your brain cells die.

178
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:53,194
- Oh, hell, no.
- Oh, no, you didn't!

179
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:01,068
Oh.

180
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:09,843
You only have to press it once.

181
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:11,043
What's going on out there?

182
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:14,313
Work, which I should
be getting back to.

183
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:16,382
Hey, do you like your job?

184
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:18,350
Is this a trick question?

185
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:20,386
- No.
- Then yes.

186
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,221
I mean, I know some people
think that nurses are

187
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,224
just frustrated doctors,
but I like being more hands-on.

188
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,893
Then it's your lucky day.

189
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,594
I'm making you
my private nurse.

190
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:31,263
No one else here knows their ass
from a hole in the ground.

191
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,064
I'm the Floor Manager,
Dr. King.

192
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:34,400
I can't cater
to just one patient.

193
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:35,434
You can now.

194
00:08:35,502 --> 00:08:37,303
Figure it out.

195
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:42,073
- Off the vent.
- Oh, my God.

196
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:43,308
- Hi.
- Hi.

197
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,509
Let's see.

198
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:46,177
I haven't seen you
around here much.

199
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:47,278
I-I've been busy.

200
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:48,746
Okay. I'll, uh...

201
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:50,948
- Okay. Take care. Yeah.
- Yeah.

202
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:59,190
Okay, uh, I'm gonna...

203
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:00,824
- Sam, thank you so much.
- Yep.

204
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:02,426
- You should go, too, Coop. Home.
- Mm.

205
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:04,561
She'll be okay without you
for one night.

206
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,731
I'll go get some clothes,
I guess.

207
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,373
Damn it.

208
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:19,908
Contraction.

209
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,278
I think it was, um,
just the one.

210
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:25,013
No, you've been having
contractions

211
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,915
- every three minutes.
- That was just pressure.

212
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,117
- I don't think it's actually a contraction.
- Okay.

213
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:31,053
Look, we've got you
on tocolytics

214
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,454
and we've put you
in Trendelenburg.

215
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,022
I mean, we could-- we could add
a magnesium drip.

216
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,291
It's not standard treatment
anymore, but it's worth a try.

217
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,727
It will provide
neural protection

218
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:40,328
and it might stop
the contractions.

219
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:43,465
Might? You said 48 hours.

220
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:44,866
That's all I had to go
without a contraction

221
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,468
to be able to lay flat.

222
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:48,602
That was my big prize--
not standing up,

223
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,104
not getting to use
the actual toilet,

224
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,306
not seeing my baby.

225
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,141
Laying flat...

226
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,778
I was living for that.

227
00:09:57,846 --> 00:10:00,313
I only needed 16 more hours.

228
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:06,386
I did not sign up for this.

229
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:44,766
_

230
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,555
Okay.

231
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:47,656
Looks like good news.

232
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:49,625
This is all just a bad dream,

233
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,694
and I'll be home for Christmas
with three healthy babies?

234
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:56,598
No, but you have stopped having
contractions for two days,

235
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:58,733
so you get to lie flat.

236
00:10:58,801 --> 00:10:59,968
Ohh, great.

237
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,637
How's that feel?

238
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:05,439
Ah. Still not the angle I want
to see Christmas from.

239
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:06,474
Mm.

240
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,309
It was gonna be great.

241
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,911
I was gonna sit my fat ass
on the couch

242
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:14,014
with three babies cooking
in my enormous belly...

243
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:15,883
while I drank virgin eggnog.

244
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,584
I'm sorry, Charlotte.

245
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:19,352
I am gonna keep you
on the magnesium drip

246
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,488
because it seems to be helping,
but if you have

247
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,257
any other contractions, I gotta
put you back on Trendelenburg.

248
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:30,196
You're lurking.
What do you want?

249
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:31,931
I'm here
on behalf of the board.

250
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:33,500
Uh, we thought maybe,

251
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,368
um, given your condition,
maybe--

252
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:37,003
Spit it out, Lisa.

253
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,205
How do you feel about
passing along

254
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:40,740
some of
your chief of staff duties,

255
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:43,342
just
for the foreseeable future?

256
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,177
I have compiled a list
of candidates here.

257
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:46,412
Have you?

258
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:49,248
Well, thanks,
but there's no need.

259
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:51,716
Uh, well, the board is just
thinking of your health.

260
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:53,685
Really?
That's what they were thinking

261
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:56,488
when they sent a mid-level
human resources manager

262
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:59,190
to relieve me of my duties?

263
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:03,027
You want to know what
the scariest thing in the world

264
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:05,063
is to an HR Department?
A pregnant woman.

265
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,664
Juries love pregnant women.

266
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:08,266
They especially love
when we have twins,

267
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,369
and oh, my,
do they adore triplets.

268
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:13,538
You see, right now,
it seems to me like

269
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:15,839
my employers are trying
to fire a pregnant woman,

270
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:18,842
and if that's the case,
I will sue you and them

271
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,177
and the whole hospital.

272
00:12:20,244 --> 00:12:22,046
And the only one
who will still be here

273
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:23,981
in the foreseeable future

274
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:28,018
is a very rich me.

275
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:45,934
You're sitting at the bar,
alone.

276
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:48,003
I sidle up next to you,

277
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:50,238
order a Martini.

278
00:12:50,306 --> 00:12:53,108
I'm in thigh-high black boots

279
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:57,012
and a silk slip
that's not quite

280
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,081
long enough to be decent.

281
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:00,215
Lips?

282
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:01,483
Cherry red.

283
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,917
Oh, I love this one.

284
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:04,018
Mm, you never heard this one.

285
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,787
We don't know each other.

286
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:07,755
We don't?

287
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:08,789
Nope.

288
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:11,158
I touch your hand,

289
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,293
ask you for a light.

290
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,529
But I drop my cigarette,
and when

291
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:17,131
I lean over to get it,

292
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:21,334
the slip rides up
just enough for you to see

293
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,737
that I am not wearing

294
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,538
- any--
- Oh, you're killing me.

295
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:28,708
What if my wife catches us?

296
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:31,077
Well, is she hot?
Maybe we can all--

297
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,513
- Oh, I gotta go.
- Wait. What?

298
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,313
Wait. Wait. Wait. No, I h--

299
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,415
I-- You can't leave me hanging
like this.

300
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,852
Female orgasms bring on
uterine contractions.

301
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,854
No.
You want two more preemies?

302
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,222
Oh, that's not true.
Please tell me that's not true.

303
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,125
Well, if I can't finish,
neither can you.

304
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,259
I love you.

305
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,128
I love you.

306
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,803
Drip.

307
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,638
Drip.

308
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,239
Drip.

309
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:04,341
Where the hell's that idiot
from engineering?

310
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,910
I put in a request to fix
the faucet yesterday

311
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:08,411
and the day before.

312
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,980
He's fired.

313
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:11,381
When I get out of here,
everyone's fired.

314
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:21,391
Oh, a pillow can muffle
a gunshot,

315
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,958
but not that damn drip?

316
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:28,030
8:07. Here she comes.

317
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:31,000
Look... at... her.

318
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:33,169
You just know
her name's Ashley.

319
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:35,705
Enjoy those perky boobs
while you can, missy.

320
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:37,372
Before you know it,
you'll need a push-up bra

321
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,973
to keep those girls
at attention.

322
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,408
Ow!

323
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:41,710
Oh.

324
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:42,777
No.

325
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,746
That's not a contraction.

326
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:47,082
Gas. That's all.

327
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:49,350
Just gas.

328
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:52,921
Who'd they bribe to escape this
hellhole with a healthy baby?

329
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:54,354
Ow!

330
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:57,091
Son of a bitch,
that felt like a contraction.

331
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:58,792
No. Don't go there.

332
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,260
It's probably just-- Ah! Oh.

333
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:02,929
Okay.

334
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:05,297
That's four. This is bad.

335
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:06,966
Very bad.

336
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:10,002
If this keeps up, Addison'll
put me back upside down,

337
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,038
and candy striper Ashley
will steal my husband,

338
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:13,940
and the happy family will take
Mason and my baby,

339
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:16,609
and the faucet
will just keep dripping.

340
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,878
Addison doesn't have to know.

341
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:31,823
That should do it.

342
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:42,533
Hey.

343
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,001
Come give me a hug.

344
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:47,338
Mm.

345
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,840
Mm.

346
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,509
What happened to your shirt?

347
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,345
I ripped it during recess.

348
00:15:57,515 --> 00:15:59,516
Is that a bite mark?

349
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,751
Who did this to you?

350
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:02,552
Just this kid at school.
Okay?

351
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,953
He's bigger than me,
beat me up.

352
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:05,988
Well, you all right?
Does it hurt?

353
00:16:06,055 --> 00:16:07,022
I'm fine.

354
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,493
What's his name?

355
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,161
Neal Segal.

356
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:16,365
Go ask Stephanie
to clean that up. Okay?

357
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,236
Think you can beat up
on my kid?

358
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:24,439
Think again, Neal Segal.

359
00:16:24,507 --> 00:16:26,508
Let's just find your parents.

360
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:35,717
What's wrong?

361
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,518
Get this tray away from me.

362
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:38,985
The only thing worse
than trying to get it down

363
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:40,587
is waiting for it
to come back up.

364
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:42,189
I can't wait to see

365
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:44,325
the Christmas buffet
you put out.

366
00:16:44,392 --> 00:16:45,892
Ugh. How do people
eat this stuff?

367
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,461
Yeah. Too bad one of us
doesn't have control

368
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:49,496
over the quality of food
in this place.

369
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:51,598
Hey. How you feeling?
Steph.

370
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,132
Hi.

371
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,767
Same as I was when you
asked me an hour ago.

372
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:57,136
This one giving you
a hard time?

373
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:58,938
Oh, it's nothing
I can't handle.

374
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:01,173
Yeah, well, at least you can
stick her with needles.

375
00:17:04,812 --> 00:17:09,080
Oh, needles.

376
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:11,817
Okay. Well, I'll let you
get your rest.

377
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:17,155
Tell me something--

378
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:18,690
you still into Sam?

379
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:20,759
That's none
of your damn business.

380
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,193
Well, the least you can do is
entertain me.

381
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:23,895
No, I may be
your beck-and-call girl,

382
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:25,062
but I'm not
your social director,

383
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,230
and I definitely
don't have to talk to you

384
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:27,431
about my personal life.

385
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,932
So you are still into Sam.

386
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,434
Oh.

387
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,972
Your IV bag emptied faster
than I expected.

388
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,407
Really?

389
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:39,042
Yeah. At the flow rate I set,
there should be plenty left.

390
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,877
You gonna give Sam
another chance?

391
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,185
Your brother wants to have
a party when you come home,

392
00:17:49,253 --> 00:17:51,755
with balloons and streamers

393
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,590
and a clown.

394
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:56,259
Although honestly,
clowns are a little creepy.

395
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,728
If you need a break, I'm here.

396
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:01,663
No, I'm good. Thanks.

397
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:04,600
Her pulse ox is
a little lower than normal.

398
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,469
On these little ones,
it can vary quite a bit.

399
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:10,338
Yeah. But her heart rate's
been creeping up.

400
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:13,040
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

401
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:16,076
Doctor parents are always
a little overanxious.

402
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:17,678
Mm.

403
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:21,482
She's got rhinorrhea

404
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,584
and intercostal muscle
retractions when she breathes.

405
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:25,119
I'll make a note in her chart.

406
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:27,688
No, she needs a chest X-ray,
and she needs arterial blood gas

407
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:29,956
- and nasal washings.
- I will let the attending know--

408
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:31,491
Okay, you're not listening
to me.

409
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,726
I'm not waiting
for the attending.

410
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:34,027
I'm a doctor, I'm her father,

411
00:18:34,094 --> 00:18:35,762
and I'm telling you
to go get tests.

412
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,864
You go get
the damn tests. Now.

413
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:15,341
...Alabama
versus Tennessee.

414
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:17,943
Whoo! First down, Bama.

415
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:20,480
Roll tide's gonna stampede
all over rocky top.

416
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:21,747
Alabama's the Crimson Tide,

417
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:22,848
but their mascot's an elephant.

418
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,117
Make any sense to you?

419
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:26,285
That's what volunteer fans
always latch on to

420
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:27,619
when they're getting
their butts kicked.

421
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:29,654
Maybe you guys should
just turn it over now.

422
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:31,256
Too much excitement might not
be good for the babies.

423
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:35,060
These babies are fine. They got
Southern blood in their veins.

424
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:38,130
The first one's
off the ventilator.

425
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:39,464
That's great news, Charlotte.

426
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:41,866
So you've been adjusting
your magnesium drip?

427
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:43,834
Yes, I have,

428
00:19:43,902 --> 00:19:45,436
and it stopped the contractions.

429
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:47,038
And you know how I knew
that would happen?

430
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:49,407
Because I'm a doctor
and the chief of staff.

431
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:51,675
No, now you are a patient,
Charlotte.

432
00:19:51,743 --> 00:19:53,477
You can't self-medicate,
Charlotte. It's dangerous.

433
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:55,012
It's Addison's fault.

434
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,748
She's the one who left an addict
with access to drugs.

435
00:19:57,815 --> 00:20:00,683
Magnesium is not a narcotic.
Nice try.

436
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,352
But since you clearly cannot be trusted...

437
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,088
I am locking the pump.

438
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:06,622
Tennessee's defense

439
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,658
is gonna have to tighten up
against the pass

440
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:12,128
or this could be a long game.

441
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:16,465
I already suspect the worst.
Is it the worst?

442
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:18,967
Chest X-rays show an infiltrate
on her lungs.

443
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:20,769
Yeah. The labs?

444
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,337
RSV pneumonia.

445
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:24,606
We're gonna have to put her
back on the ventilator.

446
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:26,908
I so wanted to be wrong.

447
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,977
All right,
I can't tell Charlotte.

448
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:30,546
She's already in hell.

449
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:31,479
There's no treatment
for this virus,

450
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:33,548
and w-with a baby so small...

451
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:34,815
- We're not-- - With a compromised
immune system. She could just--

452
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,250
we're not there yet.

453
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,818
All right, we'll put her
back on the ventilator.

454
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:39,820
We'll watch her.

455
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:42,323
We're not there yet.

456
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:50,197
Are you all right?

457
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:52,432
Why did you tattle to Addison?

458
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:55,335
That's-- that's why
you called me in?

459
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:57,036
'Cause I thought you actually
needed something.

460
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:59,072
I do. I need to know
why you ratted me out

461
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,440
about the magnesium drip.

462
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:02,809
'Cause it was
for your own good.

463
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,187
I'm thirsty.
I need some water.

464
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,334
What are you, 5?

465
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:32,237
It's not my job to jump
whenever you're bored.

466
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:34,205
- Get me another nurse.
- No.

467
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:36,540
- You're fired.
- No, I'm not.

468
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:38,908
You are definitely fired.

469
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:40,910
Oh, yeah?
You kick me to the curb,

470
00:21:40,978 --> 00:21:42,912
there'll be nobody else
to take care of you.

471
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,581
Every other nurse out there
would sooner quit

472
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:46,283
than walk in this room.
Okay?

473
00:21:46,351 --> 00:21:48,718
I get that you're uncomfortable,
I get that you're scared,

474
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:50,587
but you're not the first woman
to have a high-risk pregnancy,

475
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:52,288
so there is no need for you

476
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:54,323
to be such a monumental
pain in the ass

477
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:55,958
and make it impossible

478
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:57,760
for anybody
to feel compassion for you.

479
00:21:57,827 --> 00:22:01,197
Now I am trying my very best
not to smother you with a pillow

480
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:02,598
every time I walk in this room,

481
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,400
but you are seriously
trying my patience.

482
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:06,169
So please,

483
00:22:06,236 --> 00:22:08,970
for your health, for the health
of your unborn children,

484
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:11,306
do not even think about pressing
that call button again

485
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:13,908
unless you're in labor
or you're dying.

486
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:22,250
I completely agree.

487
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,219
Yes.

488
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:28,522
I assure you,
it's under control.

489
00:22:29,824 --> 00:22:30,957
What's wrong?

490
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:34,127
If you were paying attention
to our son,

491
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:36,429
you might've noticed
the bite mark on his arm.

492
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:37,597
Somebody bit him?

493
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:40,133
Is he okay? What happened?

494
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:41,935
He's fine. Apparently,
Mason was picking on

495
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:44,104
a kid in his class--
Neal Segal.

496
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:45,572
Oh, come on.
Mason's a good kid.

497
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:47,340
There's gotta be more
to the story than that.

498
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,141
The principal said Mason was
provoking Neal.

499
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,143
That's why he bit Mason.

500
00:22:51,212 --> 00:22:53,379
- Well, biting's not okay.
- Well, neither is bullying.

501
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:55,381
Taunting a kid is
just asking for trouble,

502
00:22:55,449 --> 00:22:56,816
and if it happens again,

503
00:22:56,883 --> 00:22:58,418
the principal's threatened
to suspend him.

504
00:22:58,485 --> 00:22:59,985
I will go down to the school.
I will talk to the principal.

505
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:02,421
No, you need to talk to Mason.

506
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:04,456
We need to cut him some slack.

507
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:06,525
He is scared and stressed about
what's going on here.

508
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,660
You need to quit making excuses.
We have to punish him.

509
00:23:08,728 --> 00:23:10,895
He needs stability.
He needs nurturing.

510
00:23:10,963 --> 00:23:14,966
What he needs is a clear sense
of right and wrong,

511
00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:17,469
and if his father's too much
of a wuss to teach it to him,

512
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:19,704
then I'll do it,
just like I do everything else.

513
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:21,572
Really?

514
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,641
Well, I'm sorry I've been
in the nicu 24 hours a day,

515
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:25,409
trying to keep
our daughter alive

516
00:23:25,477 --> 00:23:28,145
and watching Sam put her back
on a ventilator and--

517
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:29,813
Wait.

518
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:31,282
What the hell are
you talking about?

519
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,750
She...

520
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:35,652
She has RSV pneumonia.

521
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,520
Since when?

522
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:39,422
I noticed something
this morning.

523
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,424
I had them run the tests.

524
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:42,859
Why didn't you tell me?

525
00:23:42,926 --> 00:23:44,527
I've been trying
to protect you, Charlotte.

526
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:47,096
Like you're trying
to protect Mason?

527
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:48,498
You are such an idiot, Cooper.

528
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:50,532
You are not the only one
trying to keep

529
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,800
this family together,
Charlotte.

530
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:53,935
No, I am the only one
stuck in this bed...

531
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:56,171

00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:57,839

Bones. Brain.

549
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:46,394
They're all going soft
and mushy

550
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:48,496

00:25:11,652 --> 00:25:15,555
"You see, Wendy, when the first
baby laughed for the first time,

559
00:25:15,623 --> 00:25:17,991
its laugh broke
into a thousand pieces,

560
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,560
and they all went
skipping about,

561
00:25:20,628 --> 00:25:24,129
and that was the beginning
of fairies."

562
00:25:24,197 --> 00:25:26,498
You're gonna laugh for me
one day.

563
00:25:29,603 --> 00:25:32,237
You have to.

564
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,441
Surprise!

565
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:39,510
It's your nonshower shower!

566
00:25:39,578 --> 00:25:41,045
Why aren't you with my baby,
Addison?

567
00:25:41,113 --> 00:25:43,815
Because Cooper is. Hey,
I thought of a good baby name.

568
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:45,750
What do you think of Olive?

569
00:25:45,818 --> 00:25:47,418
I think
it's a Martini ingredient.

570
00:25:47,486 --> 00:25:48,886
Why didn't you bring
Mason by today?

571
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:50,655
He didn't want to come,
and Cooper said it was okay.

572
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,957
Well, screw, Cooper.
If I want to see my damn kid,

573
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:54,891
- that's my God-given right.
- You want a cupcake?

574
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,059
Do I look like
I want a cupcake?

575
00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:57,661
So that's a no then?

576
00:25:57,729 --> 00:25:58,996
Yes, it's a no.
I don't want your cupcakes

577
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:00,931
or your flowers
or your presents.

578
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:04,868
What part of "I don't want
a shower" was unclear, Amelia?

579
00:26:04,936 --> 00:26:06,402
We thought that
this would cheer you up.

580
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,638
You know
what would cheer me up?

581
00:26:07,705 --> 00:26:09,740
If you got your asses
out of my room.

582
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:10,806
Mmm. That's not gonna happen.

583
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:12,308
Hey, Charlotte,

584
00:26:12,376 --> 00:26:13,843
for patients who are on bed rest

585
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,379
in the same room
for an extended period of time,

586
00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:17,747
- it's natural they develop a kind of cabin
fever... - One, two, three, four, five, six,

587
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:19,215
seven, eight, nine, ten.

588
00:26:19,283 --> 00:26:21,651
And on top of that, you want
to see your baby girl...

589
00:26:21,718 --> 00:26:23,085
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

590
00:26:23,154 --> 00:26:24,754
It's hard for persons
used to being in control...

591
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:26,855
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

592
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:29,057
...take care of things
and them.

593
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,225
Smell that.

594
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:33,495
Which one's a trapezoid?

595
00:26:33,563 --> 00:26:34,796
It's a square at an angle?

596
00:26:34,864 --> 00:26:37,199
No. No. Wait. That's a rhombus.

597
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:38,667
All those years in school,

598
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:40,935
and the only thing I remember
is that cinema class.

599
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:43,571
By the way,
Elsa didn't love Rick.

600
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:45,739
Love story, my ass.

601
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:47,475
Every good romance
ends in death.

602
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:48,976
Without a plane crash,
consumption,

603
00:26:49,044 --> 00:26:50,578
or third-degree burns,

604
00:26:50,646 --> 00:26:52,079
two people can't just stand
the test of time.

605
00:26:52,147 --> 00:26:54,248
Mama.

606
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:56,817
Didn't you hear me?

607
00:26:56,885 --> 00:26:58,351
I heard you didn't want
to see me.

608
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,987
I didn't want to get yelled at.
Neal bit me.

609
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:02,389
Because you provoked him.

610
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,957
And when you push someone
too far, well--

611
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:06,626
Someday I'll show you
"The Burning Bed,"

612
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:08,295
and then you'll understand.

613
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:09,729
I never did it before.

614
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:11,264
That's not the same
as never doing it at all.

615
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:13,600
Everyone hates Neal.
He's weird.

616
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:14,866
Well, that's even worse.

617
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:17,703
You want to be a sheep?
Follow the herd?

618
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,205
Or do you want to be a man?

619
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:21,607
The kind of person
who sticks up for others?

620
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:24,510
Not only did you bully a kid,

621
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:28,247
which is horrible and cruel
and never okay,

622
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:31,082
but you lied to me.

623
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,050
- Did you apologize to Neal?
- No.

624
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,220
- Well, you have to.
- Why are you being so mean?

625
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,721
Why are you being so selfish?

626
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,323
I'm the one stuck in this bed.

627
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,124
Your dad's racing between me

628
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,693
and your baby sister
in the nicu.

629
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,662
And instead of being helpful,
you're just acting out.

630
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,263
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Are you finished?

631
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,732
Don't you get fresh with me.

632
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,103
We still have to discuss
your punishment.

633
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,106
Dad already did. No TV
or video games for a week.

634
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:57,941
Not a week. A month.

635
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:01,478
And you will apologize to Neal
and to his parents.

636
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:04,447
- That's not fair.
- Well, life isn't fair. Get used to it.

637
00:28:04,514 --> 00:28:06,482
I hate you! I hate you!

638
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:13,556
I hate me, too.

639
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,361
I got your page.
What's going on?

640
00:28:19,428 --> 00:28:20,895
Well, sats are dropping.

641
00:28:20,963 --> 00:28:22,130
BP and heart rate are unstable.

642
00:28:22,197 --> 00:28:24,266
What's her chest X-ray
look like?

643
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,533
Worse. Diffuse infiltrate.

644
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:27,135
I haven't told Cooper yet.

645
00:28:27,202 --> 00:28:28,737
I want to present him
with all the options.

646
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:31,373
If we oxygenate the blood
outside the body,

647
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,707
there's a chance that--

648
00:28:32,775 --> 00:28:34,508
No. Ecmo's too dangerous
and invasive.

649
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:36,143
Well, then what other option
do we have?

650
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,944
I don't know, but ecmo you can't
even do until 34 weeks.

651
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:39,246
She's still too young.

652
00:28:39,314 --> 00:28:40,681
Plus, there's no guarantee
of survival,

653
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:42,983
and then you run the risk

654
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,051
of bleeding, infection,
clotting, strokes.

655
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,820
Well, pneumonia presents
just as big a threat.

656
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:48,622
The ectopia cordis
and the prematurity--

657
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,423
I mean, she's--

658
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:51,557
she's already looking
at such a hard life.

659
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,359
I-I just...

660
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:54,427
I don't know if such
an aggressive approach

661
00:28:54,495 --> 00:28:55,728
is what's best for her.

662
00:28:55,796 --> 00:28:57,163
Well, it's not for her.

663
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,231
We'd be doing this
for Cooper and Charlotte.

664
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,667
Do what for us?

665
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,238
It's a long shot, but...

666
00:29:07,307 --> 00:29:10,742
they think that ecmo is
our best option.

667
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,577
How long would she be
on bypass?

668
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:15,113
A week.

669
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:16,448
And blood thinners.

670
00:29:16,516 --> 00:29:17,783
So Amelia would do
an ultrasound

671
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,419
every day to make sure
there's not a brain bleed.

672
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:22,353
And if the ecmo doesn't work?

673
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:25,756
Well, then our--
our daughter will die.

674
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:36,367
I thought we'd have this magical
first Christmas with Mason.

675
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:39,068
Mm, buy the biggest tree
on the lot,

676
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:41,705
drink hot chocolate,

677
00:29:41,772 --> 00:29:43,773
lie around in our PJs
on Christmas morning,

678
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:48,010
come up with names
for our girls.

679
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,846
Just be a family.

680
00:29:51,982 --> 00:29:53,350
But now?

681
00:29:55,618 --> 00:29:56,752
I know.

682
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,321
No, you don't.

683
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:05,460
You've held her

684
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:07,329
and you've kissed her head

685
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:10,332
and you've talked to her.

686
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,833
She knows her daddy.

687
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:15,603
But me?

688
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,807
Our daughter may die before
I ever get to meet her.

689
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,244
Pump is primed.
Venous catheter's in.

690
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,980
Okay.
I got some bleeding here.

691
00:30:58,047 --> 00:30:59,314
What bleeding? What's wrong?

692
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:02,149
Nothing's wrong, Coop.
We got this, okay?

693
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:08,022
Hello, precious girl.

694
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,958
This is your mama.

695
00:31:10,025 --> 00:31:12,660
Sorry you don't have
a name yet.

696
00:31:12,728 --> 00:31:15,029
I want so much to be with you
right now,

697
00:31:15,097 --> 00:31:17,397
hold your little hand,

698
00:31:17,465 --> 00:31:19,132
tell you everything's
gonna be okay.

699
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,201
And let you know

700
00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:22,769
you are blessed.

701
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:26,573
It may not seem like it,
but you are.

702
00:31:26,641 --> 00:31:29,810
I should be praying.

883

Thank you.

885
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:16,067
Yeah.

886
00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:18,469
These twinkle lights are
oddly soothing.

887
00:40:18,536 --> 00:40:19,870
Mm.

888
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:21,772
Maybe we should have a Christmas
tree up all year round.

889
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,141
All right, guys, hold up
your hot chocolate mugs.

890
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:27,111
I want sissy to see what her first
Christmas was like.

891
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:29,080
Yeah, we gotta name that baby

892
00:40:29,147 --> 00:40:31,114
before she's stuck
with "sissy" forever.

893
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:33,583
All right, but I'm not budging
on Marjorie.

894
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,618
I do not like it.

895
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:37,420
Well, let's go back
to the board.

896
00:40:37,488 --> 00:40:40,656
Okay, um...

897
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,326
- What?
- Mama?

898
00:40:43,394 --> 00:40:44,727
- What?
- My water just broke.

899
00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:46,595
- The babies are coming?
- Yeah.

900
00:40:46,662 --> 00:40:48,397
We gotta do something.
I'll get a nurse.

901
00:40:48,465 --> 00:40:50,165
- Mase!
- Wait. Let him go.

902
00:40:50,233 --> 00:40:53,035
I don't think they'll answer
the call button anymore.

903
00:40:53,103 --> 00:40:56,472
Oh, my God.
I can leave the room.

904
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:58,673
This is it. I'm free.

905
00:40:58,741 --> 00:41:00,309
I can sit up.

906
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:02,477
This is it, Cooper.

907
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:03,644
Oh, my God.

908
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:05,880
Kiss me.

909
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:07,781
All right, I'm gonna need
a surgical tray

910
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:09,517
to open the cerclage,
two isolettes,

911
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,652
and a nicu team on standby.

912
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,421
Wait. Stop.

913
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:14,822
Are you okay?
We're almost there.

914
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,258
I need to go to the nicu.
I need to see her.

915
00:41:17,326 --> 00:41:19,326
- You're in labor. - No. No. No.
You gotta go to delivery, recovery,

916
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,229
- and then the nicu.
- These two ain't coming this second.

917
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:26,199
Now I'm your damn boss.
Take me to my baby right now.

918
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:28,001
All right, Mase,
let's go get sissy ready.

919
00:41:39,712 --> 00:41:41,747
Oh, my God.

920
00:41:41,814 --> 00:41:44,083
She's beautiful.

921
00:41:49,656 --> 00:41:52,490
Georgia.

922
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:57,462
Your name is Georgia.

923
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:01,566
Well, what are you waiting for?

924
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:02,867
Let's get this show on the road.
