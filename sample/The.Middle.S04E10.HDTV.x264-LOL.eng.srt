00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:08,768
Through all history big brothers
have been torturing their little brothers.

3
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:11,494
But sometimes, little bothers
get the upper hand.

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,674
Give me back my guitar!

5
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:15,739
No. I wont it playing
air hockey fair and square.

6
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:17,481
What? (Scoffs)
But you don't even use it!

7
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:18,971
That's not true.

8
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,321
I use it to store
my post-its.

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,467
(Laughs) Wow.
You know?

10
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:25,325
I'm bigger and stronger than you,
so I could just take it back...

11
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:29,762
You take it back and I'll tell all your
friends that I beat you in air hockey.

12
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:37,414
I like this wire the best.

13
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:40,732
It's a string!

14
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:43,922
T-minus one day

15
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,910
until the "Planet Nowhere"
book releases.

16
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:47,097
Now that we're
in the home stretch,

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,105
I'll be switching
to hourly updates.

18
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:50,450
Brick, enough
with the reminders.

19
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,341
Your dad said
he was gonna take you.

20
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:53,947
You're not the most
reliable people.

21
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:55,474
Oh, and don't forget
my costume.

22
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:58,856
I just need a furry hat
and gloves that look like rocks.

23
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,186
And obviously, of course,
a pointy nose.

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,916
Wouldn't want
to look like an idiot.

25
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:07,090
Brick, I need to see you
in my room right away.

26
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:09,854
It's <i>muy importante.</i>

27
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:14,269
(Lowered voice)
Okay, as I'm sure you know,

28
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,382
it's mom and dad's
anniversary coming up.

29
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:17,872
It's their 20th!

30
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:19,672
(Singsongy) So what are
we gonna do for them?

31
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:21,260
We've lit up their lives
every day.

32
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,359
What more do they want?

33
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:23,860
I want to throw them
a big surprise party,

34
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:25,498
like you guys did for me.

35
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:27,614
You guys got me so good.
Remember?

36
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:28,727
Hmm.

37
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,654
Sue, I'm gonna be busy reading.

38
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:32,370
The seventh and final
"Planet Nowhere" book

39
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:33,495
comes out tomorrow.

40
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:35,168
I've been reading these books
for over half my life--

41
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,223
six years!

42
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,437
It's all been building up
to this final book.

43
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,607
You guys, it's their 20th.

44
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,109
Hey, I have an idea.
How 'bout we blow this one off

45
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,921
and really hit it hard
for their 40th?

46
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:48,001
Axl, there might not <i>be</i> a 40th.
They're getting older.

47
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:49,588
They might be dead by then.

48
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:50,309
(Gasps)

49
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:51,839
- Oh, my God.
- Sue, get a grip.

50
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:52,710
Okay, look--

51
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,349
let's just figure out
who's doing what.

52
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,093
Invitations?

53
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,364
I'll do those. Food?

54
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,152
I got it.
How about finding a venue?

55
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:04,007
That's more of a me job.
Tell you what--

56
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:06,983
how 'bout you guys
just work on the skit, okay?

57
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:08,352
- Can we go?
- Whatevs.

58
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:10,966
Okay. But let's all leave
the room at different times.

59
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,137
And everybody act normal.

60
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,699
(Whispers) Raise no suspicion!

61
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:18,036
So that's why
I think he'll concentrate

62
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,235
more on the Silligans,
who live in the outer rings,

63
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:22,344
but we haven't heard from them
since book four,

64
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:24,034
so who knows?

65
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:25,411
Certainly not me.

66
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,079
Okay, I'll start
at the beginning.

67
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:28,695
- Hmm.
- So there's this planet

68
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:30,839
that exists
outside of time and space,

69
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:32,890
its future rested
solely on the whims

70
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:35,107
of the mighty
dwarf warrior Gallantra.

71
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,824
Wow.
Your 20th anniversary.

72
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:39,415
That's a really big deal,
Frankie.

73
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:40,839
A really, really big deal.

74
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:42,160
Oh, I don't know.
People get so nuts.

75
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:44,107
It's just one year
later than the 19th.

76
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:46,150
Still, glad you made me
buy him a card.

77
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,233
(Laughs)

78
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:48,911
(Indistinct conversations)
Ooh, what's going on here?

79
00:02:49,057 --> 00:02:50,316
I bet it's a book signing.

80
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,563
This is where I got
Joy Behar's autograph.

81
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:55,443
Have you read "Joy Shtick"?
I'll lend you my copy.

82
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:57,931
No, they're releasing the last
"Planet Nowhere" book today.

83
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,061
Actually, Mike and Brick
should be in line somewhere.

84
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:01,863
Oh, I see 'em.
There they are.

85
00:03:01,978 --> 00:03:05,444
(Gasps) Aw.
Look how cute Mike is.

86
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:07,032
He really is cute, isn't he?

87
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,684
You know what?
I'm gonna call him

88
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:09,830
and tell him I see a cute guy

89
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,609
standing in line at the bookstore.
(Laughs)

90
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,524
(Dials cell phone)
You two are adorable.

91
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,129
(Laughs) (Cell phone rings)

92
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:17,489
(Ring)

93
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:18,982
(Beep)

94
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,626
They're taking Soran
and Ramale to the Outer Rings!

95
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:34,900
The Outer Rings! I knew it!
<i>(Tv playing indistinctly)</i>

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,791
Hello.

97
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:37,296
- Hey.
- Hey.

98
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:39,509
Did you happen to get
a phone call from me today?

99
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:41,269
Uh...

100
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,010
Oh, yeah. I guess I did.

101
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:44,780
Probably didn't hear it ring.

102
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:46,339
Oh, really?

103
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:47,545
(Tv turns off)

104
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,438
Well, I happened to be
walking by the bookstore,

105
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:51,045
and I saw you
look at your phone,

106
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,270
see it was me,

107
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,032
and then shove me back
into your pocket

108
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,468
with your change and your lint.

109
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:57,113
Nancy Donahue saw it, too.

110
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59,130
Yeah. It was
kind of embarrassing.

111
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:00,519
So you're mad

112
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,372
because Nancy Donahue
<i>saw</i> me not take your call?

113
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:06,363
No. I'm mad because
after 20 years,

114
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:08,454
my husband no longer
wants to speak to me.

115
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:10,446
You know, it's our 20th
anniversary, Mike.

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,789
That's a really big deal.
A really big deal!

117
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:14,048
Come on, Frankie.

118
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:16,572
You-- you never get tired
and don't feel like talking?

119
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:19,668
No. My husband calls,
I pick up the phone.

120
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,278
What if it had been
an emergency?

121
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:22,546
Was it an emergency?

122
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:24,916
No. For your information,

123
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:27,213
I was calling
to tell you you were cute.

124
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:29,421
See, that's the problem
with cell phones.

125
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,281
It's created a world
where people call you

126
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:35,211
just... with whatever thought
pops into their head.

127
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:38,160
What I do is, I actually
remember the interesting things

128
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:39,242
that happen during the day,

129
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:41,664
and then I share them
when I get home.

130
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:44,534
If you think about it,
that's... much more thoughtful.

131
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,719
Oh, I see. So you ignoring
my phone calls

132
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,689
is actually
you being thoughtful?

133
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:50,209
I'm just saying
there's two sides.

134
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:52,780
No, there's not.
There's one very mean side.

135
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:54,669
And you know what?
Now that I'm looking at you,

136
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:56,579
I'm glad you didn't answer.

137
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,554
'Cause you're not that cute...
at all.

138
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,630
You're actually kind of old.

139
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,663
(TV turns on)

140
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:06,426
Has anyone seen
my "Planet Nowhere" book?

141
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,522
I set it down on the air hockey
table for a second

142
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:09,939
because my eyes
were starting to cramp,

143
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:11,943
- and now it's gone.
- Wow.

144
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:14,102
- That is weird.
<i>- You.</i>

145
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:15,684
You stole my book!

146
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,656
Brick, there's only one reason
I'd steal your book,

147
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,229
and that would be
to draw boobs on it.

148
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:20,096
And if I did that,

149
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,648
I would obviously
show it to you.

150
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:23,290
This is all about
the guitar, isn't it?

151
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:25,708
You just couldn't stand
the fact that I had your guitar,

152
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:27,030
so now you took my book.

153
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:29,003
Mom, tell Axl
to give me back my book.

154
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:31,053
You can find your book
after dinner.

155
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,615
I was gonna read it <i>at</i> dinner.

156
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:35,516
Well, I guess now you're just
gonna have to interact.

157
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:37,532
(Mouth full) So, Mike,

158
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:40,278
I can't wait to hear about
all the interesting things

159
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:43,549
that happened today that you've
been saving up to share.

160
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:45,431
Everybody be quiet. Shh.

161
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,123
Your dad's gonna talk.

162
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:48,892
You have the floor.

163
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:53,247
As a matter of fact,
there was something interesting.

164
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:54,625
Today was Dave's birthday,

165
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,799
so a couple ladies in
bookkeeping threw him a party.

166
00:05:56,914 --> 00:05:57,924
Eep!

167
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,813
Yeah. He was
pretty surprised.

168
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:05,178
(High-pitched whine)

169
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:10,846
Oh, my God.
That was so close.

170
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,585
(Breathing deeply) Oh, God.
When dad said "surprised,"

171
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,401
I totally thought
they were onto us.

172
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,698
You know, I don't know
how you guys kept it together.

173
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:19,813
Where's my book, Axl?
I know you took it.

174
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,347
Hey!
Until I see some proof,

175
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:23,339
I will not even address
these malicious

176
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:25,153
and spurious charges!

177
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:26,359
"Law & Order." Watch it.

178
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:28,645
- Axl!
- Shh!

179
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:29,763
(Toilet flushes)

180
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:30,880
(Whispering)
Will you guys be quiet?

181
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:33,004
They're almost
onto us as it is!

182
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:34,737
(Jiggles handle)

183
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,832
(Gurgling) (Gasps) Oh, my God!

184
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:38,085
Oh! It's coming up!
It's coming up!

185
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:40,387
Stop! Where are you going?
I need your help!

186
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:42,701
<i>While Sue plunged deeper</i>
<i>into party planning,</i>

187
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:45,349
<i>Brick continued his</i>
<i>increasingly desperate search.</i>

188
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,421
(Axl chuckles)

189
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,483
Looking for this?
(Chair creaks)

190
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:50,370
I knew it.

191
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:52,375
I knew you took it.
Give it back right now.

192
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:53,866
Unh-unh-unh. Mm.

193
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:55,750
Since you've been raving
so much about this book,

194
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:57,430
I decided to read it
for myself.

195
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:00,171
Not the whole thing, of course.
Just the last chapter.

196
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:03,115
(Inhales sharply)
Wanna know how it ends?

197
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,160
<i>What?</i> No.

198
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:07,218
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

199
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:08,476
(Singsongy) Pretty juicy.

200
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:10,344
Please, Axl, please don't
tell me the ending.

201
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:13,363
I've spent six years of my life
waiting to see how it ends!

202
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:14,837
I don't know.
It's just so good.

203
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:15,974
I gotta tell somebody.

204
00:07:16,063 --> 00:07:18,035
You can have the guitar back.
It's all yours!

205
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,346
Eh, I don't want
the guitar anymore.

206
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:21,780
I'm kinda into reading now.

207
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,229
Please, Axl.
Come on. Just...

208
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:26,669
Just give me the book back.

209
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:29,692
Yeah, okay. (Chuckles)

210
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:31,858
(Exhales deeply)

211
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,597
Thank you.

212
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:35,155
Professor Faxon has been dead
the whole time.

213
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:37,076
- No!
- The Seventh Circle only exists

214
00:07:37,204 --> 00:07:38,464
in Professor Faxon's mind!

215
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:39,529
No!

216
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:41,701
Planet Nowhere is just Earth
four million years ago!

217
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:43,665
<i>No!</i>

218
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:45,797
(Thud) (Gasps and groans)

219
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:47,193
Oh!

220
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:49,008
(Sighs)

221
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:52,401
Brick?

222
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:56,943
I think I killed Brick!

223
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:06,571
(Exhales)
Oh, my God. Still?

224
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:08,507
It's been two days.
Now you're just milking it.

225
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,583
You're making me feel like
this is somehow my fault.

226
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,448
Fine. Be a baby.

227
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:13,846
I'm just saying,
you should eat something,

228
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:15,619
'cause it's not healthy.

229
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,974
<i>Our 20th anniversary</i>
<i>was just 2 days away.</i>

230
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:22,641
<i>Did I really</i>
<i>want to be fighting?</i>

231
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:24,887
<i>I figured</i>
<i>Mike had suffered enough.</i>

232
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:27,803
Mike, I'm sorry I--

233
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,479
Mike?

234
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,121
<i>(TV playing indistinctly)</i>

235
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:36,137
Hey. What is this?
What are you doing?

236
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:37,974
(Mouth full) Nothing.
Just having a steak.

237
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:40,099
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

238
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,893
Frankie, don't get
all worked up.

239
00:08:41,994 --> 00:08:43,825
I just-- I mean,
first the phone call,

240
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,247
and now this--
I don't believe this.

241
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:46,307
It's no big deal.

242
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:48,074
Oh, it is so a big deal.

243
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:51,254
So what? You just come here
and eat steak?

244
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:53,818
You just sit here
and eat without me?

245
00:08:53,974 --> 00:08:55,204
Yeah, sometimes.

246
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:57,134
Sometimes?

247
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,040
You've done this before?

248
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:00,537
It's quiet. I like it.

249
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:03,732
So you're saying you can't
enjoy yourself during the day?

250
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:05,186
No. Can you?

251
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:07,867
Well...
I just think it's rude.

252
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:10,505
You're having fun in the middle
of the night without me.

253
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,417
You're cheating on me with fun.

254
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:14,514
(Laughs) Frankie, come on.

255
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:16,456
You make a big deal
of the smallest things.

256
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,946
It's a freezer-burned steak.
Here, you want a bite?

257
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,513
No, I don't want a bite.

258
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:22,467
I want to be invited
by my husband

259
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,020
to have dinner with him.

260
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:26,029
You know, this is worse
than an affair.

261
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:28,603
(Chuckles) - What?
- Yeah. I could understand

262
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,717
if there were someone prettier
or younger than me.

263
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:33,522
But you're more interested
in nobody.

264
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,746
That hurts.

265
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:37,059
It's a steak.

266
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:38,799
I was hungry.
I made a steak.

267
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:42,155
You know, I was rolling over
to say "I'm sorry."

268
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:44,225
I was about to apologize.

269
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,296
You know, I think
it's really convenient

270
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,253
that you're always "about to"
do something really nice

271
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,423
<i>just</i> before I do something
you blame me for.

272
00:09:52,532 --> 00:09:54,155
Well, by the way,

273
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:56,431
I wasn't rolling over
to apologize.

274
00:09:56,535 --> 00:10:00,433
I was rolling over
to <i>apologize.</i>

275
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:05,394
Should have
picked up that phone.

276
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:06,443
(Bicycle bell dings)

277
00:10:06,558 --> 00:10:08,983
- Hey, Grandpa Big Mike.
- What are you doing here?

278
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:11,713
Did you get my message about
my parents' anniversary party?

279
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,350
Oh, I doubt it.

280
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,953
None of my answering machines
are working.

281
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,793
Oh, well, it's next Tuesday,
and there's gonna be

282
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:21,217
tons of speeches
and toasts and stuff,

283
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:23,797
and I was wondering if you might
have some stories about them

284
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,626
that you'd like to <i>share?</i>

285
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,419
No, thanks.

286
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,831
Really?

287
00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:31,565
What about the first time
you met my mom?

288
00:10:31,684 --> 00:10:33,105
Well... (Clicks teeth)

289
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,675
She seemed nice enough,

290
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:37,240
and I said, "are you really
going to marry this guy?"

291
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:38,652
And she said, "yeah."

292
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:41,303
And I said, "all right."

293
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:42,556
(Chuckles)

294
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,847
You looking for more?

295
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:51,180
<i>She was, but she wasn't</i>
<i>getting it from Big Mike.</i>

296
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:53,357
Why are we meeting
in mom and dad's room?

297
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,423
Because this is the last place

298
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:56,496
mom and dad would ever
expect us to be. Oh!

299
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,729
And by the way, we got nothin'.

300
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:00,308
Our party is a disaster.

301
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:02,067
The church
is no longer available.

302
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:04,339
Turns out they do Zumba Jesus
on Tuesday nights.

303
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:06,390
(Pencil scratches) Grandma
and grandpa are on vacation.

304
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:08,468
(Scratch) Grandpa Big
Mike was a big "no."

305
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,052
(Scratch) I told all of their
friends to save the date,

306
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:11,802
and none of them did!
(Scratch)

307
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:13,512
And have you and Brick
written the skit yet?

308
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,714
No. Of course not.

309
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,963
So basically...

310
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,008
we don't have <i>anything!</i>

311
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:22,525
You know what?
A lot of this is <i>your</i> fault.

312
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,049
I really could have
used Brick's help,

313
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:25,704
but you broke him!

314
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:28,398
Well... he took my guitar.
He brought this on himself.

315
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,482
- He had to feel my wrath.
- Well, you know what?

316
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:32,267
None of this is gonna stop me.

317
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,837
Because Sue Heck
does not give up.

318
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:37,078
Why not? If anyone
<i>should</i> give up, it's you.

319
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:39,141
We are just gonna
have to scale it down!

320
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:41,587
Simplify.
Work within our means.

321
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:43,208
But it is still
gonna be spectacular,

322
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,290
and it is still gonna be
super secret!

323
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,703
So... lock it up!

324
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:49,423
No mistakes!

325
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,659
(Hisses)

326
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,536
Hey, I was thinking maybe
we could go out to dinner

327
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:04,014
tomorrow night
for our anniversary.

328
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,415
I hear they re-did
the fountain at Fountains.

329
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:08,497
- New bubbler.
- Okay, but we should eat light,

330
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:10,357
'cause I know you have
a reservation for one

331
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,987
at 1:00 in the living room.

332
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:13,831
(Sighs) Look, I'm just
trying to get through this.

333
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:16,258
Aw.
After 20 years of marriage,

334
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:18,670
"look, I'm just trying
to get through this."

335
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,584
Thanks so much.
That's beautiful.

336
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:21,765
It's like a fairy tale.

337
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:23,818
(Scoffs) You are putting
<i>way</i> too much pressure

338
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:25,543
on the 20-year thing,
Frankie.

339
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,246
Remember, we both said
it's just a number--

340
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,824
one year after the 19th.
It's not that big a deal.

341
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,492
Clearly.

342
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:36,171
Ugh. Why do the kids always
leave their crap in here?

343
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:38,332
Mike, look at this.

344
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:41,050
They're throwing
a surprise party for us.

345
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:42,110
(Flips page)

346
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:43,135
(Gasps)

347
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:46,257
It's all our friends and family
together at our church.

348
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,038
I can't believe
they're doing this.

349
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,897
Music and speeches and a skit.

350
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:54,863
And it's all happening.
Everything's crossed off.

351
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:58,060
We have the best kids.
Don't we have the best kids?

352
00:12:58,185 --> 00:12:59,763
Yeah. Almost makes you
want to forgive

353
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:01,629
the husband
that gave 'em to ya.

354
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:04,079
Here, put this back
in Sue's room.

355
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:05,377
Okay.

356
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:17,997
<i>The next day was</i>
<i>our anniversary,</i>

357
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:19,564
<i>and I was flying high.</i>

358
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:22,879
<i>- Our kids weren't quite that excited.</i>
- You guys!

359
00:13:22,992 --> 00:13:24,955
You're supposed to be
helping me with the party!

360
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,319
You know what your jobs are,
so do them!

361
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,628
Sisters, huh?
(Chuckles) She's crazy.

362
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,628
Good thing we got each other.
Right, bro?

363
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,163
Come on, Brick.

364
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:36,812
What do you want me to say?

365
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:39,502
I can't rewind time.
I can't undo what I did.

366
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,641
I messed up. I'm sorry.

367
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,063
Just be my brother again,
all right?

368
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,176
I can't be alone
with these people.

369
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:52,606
I don't play sports.

370
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:55,100
I don't exactly have
a ton of friends.

371
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:57,733
I have books.

372
00:13:58,265 --> 00:14:00,745
You don't read.
You don't understand.

373
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:04,718
You don't know what it's like
to live in different worlds,

374
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:07,702
to travel on great adventures
through the galaxy

375
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:10,654
with people you know better
than you know your own family,

376
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:13,629
to live and die with them.

377
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,733
Have you ever loved anything?

378
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,476
Do you have any idea?

379
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:26,305
These are my friends, Axl--

380
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,569
my best friends in the world.

381
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,952
You took away something from me

382
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:33,084
that I can never get back.

383
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:34,674
You took it,

384
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,881
and you wrecked it.

385
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:39,758
(Books thud)

386
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,071
(Exhales)

387
00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:48,878
<i>So the night of the party</i>
<i>had arrived,</i>

388
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:51,523
<i>and Mike and I were fully</i>
<i>prepared to be surprised.</i>

389
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:52,573
Now what?

390
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:54,684
I don't know.
I guess we wait.

391
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:55,429
Hmm.

392
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,800
Do you think
they got a party bus?

393
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:58,822
Huh.

394
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:00,798
You know, even though I know
we're being surprised,

395
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:02,585
I'm kind of excited
for everyone to jump out

396
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:04,684
- and yell "surprise."
- Yeah.

397
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,550
<i>Hey.</i>

398
00:15:10,654 --> 00:15:12,362
What are you guys
doing tonight?

399
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:15,009
- Um, nothing. Just hangin'.
- Hangin'.

400
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:16,703
Oh, really?

401
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:19,711
'Cause I think you are having

402
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:22,614
a 20th anniversary party!

403
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:24,748
What?! No way!
(Laughs)

404
00:15:24,864 --> 00:15:26,374
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

405
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:28,397
- Did you hear that, Mike?
- Wow.

406
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:29,849
(Laughs) I'm really surprised.

407
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:31,921
Follow me.

408
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,433
No. This way.

We have a lovely evening

of skits, songs, and celebration
of your marriage,

412
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:54,874
followed by a delicious
spaghetti dinner.

413
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:58,556
Now sit down and enjoy
some nice appetizers.

414
00:15:58,672 --> 00:16:01,064
Are you sure
we have enough chairs?

416
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:06,513
Okay, Brick,

417
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:08,747
present the appetizers.

418
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,700
You didn't say
I was doing appetizers.

419
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,648
Would you excuse me
for just one moment?

420

(Sighs)

421
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:20,165
(Lowered voice) Yes, I did!
I said it <i>five</i> times!

422
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:22,038
Have you been listening
to <i>anything</i> I've said?

423

Just put together
something quick! I'll stall!

424
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:31,565
There seems to be a slight delay
with the appetizers.

425
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,007
So while you're waiting,

426
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,473
we're gonna do
the photo montage.

to do one fun thing!

496
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:09,016
You always try to do one
fun thing, but it's never fun.

497

Fine. Let's just
get through it.

498
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:12,823

- Is this the skit?

500
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,277
- He's doing you to a "T."
- Your spaghetti bowl is nothing

501
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:19,726
- but a big pile of nothing! Ow!
- I don't want it to be nothing!

for the inconvenience,

504
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:29,860
but it appears there's going
to be an additional delay.

505
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:33,563
Perhaps some cold cereal
while you wait?

506
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:36,835
Aw, Sue, stop.
It's okay. Stop.

507
00:19:36,954 --> 00:19:40,491
It's your 20th anniversary.
I just wanted to make it great.

508
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,424
Oh, it's just a number.

509
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:44,353
And you already made it
so much better

510
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:45,628
than we were going to.

511
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:47,428
I mean, we didn't even
get each other anything.

512
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:49,020
Speak for yourself.

513
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:51,411
What's this?

514
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:52,817
Open it.

00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:01,793
Oh, dad.

518
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,688
<i>Smooth.</i>

519
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:07,244
It's so beautiful!

520
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,578
Wait. I got you a card.

521
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,852
Damn it.
It's here somewhere.

522
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,374
- A-and I still might have to sign it, but...
- Frankie.

523
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:16,387
(Sighs)

524
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:20,420
Oh. I <i>really</i> love it.

525
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:23,924
<i>So it turns out the guy</i>
<i>who didn't take my calls</i>

526
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,675
<i>and eats steak</i>
<i>in the middle of the night</i>

527
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,948
<i>saved up all year</i>
<i>to buy me a ring.</i>

528
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:31,844
<i>Yep. Even the people</i>
<i>you know best in the world</i>

529
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:33,915
<i>can still surprise you.</i>

530
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,891
<i>Yep. Sometimes</i>
<i>they surprise you a lot.</i>

531
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:40,350
Here.

532
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,394
What's this?

533
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:42,672
It's a, uh...

534
00:20:42,786 --> 00:20:44,213
it's a new ending
to "Planet Nowhere"

535
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,351
that I came up with myself.
(Chuckles)

536
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,296
So, you know,
you can have, like,

537
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:53,096
the experience you
missed out on, or... something.

538
00:20:53,498 --> 00:20:56,078
Really?
You did this for me?

539
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:57,309
Mm.

540
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,008
Wow.

541
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,602
This sucks.

542
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:01,909
Ha.

543
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,204
Are you sure?

544
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:04,518
Maybe you just didn't get it.

545
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:06,299
You see, the entire planet

546
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,957
lives inside the stomach
of this ginormous dragon,

547
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,329
and then when the dragon
barfs it all up,

548
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:11,592
- it's just, like--
- I-I get it.

549
00:21:11,715 --> 00:21:14,945
Oh. (Mumbles) All right.

550
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:16,772
You know, actually...

551
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:20,029
there is a better way
you can make it up to me.

552
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:24,624
The problem is you've never
learned to appreciate books.

553
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,872
"Book one. Chapter one.

554
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:29,468
Gallantra, The Mighty Dwarf.

555
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,814
Beyond our galaxy,
beyond our time,

556
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:35,046
beyond our collective memory,

557
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:38,836
there exists a planet
of curious origin..."
