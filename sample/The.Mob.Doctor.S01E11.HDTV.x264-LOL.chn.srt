00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:36,033
大夫
Doctor.

150
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,868
这是她的病例
Her chart is up and loaded.

151
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,725
嘿，伊文斯小姐，我是德芙琳大夫

抱歉让你久等了
Sorry you had to wait so long.

154
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:50,548
我他妈都等了几个小时了
four damn hours.

155
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:52,233
等死我了
could have died.

156
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:56,053
那么，你的下腹部疼痛
So, you have pain in your lower abdomen.

157
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,054
对吗？
Is that right?

158
00:07:57,072 --> 00:07:58,222
对，好吧，我看一下
Yeah.Okay, may I?

159
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,726
好
Yeah. 

160
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:03,928
听着，我需要点止疼药
Look, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna need something for the pain.

161
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:07,949
我对布洛芬，酮类和吗啡过敏
I'm allergic to ibuprofen,ketorolac, and morphine.

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,283
嗯
Mm.

163
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:11,953
有一种D打头的药
There's this other drug,"d"-something.

164
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:13,287
盐酸氢吗啡酮？
Dilaudid?

165
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:15,006
对，对
Yeah.Yeah.

166
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,792
你的病征有点轻微扩散
You have mild,diffuse tenderness.

167
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:20,011
没有反弹，没有保护
No rebound, no guarding.

168
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,463
股动脉很正常
Strong femoral pulses.

169
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,298
是啊，这真是好消息
Yeah, this is really all good news.

170
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,268
你聋了吗？
Are -- are you deaf?

171
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:30,304
我刚才说很疼
I -- I said it hurts.

172
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:33,474
你知道你们医院的规定吗？
Are you familiar with your own hospital's policy?

173
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:35,443
你说什么？听着
Excuse me? Look. 

174
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:36,611
你得给我做个CT
You need to order me a C.T.,

175
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:38,479
还得给我拿点止疼药
And the you need to get me something for the pain.

176
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,764
行了，伊文斯小姐，你每年到医院来八十一次
Okay, Miss Evans,you've actually been here

177
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:43,151
每次都有新的病征
81 times this year,each time with a new complaint.

178
00:08:43,202 --> 00:08:44,369
再给你多做几次CT
Give you any more C.T.s,

179
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:46,320
你的卵巢就该有阴影了
Your ovaries are gonna start glowing in the dark.

180
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:48,956
我知道，但是这次情况不一样
Yeah, but this --it's different this time.

181
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:50,291
那么，我将遵守医院的规定
So, I am gonna follow hospital policy

182
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,827
把你转给一位药物依赖专家
And I'm gonna refer you to a drug-addiction specialist.

183
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,280
不行
I don't --I don't need that.

184
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:58,466
让专家帮你吧
please, get some help.

185
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:07,958
谢谢你
Thank you.

186
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:12,513
嘿，内特
Hey, Nate.

187
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:14,482
格蕾丝，你能出来吗？
Grace.Can you get away?

188
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:17,402
哦，我正在等化验结果
Um, I'm waiting on some test results. What's going on?

189
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:19,137
求你了，这事很严重，你必须过来一趟
Please, it's important.You got to get over here.

190
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:20,971
那好吧
Okay, fine.

191
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:22,807
哦，我时间不多
Uh, I just don't have much time, though.

192
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:25,142
我把地址发给你
I'm texting you the address.

193
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:35,286
咱们得快点
We got to hurry.

194
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,622
为什么叫我到这儿来好吗？我把事情搞砸了，
Tell me why I'm here, Nate.I screwed up, okay?

195
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:39,290
我知道上回说不让你帮忙了，可是这回我需要你
I-I know what I said before,but I need your help.

196
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:40,792
跟我来好吗？
Just follow me, okay?

197
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:42,993
要是有紧急情况，你就应该报警
If you have an emergency,you call 911.

198
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,879
除了你我谁也不能告诉
I can't call anybody except you!

199
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,880
为什么
Why not?

200
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:50,051
格蕾丝
Grace...

201
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:52,386
来见见马蒂小子
Meet Matty Boy.

202
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:54,539
马
A horse.

203
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:55,857
纯种赛马
Thoroughbred racehorse.

204
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:57,191
我又不是兽医
Do I look like a vet?

205
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:59,227
我要真找一兽医来他就报警了
No, a vet would call the cops.

206
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,212
你是谁？
Who are you?

207
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:03,364
格蕾丝，这是维克多
Grace, Victor.

208
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:05,700
为什么不能让警察知道？
Call the cops for what?

209
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:08,236
这不是我们的马
It's not our horse.

210
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:11,739
马蒂小子赢过阿灵顿比赛
Matty Boy won the Arlington Cup.

211
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,359
他的精子价值十万美元
His sperm is worth 100 grand.

212
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:17,829
精子？
His sperm?

213
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:33,377
他怎么勃起了？
Why does he have an erection?

214
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:35,930
我们想取点他的精液卖钱
We were trying to get his sperm.

215
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:37,882
但是他不肯合作
But he wasn't cooperating.

216
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,651
我们给他找的充气娃娃可能不合他的胃口
Our, uh --our dummy mare wasn't his type.

217
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:43,237
所以，维克多决定给他来点伟哥
So, Vic decides to give him a handful of Viagra,

218
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:44,689
结果它就再也软不下来了
And now it won't go down.

219
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:46,824
这马明天还有一场比赛
The horse has got to race tomorrow.

220
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:48,826
我得走了
Yeah, I got to go.

221
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:50,444
求你了，格蕾丝
Grace, please.

222
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:53,781
有患者需要我，内特，人类患者
I have patients who need me, Nate -- people patients.

223
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:56,734
这马是维克多的老板汤姆・沃斯的
The horse belongs to Vic's boss,Tommy Walls.

224
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:59,403
汤姆是海德公园帮的老大
Tommy's a captain with the Hyde Park crew.

225
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:01,071
是，我知道他是谁
Yeah,I know who he is.

226
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:02,623
他可不是你惹得起的人
And he's not the kind of guy that you mess with.

227
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:04,292
维克多负责马的运输工作
Vic's in charge of the horse's transport.

228
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:05,593
它原来是很容易拿到冠军的
It was gonna be an easy score.

229
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:08,596
求你了，帮帮我吧
Please! Help me out.

230
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,568
要是汤姆知道我们干了什么，我们俩就全完了
If Tommy finds out what we did,we're both dead.

231
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:19,390
卡罗尔，哦，布雷特
Carol. Oh, Brett.

232
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:21,108
嘿
Hey.

233
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:23,644
你弟弟怎么样了？还昏迷着呢
How's your brother? Still unconscious.

234
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:26,197
我们正在评估他的头部创伤
We're assessing the extent of his head trauma.

235
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:28,065
他撞车的时候我看见了
I was there, you know,when he crashed.

236
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:30,267
我们在法院参加一个听证会
We were meeting at the courthouse for a hearing,

237
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:31,819
他第一次当上合伙人
His first since making partner.

238
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,372
杰克当合伙人啦？
Jack's a partner?

239
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:35,606
是啊，都合伙人好几个礼拜了
Yeah, three weeks now.

240
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:37,775
是挺快的，我知道，但是你爸爸一定很会说服人
It's quick, I know, but your father can be persuasive.

241
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:39,443
是啊，这像是我爸的风格
Yeah, sounds like dad.

242
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:40,745
你给家里人打过电话吗？
Have you called your family?

243
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:42,713
医院给安娜贝尔打电话了，她正在路上
The hospital alerted Annabelle.She's on her way.

244
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:43,881
那你爸爸呢？
And what about your father?

245
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,383
我不知道
I -- I don't know.

246
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:47,802
我给他打个电话，好的
I'll call him. Okay.

247
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,724
小罗，谢天谢地
Ro, thank God.

248
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,894
我那了点酸苹果
I got Granny Smith

249
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:59,063
和医务科里所有能找到的间羟异丁肾上腺素
And all the terbutaline we had in the med room.

250
00:11:59,097 --> 00:12:01,566
我在药瓶上写了“过期销毁”
I marked the bottles "expired and destroyed."

251
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,984
谢谢你
thank you.

252
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:05,686
你知道我爱你对吗？
You know I love you,right?

253
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:07,488
是啊，我可以解释
Yeah, I can explain.

254
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:09,139
别解释
Please, don't.

255
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:10,992
好吧，谢谢
Okay, thanks.

256
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,498
你干吗呢？
What are you doing?

257
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:19,650
间羟异丁肾上腺素是治疗人类持续勃起症的
Terbutaline treats priapism in humans.

258
00:12:19,668 --> 00:12:22,286
马是哺乳动物，兴许管用
A horse is a mammal.So hopefully, it will work.

259
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:28,659
嘿，嘿
Hey, there. Hey.

260
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:34,599
现在怎么办？
Now what?

261
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:37,301
等着并且祈祷吧
You wait and you pray.

262
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:52,867
用李子干吗？
What's with the plums?

263
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,368
在监狱里
In prison,some of the guys

264
00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:56,821
有人用它造酒
Used to make a little hooch out of it.

265
00:12:56,855 --> 00:12:59,123
把李子绞碎，掺上点糖
Take a plum,mix it with some sugar.

266
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:02,293
结果有一天，造酒这人被抓住了
Anyway, one day,the guys got caught,

267
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:04,912
最后典狱长就把李子禁了一整年
And the warden banned plums for an entire year.

268
00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:06,580
我不知道你还是这方面的行家
I didn't know you were such a fan.

269
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:07,865
我可不是
I'm not.

270
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:10,918
但那时候我否认知道这个方法，那就是我想要的
But the moment I was denied, that's all I wanted.

271
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:14,088
嗯，有客人来了
Hmm.Here comes tweedledum.

272
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:15,589
泰塔斯
Titus.

273
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,308
你好吗，老兄
How you doing,buddy?

274
00:13:17,342 --> 00:13:20,144
嘿，你知道有个罗马皇帝跟你同名吗？
Hey, did you know there's a roman emperor with your name?

275
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:23,314
泰塔斯・奥古斯塔斯。哦，是吗？
Titus Augustus.Oh, yeah?

276
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:25,316
我问问你
Let me ask you something --

277
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,485
到目前为止你有多少机器交货了？
How many machines you delivered so far?

278
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,720
我没仔细数。我数了
I don't have an exact count. I do.

279
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:34,325
117台，应该是500台
117.It's supposed to be 500.

280
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:35,993
生产上有点延迟
There's a slight manufacturing delay.

281
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:38,663
我们要是缺货，竞争对手就会先于我们抢走生意
If we're short, our competition gets the jump on us.

282
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:40,164
那会让我们损失几百万
It'll cost us millions.

283
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:41,749
我心里有数
I'm handling it.

284
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:43,701
好的，我希望你不要胡来
Yeah, well, I hope you're not messing around.

285
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:45,736
我的意思是，大家都知道你和你的兄弟……
I mean, we all know that you and your brother --

286
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:47,237
觉得挣得太少了
You weren't happy with the price.

287
00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:48,906
那么，别胡来
Well,don't screw around.

288
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:51,241
是，我不知道，你这个偏执狂
Yeah. I don't know.You're paranoid.

289
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,745
思达沃斯，你给评评理
Stavos, talk some sense into your boss.

290
00:13:54,763 --> 00:13:56,130
听着，我们在同一条船上
Listen,we're in this together, right?

291
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:58,349
你如果需要我们的帮你
You need us to help you with that, uh,

292
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,668
改善生产效率什么的，就说话
Manufacturing delay,you say the word.

293
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:01,936
对啊，还有保安什么的
Yeah, security,anything you need.

294
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,105
我用不着帮助，我告诉你们俩
I don't need any help.I'm telling you guys.

295
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,941
在截止日前我会造出那些机器的
I'm gonna have the machines for you by the end of the week.

296
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:23,124
嘿，你弟弟怎么样了？
Hey.How's your brother?

297
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:25,242
杰克的脾脏破裂了
Jack's got a splenic fracture

298
00:14:25,276 --> 00:14:27,661
伴有脓液流出
With extravasation and free fluids.

299
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:30,164
他需要把脓液排出去
He needs an ex-lap.

300
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:32,166
他现在已经准备好去做手术了
He's being prepped for surgery right now.

301
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,137
怀特医生让我来做术前清理
Dr. White asked me to scrub in.

302
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:48,349
我妈的葬礼之后我就没见过我弟弟
I hadn't seen my brother since my mom's funeral.

303
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:53,154
你们俩吵架啦？
You guys had a falling out?

304
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:57,608
没有，因为我爸爸
No. It's my dad.

305
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,527
我们意见不合
We don't really see eye-to-eye.

306
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:03,697
哦，真遗憾
Oh, I'm sorry.

307
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,984
父亲会比较强硬
Fathers can be tough.

308
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:11,989
是啊，他查处了两个腐败官员
Yeah, but, you know, mine put away two corrupt governors,

309
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:13,374
这就让他变成了英雄，是吧？
So that kind of makes him a hero, right?

310
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:15,826
这让他的工作很顺利
It makes him good at his job.

311
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:18,495
我妈曾经说过
My mom used to say

312
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:22,850
每个伟人的背后都有一颗自负的心
That behind every great man is an even greater ego.

313
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:28,439
嘿，我得去做手术去了。
Hey, I'm gonna head to the surgery, okay?

314
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:31,776
你且不走呢吧？
You'll be around later?

315
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,877
对
Yeah.

316
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,729
好
Okay.

317
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,194
布雷特怎么样？
How's Brett holding up?

318
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:52,913
我觉得他还好吧
Fine. I think.

319
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:57,718
报一下脾损伤情况，大夫？
Grade the spleen injury,doctor?

320
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:59,386
非侵害性，
Non-invasive,subcapsular hematoma

321
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:01,922
囊下血肿占表面的50%
Involving over 50% surface area,

322
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:03,924
40%血供应阻断――第四阶段
40% devascularization --grade 4.

323
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:05,643
很准确，那么我们……
Exactly. So, we...

324
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:07,645
做一个德克松网状包裹脾脏修复术
Do a dexon mesh wrap splenorrhaphy --

325
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,146
挽救脾脏
Save the spleen.

326
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:10,731
好，第一步，动员
Good. First step --mobilization.

327
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:14,768
等会儿，心率加快了
Hold on.B.P.'s falling fast.

328
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,987
别是从脾伤出来的，已经不能再失血了
Can't be from the spleen injury.
There's not enough blood loss.

329
00:16:17,022 --> 00:16:19,940
先别给他灌注了，他的心率太快了
He's not perfusing.B.P.'s cratering.

330
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:22,443
可能是肺部栓塞了，加大氧分压
Could have thrown a pulmonary embolism. Increase the PO2.

331
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:25,246
加大生理盐水
Open the saline wide.

332
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,281
妈的！到五了，胺碘酮指数，150
Damn it. Run of five.Amiodarone, 150.

333
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:28,916
好吧，先别做修复了
All right,screw the repair.

334
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,285
我们得赶紧抓住肝脏
We got to grab the spleen and run.

335
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,609
眼底有反应了
Disconjugate,doll's-eyes movements.

336
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:48,896
他的腿受刺激后能动了，但胳膊还动不了
He's moving his legs in response to stimuli but not his arms.

337
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:52,400
这倒新鲜了，他入院的时候还是胳膊对都能动呢
That's new. He came in moving extremities times four.

338
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:54,619
那么，头部创伤导致了进行性麻痹
So, he's showing progressive paralysis following head trauma.

339
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:57,788
鉴别诊断是什么？
What's the differential diagnosis?

340
00:16:57,823 --> 00:17:00,708
脊髓化验呈阴性，也许是脊髓中心压迫综合征？
Spinal C.T. was negative.Maybe... Central Cord Syndrome?

341
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:02,627
颈脊髓损伤？做核磁共振检查
Sciwora? Need an MRI.

342
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:04,462
嗯，他现在还不够稳定
Eh, he's not stable enough.

343
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:07,164
机能损伤都有哪些？
What do we know about the mechanism of injury?

344
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,717
胸部和四肢擦伤，腕骨破裂
Chest and extremity abrasions.Wrist fracture.

345
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,535
好了，那就是说得做面部移植
All right,which suggests face-plant.

346
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:14,221
做宫颈末端弯曲和扩张的检查了吗？
Could there have been extreme
cervical flection or extension?

347
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:15,756
卡罗尔可能知道
Carol might know.

348
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:17,091
他是杰克的公司的资深合伙人
She's a senior partner at Jack's firm.

349
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:18,259
她看见他被撞了
She was there.She saw him go down.

350
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,011
我应该跟她谈谈。好吧，行
I could talk to her.All right, fine.

351
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:22,212
好，叫上格蕾丝
Okay.Take Grace.

352
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:31,238
威尔科克斯医生，你好吗？
Dr. Wilcox.How's your day?

353
00:17:31,273 --> 00:17:34,241
正在做胆囊HIDA扫描
Well, the gall bladder is getting a hida scan,

354
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:37,945
我正要去咖啡厅吃一个蓝莓松饼
And I am going to the cafeteria hoping for a blueberry muffin.

355
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:42,783
等会再去吧，我需要你参加一个会诊
That can wait. I need your help with a surgical consult.

356
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:47,421
那不是格蕾丝的病人吗？
Isn't she Grace's patient?

357
00:17:47,456 --> 00:17:50,207
格蕾丝让她出院，结果她在大厅里打电话报警了
Grace discharged her, but she called 911 from the lobby.

358
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:51,709
医护人员把她带回急诊室了
Paramedics brought her back to the E.R.

359
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:53,594
啊，我找德芙琳大夫问问
Uh-huh.I'll page Dr. Devlin.

360
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:55,296
她接了汉森的病例
She's on the Hanson case.

361
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:58,432
这太不公平了
this is so not fair.

362
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:02,186
可不是么，你回头再找格蕾丝问罪吧
Yeah.You can thank Grace later.

363
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:08,693
我需要CT扫描
I need a C.T. scan.

364
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:11,095
再给我点止疼药
And I'm gonna need something for the pain.

365
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:16,984
我对吗啡过敏
Uh...I'm allergic to morphine.

366
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:19,987
还有一种药
There's this, um...This other drug.

367
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:23,791
叫什么酮什么的。盐酸二氢吗啡酮？
I think it's "d"-something.Dilaudid?

368
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:25,493
对，就是它
Yeah.That's the one.

369
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:28,079
这比吗啡的药效强十倍
It's 10 times more powerful than morphine.

370
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:30,581
我的疼痛也是十倍递增的
Well, I got 10 times the pain.

371
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:36,337
我给你约一个腹部骨盆CT检查，再开两剂盐酸二吗啡酮
I'll order an abdominal/pelvis C.T. and two of dilaudid.

372
00:18:36,388 --> 00:18:39,140
你真是个好大夫
You're a wonderful doctor.

373
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:43,344
用不用我再给你拿个枕头或者毯子？
Would you like an extra pillow or blanket?

374
00:18:46,348 --> 00:18:47,848
爸
Dad.

375
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,735
布雷特
Brett.

376
00:18:52,571 --> 00:18:53,687
好久不见
It's been too long.

377
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:57,358
是啊，这是德芙琳大夫，杰克的外科医生
Yeah. Uh, this is Dr. Devlin,Jack's surgeon.

378
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:58,776
我只是外科医生之一
Well, one of them.

379
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,996
这是怀特医生，他是负责杰克这次手术的主治医生
Dr. White, chief of surgery,is handling his case personally.

380
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,498
马克・汉森，这是卡罗尔・古德曼
Mark Hanson.This is Carol Goodman.

381
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,917
这是杰克的妻子，安娜贝尔。杰克怎么样了？
Jack's wife, Annabelle.How's Jack?

382
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:08,953
目前他的血压还不太稳定
At the moment,his blood pressure is unstable.

383
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:11,422
我们现在还不能拿掉他的呼吸器
We're having some trouble weaning him off the ventilator.

384
00:19:11,456 --> 00:19:14,792
所以说，可能是大脑或者脊柱损伤
So, there is a possibility of some brain or spinal injury.

385
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:15,960
哦，不
Oh, no.

386
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:17,461
我的天呐，我还以为CT扫描正常呢
Oh, my God.I thought the C.T. was normal.

387
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:20,264
CT扫描不出神经损伤
Not all neurological injuries show up on C.T.,

388
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:23,184
所以我们还想问问关于车祸的情况
So we need to know a little more about the crash.

389
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:25,352
你看见他摔了是吧？没有，但我当时在现场
You saw it happen, right? No. I was there, but no.

390
00:19:25,387 --> 00:19:27,555
我听见撞车了，我跑过去叫了救护车
I heard it. I came running.I called the ambulance.

391
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:28,973
但是那是在法院门口撞的是吧？
But it happened outside the courthouse?

392
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:32,026
是啊，问这干吗？法院外边没有监控吗？
Yeah, why? Don't they have surveillance cameras?

393
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,312
有哇，我待会给法院打个电话问问
Yeah. Yeah, they do.I'll call the courthouse.

394
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:37,231
半小时之后就能拿到监控录像
We'll have those tapes in 30 minutes.

395
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:44,872
那，你找到想杀我的人了吗？
So...You find out who's trying to kill me yet?

396
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:47,875
哪那么容易就找着了啊
Well,it's not that simple.

397
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:50,461
我的手下已经把炸弹特征输入数据库了
Our guy put the bomb's markers through the database.

398
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:51,712
还没找到结果
No names poped up.

399
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:53,881
这种炸弹装置
The device is identical to a bomb that was used

400
00:19:53,915 --> 00:19:56,884
和几年前贝尔蒙（加州）的一起餐厅爆炸案所使用的炸弹是一样的
To blow up a diner on Belmont a couple of years back.

401
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:59,086
警察找到凶手了吗？
Yeah.Cops make anyone on that?

402
00:19:59,137 --> 00:20:01,806
没有
No.

403
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,174
贝尔蒙那家餐厅是叫皇家餐厅吗？
The place on Belmont --is it The Royal Diner?

404
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,810
对，就是
Yeah, that's what he said.

405
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:07,928
问这干吗？那是一起保险诈骗案
Why? It was an insurance scam.

406
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:10,598
餐厅老板想弄成种族报复案件
The owner wanted to make the bombing look racially motivated,

407
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:13,400
拿了保险赔偿之后分裂城里的帮派
Took the insurance payout,and split town.

408
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:16,070
朋友，你怎么会知道这么清楚？
And how do you know so much about this, my friend?

409
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:19,073
我调查过这个事
I may have consulted.

410
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:22,276
是吗？那是谁做的炸弹？
Yeah? Well,who built the bomb?

411
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:24,995
哦，这人你认识，吉米・倪德思
Oh, you know him.Jimmy Needles.

412
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,167
吉米・倪德思？就是他
Jimmy Needles? Jimmy Needles.

413
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:32,336
我跟你说，让吉尔把他找来
I'll tell you what --go have Gio pick him up.

414
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,171
我们得给我们的老朋友吉米・倪德思
It's time we had a little homecoming

415
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:36,123
开个欢迎会了
With our old friend Jimmy Needles.

416
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,008
啊
Ouch.

417
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:54,463
这只是头部轻微的撞击
It's just a glancing blow to the head.

418
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:55,747
是啊
Yeah.

419
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,936
对，看这，他的胳膊摔断了
 Yeah, see,he fractures his arm here,

420
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,055
然后他就地十八滚……
And then he just...Rolls.

421
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:05,891
没摔到头
No major head trauma.

422
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:07,893
没有颈部损伤
No extreme flection or extension of his neck.

423
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:09,644
你能放大点吗？
Can you zoom in?

424
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:14,199
好，等会，停
Okay, wait, stop.

425
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,650
在这儿停，快看
Stop right there.Look, look, look.

426
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:18,236
看他的手
Look at his hands.

427
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:19,454
他放开了车把
He just lets go of the handlebars.

428
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:22,824
他可能在撞车之前就失去意识了
He might have lost consciousness before the crash.

429
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,660
咱们之前的分析都错了
We've been going about this the wrong way.

430
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:28,580
没准是神经缺损导致的创伤
<i>Maybe a neurologic deficit caused the trauma,</i>

431
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:29,881
不是别的原因
Not the other way around.

432
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,551
那么，在意识水平改变导致的头部创伤诊断之外
So, what's the differential diagnosis for A.L.O.C.

433
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:33,885
还有别的可能性吗？
Besides head trauma?

434
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,173
要不就是，未知毒素的发作或者脑补感染
What about, like, a weird toxin exposure or brain infection?

435
00:21:38,224 --> 00:21:40,892
他以前有没有去野营或者出国旅行的经历？
Has he been camping or on any foreign trips?

436
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:43,345
噢，我们太专注于创伤治疗了，没问
Oh, we've been so focused on the trauma, we didn't ask.

437
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:46,431
他现在昏迷不醒，去
Well, he's comatose. Go.

438
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:48,600
问问他的家人
Talk to his family.

439
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:53,021
可能是大脑炎。或者是登革热？
Maybe encephalitis.How does dengue fever present?

440
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:56,191
我一点都不知道
I don't have a clue.

441
00:21:56,242 --> 00:21:59,694
我得接个电话
You know what? I got to take this.

442
00:21:59,746 --> 00:22:01,279
怎么了？
What?

443
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:04,199
格蕾丝，吃完你给的药马疯了！
Grace, the pills made Matty Boy worse! He's freaking out!

444
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,584
那马还在持续勃起呢？（priapistic―Priapism：阴茎持续勃起）
Is he still priapistic?

445
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:08,120
如果你的意思是：“他还挺着呢”，是的
If that means, "is he still sporting wood," then yes.

446
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:09,254
现在他很暴躁
Now he's all aggro.

447
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,124
听着，内特，我现在正忙着呢
Look, I am in the middle of something here, Nate.

448
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:13,175
格蕾丝，维克多说上礼拜
Grace,Vic told me last week

449
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:14,676
汤米・沃尔有个手下惹着他了
One of Tommy Walls' guys pissed him off.

450
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,429
汤米用火把把这哥们给烧死了
Tommy went after him with a blow torch, burned him to the bone.

451
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:18,930
你说他会怎么对付我呢？
What do you think he's gonna do to me?

452
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:21,633
好吧，我尽快赶过去
All right, look,I'll get there as soon as I can.

453
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:27,355
嘿，有个家伙在重症监护室把导管拔出来了
Hey. A guy in ICU just yanked out his E.T. tube.

454
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,857
好吧，我可以去调查杰克的病史
All right, I can get Jack's history on my own,

455
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:30,225
然后咱们再会研究
And then I'll just meet up with you later.

456
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:32,811
谢谢
Thanks.

457
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:35,063
没有，我们没去野营过
No, we haven't been camping.

458
00:22:35,114 --> 00:22:36,898
北京奥运会之后我们就没出过国了
And we haven't been out of the country since 2008.

459
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:39,785
几个星期前，我们一起参加了一个法律会议
A couple of weeks ago, we went to a legal conference together.

460
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:40,869
在哪开的？
Anywhere exotic?

461
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:43,905
托莱多，机场酒店
Toledo --the airport hotel.

462
00:22:43,956 --> 00:22:46,041
杰克有没有可能在飞机上被传染了什么病？
Could Jack have caught something on the plane?

463
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:48,794
不好说，我们得做一个全面的传染病检查
Maybe. We're doing a full infectious workup.

464
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:52,047
他不会有事的，对么？
He's gonna be okay.Right?

465
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:55,167
孩子，别对我们隐瞒他的病情
Just tell us the truth,son.

466
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:59,004
不会的，爸爸
I always do, dad.

467
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,725
杰克他……不太稳定
Jack is...Becoming less stable.

468
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,361
要是我们查不出病因，他就……
If we don't find out the cause, then...

469
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:07,395
他就会死？
He could die?

470
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:11,283
哦，天呐
Oh, God.

471
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:16,822
安娜贝尔，我们会尽最大努力的
A-Annabelle, we're doing everything we can.

472
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:21,409
我得去给杰克做检查了
I-I'm gonna go check on Jack.

473
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:29,417
别害怕，哥们，别害怕
Easy, buddy.Easy, easy.

474
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:30,752
不，不，不，没事，没事
No, no, no.It's okay. It's okay.

475
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:33,371
不，我……我正在换轮胎
No, I'm, uh...No,I'm changing the tire right now.

476
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:34,873
我们会把马蒂小子及时送到测试场的
I'm gonna get Matty Boy to the track on time.

477
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:36,708
不用担心
Don't sweat it.

478
00:23:36,742 --> 00:23:39,461
我给咱们争取了个把小时的时间
all right, I bought us one hour, maybe two tops.

479
00:23:39,512 --> 00:23:41,463
要是还搞不定，汤米就知道这件事了
After that,Tommy's gonna know what's up.

480
00:23:41,514 --> 00:23:42,464
谢天谢地
Thank God.

481
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:43,798
嘿，赶紧给他看看吧
Hey, take your time, why don't you?

482
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:47,102
这马怎么了？
What's wrong with him?

483
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:52,691
他上次撒尿是什么时候？
When was the last time he urinated?

484
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:57,979
他没尿
He hasn't.

485
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:01,116
他需要阴茎注射苯肾上腺素（一种血管收缩剂）
He needs an intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine.

486
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,117
什么玩意儿？
A what now?

487
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:03,785
我得先给他打一针克他命（一种强效麻醉剂）让他平静下来
I got to tranquilize him with ketamine

488
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,904
让他把阴茎里的血排出来。喔！喔！
And drain the blood from his penis. Whoa, whoa.

489
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:07,906
这匹马明天还有比赛呢
This horse has to race tomorrow,

490
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,542
测试场会把所有的药物都检查出来的
And the track is gonna test for performance enhancers, all of that.

491
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:12,794
克他命是一种镇静剂，不是兴奋剂，所以，应该没事
Well, ketamine's a downer, not an upper, so we should be fine.

492
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:15,330
那笨什么素是干吗用的？苯肾上腺素
What about the phenyl...Ephen? Phenylephrine.

493
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:16,414
尿检会查出来吗？
Is it gonna show up in a urine test?

494
00:24:16,448 --> 00:24:17,883
我也不知道，他们都查什么，内特
I don't know what they test for, Nate.

495
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:19,384
那我们就没法让他比赛了
Then we can't risk it.

496
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:21,219
格蕾丝
Grace.

497
00:24:23,873 --> 00:24:29,844
在马骑到充气娃娃上之后
After the horse mounted the, uh...Dummy mare,

498
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:33,064
你们到底是怎么取精液的？
How were you actually gonna collect the sperm?

499
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:39,070
那东西叫人造阴道
Well, it's called an artificial vagina.

500
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:48,313
让我瞧瞧
Let me see it.

501
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,868
这就是充了水的橡胶管
It's just rubber tubing filled with water,

502
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,704
但是我们没用上
But we didn't get to use it.

503
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,958
好吧，给我拿个冰袋来。干吗使啊？
Okay, get me a bag of ice. Why?

504
00:24:59,992 --> 00:25:02,177
我要用物理方法让这匹马“降温”
Because I need a noninvasive way to help the horse.

505
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,211
你要有别的问题吗？
Do you have any other questions?

506
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:11,553
你呼的我？
You paged me?

507
00:25:11,604 --> 00:25:12,938
腹部CT结果出来了
Abdominal C.T.

508
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:16,107
看看肠系膜上动脉的栓塞
Check out the clot in the superior mesenteric artery.

509
00:25:16,142 --> 00:25:18,676
严重血栓症，这是谁的CT结果？
Acute thrombosis.Who's C.T. is this?

510
00:25:18,694 --> 00:25:20,061
我们的常客
Our frequent flyer.

511
00:25:20,112 --> 00:25:21,346
真的假的？
You're kidding?

512
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,616
这回她是真病了
She actually has something wrong this time.

513
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,452
她的肠部坏死，不动手术她会死的
Her bowel's necrosing.Without surgery, she'll die.

514
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:29,020
德芙琳大夫误诊了
Dr. Devlin missed it.

515
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,523
还让我承担这个结果，就是这么回事
And I caught it.That's all that matters.

516
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:35,460
吉米！哈？
Jimmy! Huh?

517
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,195
吉米・倪德思
Jimmy Needles.

518
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:38,330
别来无恙啊
Long time, no see.

519
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,967
你看上去不是特别好哇，吉米
You're not looking too good there, Jimmy.

520
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:46,204
我发誓，我不知道他们把炸弹寄给你了
I swear...I -- I didn't know that they'd send you that bomb.

521
00:25:46,222 --> 00:25:48,206
你说什么？
What was that you said?

522
00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:51,726
他们？他们是谁啊？吉米？
"they"? Who's "they," Jimmy?

523
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:55,597
我从来不跟客户见面
I never meet my customers.

524
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:05,440
我有个预约系统
I got a booking system.

525
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:09,744
我的客户会得到一个三位的密码，然后他们把现金给我
My customers get a three-digit code, and they leave me cash.

526
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,946
他说他把一个包放在简诺拉公园的长椅下边
Says he dropped a package under a bench in Janura Park.

527
00:26:11,998 --> 00:26:13,948
我说的都是真的
I'm telling the truth.

528
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,733
好吧，我相信你
All right,I believe you.

529
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:20,171
这么说，你这个客户的号码是什么？
So, what number is your buyer?

530
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:22,674
4-4-7.

531
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,343
但是我不知道这个客户是谁，我也不想知道
But I don't know who that is.I don't want to know.

532
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:27,412
这就是我们交易的方法
That's the way it works.

533
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,914
这么说倒是很合理，知道吗，吉米？
I mean, you know, that makes sense to me, Jimmy, you know?

534
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:32,417
用谨慎的交易方式寻找你的客户
Discreet business practice,looking out for your customers.

535
00:26:33,436 --> 00:26:35,970
啊！你给我听好
Aah! You listen to me.

536
00:26:36,022 --> 00:26:37,639
你得把我想知道的都告诉我
You're gonna tell me what I want to know,

537
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,141
否则我就打碎你的脑袋就像打碎一个椰子
Or I'm gonna crack your head open like a coconut

538
00:26:40,192 --> 00:26:42,143
然后拿你喂狗
And feed you to my dogs!

539
00:26:42,194 --> 00:26:45,647
安马拓兄弟
The Amato brothers.

540
00:26:46,699 --> 00:26:48,616
你想骗我？
are you lying to me?

541
00:26:48,651 --> 00:26:51,453
4-4-7……那就是安马拓兄弟的代号
4-4-7...That's the Amato brothers.

542
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:52,704
他们雇的我
They hired me.

543
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,456
我发誓
I swear.

544
00:26:57,827 --> 00:27:00,945
巴闭，给他松绑
Bobby, cut him loose.

545
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:05,667
把他扔到小巷的垃圾堆里去
Throw him out in the alley with the rest of the garbage.

546
00:27:05,718 --> 00:27:08,636
你救了丹蒂的名，他就这么报答你？
You saved Dante's life,and this is how they repay you?

547
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:10,955
嘿，安马拓就是这么贪婪
Hey, the Amatos were always greedy pigs.

548
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:14,142
他们认为跟着就能得到整个地盘
They figured with me gone,they can get the whole pie.

549
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,010
要不我召集一个会议？
Want me to set up a meeting?

550
00:27:16,062 --> 00:27:19,397
不，不能再谈了
No. No more talk.

551
00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:27,105
格蕾丝，冰都快化了
Grace, the ice is starting to melt.

552
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:29,524
很好，那你就再把它填满
Good, then you can refill it.

553
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:31,142
他是在装死吗？
What,is he playing dead?

554
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,477
他睡着了
He's sedated.

555
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:35,480
维克，我的手都快冻僵了
Vic, my hand is starting to freeze.

556
00:27:35,498 --> 00:27:36,664
你接着弄吧
Take over.

557
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,343
嘿，大夫，我觉得这方法起作用了
Hey, Doc,I think it's working.

558
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:51,296
妈的，我姐棒不棒？
Damn, is my sister good or what?

559
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:54,933
嘿，维克，抓紧了
Hey, Vic.Hang on tight.

560
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:56,434
嘿，嘿！
Hey, hey!

561
00:27:56,469 --> 00:27:58,019
这张不错
good one, man.

562
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,171
喔，喔，喔
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

563
00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:01,389
你觉着有意思吗？
You think that's funny?

564
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,192
小子，你知道我为谁工作吗？
Dude,you know who I work for?

565
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:09,013
我觉得还是算了，维克多
I -- I think you should walk away, Victor.

566
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,067
维克多，走开
Victor, walk away.

567
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,155
有这么个姐姐算你走运，手淫去吧
You're lucky she's your sister, jackoff.

568
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,547
听我说，我知道我搞砸了
Look...I know I screwed up, okay?

569
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:53,550
但是咱们能跳过沉默阶段
But can we just, like,skip the silent treatment

570
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:55,501
直接骂我一顿得了
And get to the part where you yell at me?

571
00:28:58,055 --> 00:28:59,689
你知道吗？
You know what?

572
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:02,859
现在，布雷特的弟弟正在重症监护室
Right now,Brett's brother is in the ICU.

573
00:29:02,893 --> 00:29:06,529
而我却又被拉到这儿来处理你这些破事儿
And instead of being there,I am dealing with your crap again.

574
00:29:06,564 --> 00:29:07,864
你能不能成熟点啊
You have got to grow up.

575
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:09,616
我也不是没干正经事啊
I'm part of something right now.

576
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,784
这事要是能行的话
I-if this had worked --

577
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:12,786
要是这事能行？
"if this had worked"?

578
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,355
内特，你不会这么蠢吧
Come on, Nate.You know better.

579
00:29:20,962 --> 00:29:23,463
谢谢
Thanks.

580
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,860
你完全可以跟我说不给我药，对吧？
You could have just said no to the meds, all right?

581
00:29:35,878 --> 00:29:37,162
还有很多别的医院可以去
There are plenty of other hospitals.

582
00:29:37,196 --> 00:29:39,581
你得了肠系膜血管血栓
You have a mesenteric thrombosis.

583
00:29:39,632 --> 00:29:40,966
就跟我知道那是什么意思似的
Like I'm supposed to know what that means.

584
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,885
意思是，如果你不做手术就会死
It means that without surgery,you will die.

585
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,758
你真不会撒谎，大夫
You're a bad liar, Doc.

586
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:52,511
好吧
Fine.

587
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:54,513
反正要死的人是你
It's your funeral.

588
00:29:54,547 --> 00:29:57,516
那你就签个“不遵医嘱”的表格吧
Just read and sign this "against medical advice" form

589
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,351
我好留个证据
While I get a witness.

590
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:01,903
留证据干吗？
You need a witness for what?

591
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:03,238
我解释过不配合治疗的
That I explained the consequences

592
00:30:03,272 --> 00:30:05,407
的严重后果了
Of denying the recommended treatment.

593
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:07,742
一会见吧
See you later.

594
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:10,078
等等
Wait.

595
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:18,753
如果我同意手术，能给我一些吗啡酮吗？
If I agree to the surgery,can I have some more dilaudid?

596
00:30:26,412 --> 00:30:28,880
对刺激测试毫无反应
No response to painful stimuli at all.

597
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:30,098
毫无进展
It's progressing.

598
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:33,018
没准做个脊椎抽液能发现点新情况
Well, maybe something will show during the spinal tap.

599
00:30:36,973 --> 00:30:38,473
看见了吗？
Have you seen this?

600
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:45,146
那是皮肉擦伤吗？他当时穿了衣服的啊
Is that road rash? He was wearing a suit.

601
00:30:45,198 --> 00:30:47,532
触感很软，你觉得会不会是皮下脓肿？
Boggy to the touch. You think there's an abscess underneath?

602
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:50,735
你把紫外线灯递给我
Will you hand me that wood's lamp over there?

603
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,454
是真菌感染？
Thinking fungal infection?

604
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:54,372
如果是的话会在紫外线灯下能显示出来
If it is, it'll show up under the black light.

605
00:30:57,577 --> 00:30:59,944
不是真菌
It's not fungus.

606
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:04,799
是“卡罗尔”
It's "Carol."

607
00:31:09,055 --> 00:31:11,673
布雷特？卡罗尔
Brett? Carol.

608
00:31:11,724 --> 00:31:14,509
我看见你呼我了
Um...I had you paged.

609
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,428
我们得谈谈
We need to...talk.

610
00:31:16,462 --> 00:31:18,313
怎么了？
What's going on?

611
00:31:18,347 --> 00:31:20,849
你知道杰克的纹身吗？
Do you know anything about Jack's tattoo?

612
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,318
哦，天呐
Oh, God.

613
00:31:23,352 --> 00:31:26,404
你是不是跟我弟弟有过那么一段？
Are -- are you having an affair with my brother?

614
00:31:29,642 --> 00:31:32,527
卡罗尔，你从他很小的时候就认识他
Carol, you've...known him since he was a kid,

615
00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:34,529
而且你还是他的老板
And you're his boss.

616
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,082
我们也不知道会那样
We didn't mean for it to happen.

617
00:31:37,116 --> 00:31:39,117
听着，那个纹身被感染了
Look, the --the tattoo's infected.

618
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:41,002
我想知道他是在哪纹的
I need to know where he got it.

619
00:31:41,037 --> 00:31:43,171
巴巴多斯岛（西印度群岛中的岛屿，度假胜地）
Barbados.

620
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:46,041
那是一家布里奇顿（巴巴多斯岛首都）的纹身店
It's a tattoo parlor in Bridgetown

621
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:47,876
他们专门纹只有通过紫外线能看到的纹身
Where they specialize in U.V. tattoos.

622
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:49,928
他什么时候纹的？
When did he get it?

623
00:31:49,962 --> 00:31:51,179
九天之前
Nine days ago.

624
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:54,165
这么说，你们根本没再托莱多开会对么？
So, you weren't at a conference in Toledo?

625
00:31:54,183 --> 00:31:56,601
没有
No.

626
00:31:56,636 --> 00:32:01,706
布莱特，自从你妈妈去世之后
Brett...After your mother passed,

627
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:04,943
杰克连个说心里话的人都没有
Jack had no one else that he could talk to.

628
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:06,344
他妻子不是吗？
How about his wife?

629
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:08,680
他根本就没想跟安娜贝尔结婚
He never wanted to marry Annabelle.

630
00:32:08,698 --> 00:32:10,849
那是你爸爸的决定
That was your father's pick.

631
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:13,518
你知道么，杰克做的每一件事
All right, you know that everything that Jack does,

632
00:32:13,536 --> 00:32:15,737
都是你爸爸在幕后操纵的
Your father pulls the strings.

633
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:17,372
为什么你觉得他这么卑鄙？
Why do you think he's so miserable?

634
00:32:17,406 --> 00:32:19,741
我不知道他是这样的
I didn't know he was.

635
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:23,712
自从你离开，你爸爸就把原本想让你干的事
Since you left, everything your father wanted for you --

636
00:32:23,746 --> 00:32:26,214
全都压在杰克身上
Now it's on Jack.

637
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:32,387
现在你怎么想我都没关系，但是，求你
Now, you can think what you want about me, but, please...

638
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:34,539
别让他死
...Don't let him die.

639
00:32:42,648 --> 00:32:44,933
骨头！
Bones!

640
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:47,936
嘿，骨头，过来，小子！
yo, Bones! Come here, boy!

641
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:56,111
骨头！
Bones!

642
00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:58,246
嘿，别又把鞋叼走了
Hey, that better not be another shoe.

643
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,335
卧槽得嘞！
What the hell? Ugh!

644
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:07,672
为什么？你脑子有病！
<i>Why, you lame brain!</i>

645
00:33:07,707 --> 00:33:09,007
来一杯威士忌？
You want a whiskey?

646
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:11,760
我得回家了
I got to drive home.

647
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:13,595
你在这失败了
So, you crash here.

648
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:14,846
为什么我会在这失败
Why would I want to crash here

649
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,264
我还有个湖边小屋能待着，啊？
When I got a lake house to stay in, huh?

650
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:17,432
你是跟这躲事儿来了
You're the one who's in hiding.

651
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:18,750
杂种
Bastard.

652
00:33:18,768 --> 00:33:21,085
别这么说妈妈
Don't talk about mom that way.

653
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:24,105
怎回事？
the hell?

654
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,525
嘿！
Hey.

655
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,278
伙计们，最近怎么样？你们看什么呢？
Fellas, how's it going? What are you watching?

656
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:32,364
哦，三头呆鹅
Oh, the three stooges.

657
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:35,933
我喜欢丑角儿，哈？很好。
I love the stooges, huh? It's appropriate.

658
00:33:35,951 --> 00:33:39,320
两个小丑坐在电视机前看丑角儿
A couple of clowns sitting around watching the stooges.

659
00:33:39,372 --> 00:33:40,822
坐下
Sit down.

660
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:48,830
知道么，我对你们很失望
I want you guys to know I'm disappointed in you.

661
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:52,717
你，我救过你的命
You --I saved your life.

662
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:56,671
还有你，你们俩，我来跟你们做生意
And you -- both of you --I came up with a deal

663
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:58,840
能让你们赚大钱的生意
That's gonna make you a whole bunch of money.

664
00:33:58,891 --> 00:34:00,675
然后你们居然这么对我，啊？
And this is what you do to me, huh?

665
00:34:00,726 --> 00:34:02,477
你出卖我，还想杀我？
You set me up? You try to kill me?

666
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:04,679
你像个胆小鬼一样给我送来一颗炸弹
You send me a pipe bomb like some coward?

667
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,980
你什么意思？
What are you talking about?

668
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:08,149
你说是我送的炸弹？
You're telling --you're saying we sent the bomb?

669
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:09,851
胡说八道
That's --that's insane.

670
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:13,855
我能证明不是我们干的，你看这桌子上都摆着呢
I can prove it wasn't us.Look on the table here.

671
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:15,690
这是咱们的游戏机合同
It's our contract for the gaming machines.

672
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:17,975
在你被送炸弹之前
I signed them over to you two weeks ago --

673
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:21,479
我就签好了合同了
Before you got sent that bomb.

674
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:23,031
那又怎样？
So what?

675
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:29,037
那就意味着甭管你是不是死了，那些机器都属于你们公司的
So your company owns the rights to the machines even if you die.

676
00:34:29,088 --> 00:34:31,539
我为什么要杀你呢，我需要你
<i>Why would I kill you? I need you.</i>

677
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,007
那你是什么意思？
So, what are you saying?

678
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:36,094
你最近还没跟吉米・倪德思做成生意呢？
You haven't done any business with Jimmy Needles lately?

679
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:40,265
那也不是去炸你的餐馆啊
Not to blow up your place.

680
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:42,217
你的代号是不是4-4-7？
And your code's not 4-4-7?

681
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:47,439
怎么了？你看我干吗？
What? What are you looking at? 

682
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:48,940
那是我们的代码
That's our number.

683
00:34:48,974 --> 00:34:51,109
我什么也没干。他撒谎
I didn't do anything.He's lying!

684
00:34:51,143 --> 00:34:53,945
他没必要说谎，他手里攥着枪呢
He doesn't have to lie.He's holding a gun.

685
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:56,180
嘿，听我说
Hey, come on.Come on. Come on.

686
00:35:04,707 --> 00:35:08,877
你怎么看？
What about you?

687
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:18,086
我从来不想做这笔生意
I never liked the terms of our deal.

688
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,055
但是我默许了
But I accepted them.

689
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,475
我哥哥，做事太不小心
My brother --he didn't feel that way.

690
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:26,261
我从来没想过把你干掉
I never thought he would try to take you out.

691
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,382
我信你
I believe you.

692
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,886
真的，我信
Really, I do.

693
00:35:34,904 --> 00:35:37,272
那么，下一步你想怎么办？
So,what's your next move?

694
00:35:41,994 --> 00:35:47,115
我把他埋了，如果我们还在同一阵营的话
I'm gonna bury him outside, and if you and I are square...

695
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:50,668
那我们就继续做生意
...Then we're back in business.

696
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:55,239
当然，不过我要把你哥哥那份拿走
Of course, I'm gonna be absorbing your brother's shares.

697
00:35:55,257 --> 00:35:58,075
我相信他会理解的
I'm sure he would understand.

698
00:35:58,093 --> 00:35:59,744
那么，我们达成一致了？
So, we square?

699
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:02,263
是的
yeah.

700
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:05,383
请节哀
Sorry for your loss.

701
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,240
可能是通过未清洗的纹身针感染的
The infection could be from a dirty tatoo needle.

702
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,494
抗药金黄葡萄球菌？有可能
M.R.S.A.? Can't be.

703
00:36:17,528 --> 00:36:18,645
不发烧，白血球数量正常
No fever,normal white count.

704
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:22,115
没有发炎迹象
There's no evidence of cellulitis.

705
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,483
筋膜炎坏死？
Necrotizing fasciitis?

706
00:36:23,534 --> 00:36:25,485
那不足以解释为什么神经缺损
That doesn't explain the neuro deficits.

707
00:36:25,536 --> 00:36:27,771
会不会是肉毒杆菌？
What about botulism?

708
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:29,939
我是说，症状吻合
I mean, the symptoms fit --

709
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:32,108
虚弱，伴随倾斜性瘫痪
Weakness,then descending paralysis.

710
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:34,878
眼睛，上呼吸系统，然后是四肢
Eyes, respiratory, upper,then lower extremities,

711
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:35,996
而且我们还找到了病原
And we have a source.

712
00:36:36,047 --> 00:36:39,966
是，非常好，我们怎么确认它呢？
Yes, very good.How do we confirm it?

713
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:42,135
创伤培养
Culture the wound.

714
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,471
哦，送去做个肉毒杆菌化验
Uh, send out for a botulism assay.

715
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:47,891
等化验期间，我们再给他打大剂量的抗毒素
In the meantime, we'll dose him with heavy antitoxin.

716
00:36:47,925 --> 00:36:50,343
就这么干
Do it.

717
00:36:53,398 --> 00:36:56,850
嘿，格蕾丝
Hey. Grace.

718
00:36:56,901 --> 00:37:00,654
你还记得今天早上你看的那个病人吗？提芬尼・埃文斯
You remember that patient you saw this morning, Tiffany Evans?

719
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:02,639
记得，谎报病情，嗜药成瘾，怎么了？
Yeah, the addict who cries wolf. Why?

720
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:05,325
你误诊了，那是肠系膜动脉血栓
You missed a mesenteric artery thrombosis.

721
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,143
你做了CT检查？做了
You did a C.T.? Yeah.

722
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:09,413
我做了血栓切除术
And then I performed a thrombectomy.

723
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:10,697
她现在没事了
She's in recovery.

724
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:12,833
喔，你救了她一命
Wow. Then you saved her life.

725
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:15,585
除此之外，你还想跟我说什么
Not that you'll rub that in or anything.

726
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,204
是啊，也许有点想说的
Yeah,maybe a little bit.

727
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:20,657
天哪，这是第一次我站在她面前的时候命运捉弄了我
God, the one time I stand up to her, fate screws me.

728
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:22,709
但这次命运把咱们俩都捉弄了
But this time fate screwed us both.

729
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:26,663
她把你评定为服务不及格？
She flunked you on the survey?

730
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:28,164
手术之后，我把她推荐给一位疼痛处理专家
Post-surgery,I recommended her

731
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:31,835
为了解除对吗啡酮的药瘾
To a pain-management specialist，who took her off dilaudid.

732
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:40,944
嘿
Hey.

733
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:45,832
联邦法院就在那
Federal courthouse is right over there.

734
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:48,785
我爸曾经管它叫他的网球场
Dad used to call it his tennis court.

735
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:52,522
我和杰克管他叫麦肯罗，因为他允许我们逃学
Jack and I called him McEnroe 'cause he'd let us skip school

736
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,609
去看他和国防部律师在那擦地
To come watch him mop the floor with sleazy defense attorneys.

737
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:59,596
听上去你挺欣赏他
Sounds like you admired him.

738
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,965
那时候年轻
I was young.

739
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:13,209
六年之后，我妈被查出来乳房长了个肿块
Six years ago, my mother found a lump on her breast.

740
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:18,098
癌症
It was... Cancer.

741
00:38:18,149 --> 00:38:20,016
我爸爸让她延迟化疗时间
And my dad asked her to delay chemo

742
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,985
直到他得到听证会的结果
Until after his confirmation hearings

743
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:24,070
那样就不会
So that there wouldn't be the perception

744
00:38:24,105 --> 00:38:25,906
让他在工作上分心
That he was distracted.

745
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,657
哦
Oh.

746
00:38:27,692 --> 00:38:34,164
结果，她没有遵医嘱，延迟了五个星期
So, she delayed... Five weeks,against doctors' orders,

747
00:38:34,198 --> 00:38:40,253
然后淋巴结扩散了
And it... Spread...To her lymph nodes.

748
00:38:40,288 --> 00:38:44,758
我爸在她的葬礼上念了悼文
My dad gave the eulogy at her funeral.

749
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:46,426
他说我妈是他的灵魂伴侣
He said that she was his soul mate,

750
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,096
是他一生的挚爱
That she was the love of his life,

751
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:56,970
然后他哭了，然后上了时代周刊的封面
<i>And then he cried... And made the cover of Time magazine...</i>

752
00:38:57,004 --> 00:39:01,525
这个封面被镶上了镜框挂在他的办公室
Which is now framed in his office.

753
00:39:05,146 --> 00:39:06,780
干得好，鲁滨逊大夫
Good save,Dr. Robinson.

754
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:10,450
你弟弟对肉毒杆菌抗菌素
Your brother's responding to the botulism antitoxin

755
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:11,785
和抗生素有了反应
And antibiotics.

756
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:14,621
他已经可以拔掉呼吸器了
He's already off the vent.

757
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:19,125
抢救我还挺费劲的，哈？
I must have bit it hard, huh?

758
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,294
你的腕部骨折
compound wrist fracture.

759
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:23,463
我们必须得给你打了一颗钢钉
Ortho had to put a pin in it,so no, uh, strumming it

760
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:24,714
八周之后才能痊愈
For at least eight weeks,okay?

761
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:28,885
没事，我左右手都很灵活
Good thing I'm ambidextrous.

762
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,757
你的喉咙会因为插了呼吸管道有点疼
Your, uh, throat's gonna be sore from being intubated.

763
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:37,477
你感染了肉毒杆菌
So, you had a wound botulism.

764
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:39,813
这就是你昏迷摔倒的原因
That's why you lost control and crashed.

765
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:40,964
肉毒杆菌？
Botulism?

766
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:42,632
是从未消毒的纹身针上传染的
From a dirty tattoo needle.

767
00:39:45,903 --> 00:39:47,470
纹身还在
It's...Still there.

768
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:49,356
都谁知道这事了？
Who knows?

769
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:53,026
只有卡罗尔，还有你的医生
Just Carol...And your doctors.

770
00:39:53,077 --> 00:39:54,861
好吧，你说吧
So, let's hear it.

771
00:39:54,912 --> 00:39:56,646
说出来，你很震惊
Let's hear it.You're shocked.

772
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:58,648
你对我失望了
You're disappointed.

773
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,150
我很抱歉
No. I'm sorry, Jack.

774
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:04,671
只是很抱歉
Just... Sorry.

775
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:08,041
为什么？因为我过着你原本该过的生活？
For what? For living your life?

776
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:12,195
为了你离开爸爸道歉？
For getting the hell away from dad?

777
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,532
我真希望我有你一半的勇气
I wish I had half your guts.

778
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:23,940
现在怎么办？
So, what now?

779
00:40:23,975 --> 00:40:26,309
你要接受十天的抗生素治疗
You're on a 10-day regimen of antibiotics.

780
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:28,028
不是，我说的是家人
No, I meant with the family.

781
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:29,946
他们会问一些问题
They're gonna ask questions.

782
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:33,750
你想让我怎么回答？
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

783
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:41,074
他可能是开玉米罐头的时候
It's possible that he contracted the botulism

784
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:47,080
感染了肉毒杆菌，不过他不会有事的
From a dented can of corn, but he's gonna be okay.

785
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:49,749
你救了我儿子一命，大夫
You saved my son's life,doctor.

786
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,868
如果有什么我能帮得上忙的话
If there's ever anything you need...

787
00:40:51,886 --> 00:40:54,387
哦，这是我们的职责
Oh, it's --it's what we do.

788
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:57,373
别跟我们疏远了，好吗？
Don't be such a stranger, okay?

789
00:40:57,391 --> 00:40:59,542
好的
Okay.

790
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,227
谢谢你
Thank you.

791
00:41:03,514 --> 00:41:05,148
回见
Catch you later.

792
00:41:05,182 --> 00:41:06,816
好的
Okay.

793
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:07,984
好了，我该走了
All right,I should be going.

794
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:10,987
等等，孩子
Wait. Wait, son.

795
00:41:11,022 --> 00:41:14,407
我知道杰克没去托莱多
I know Jack wasn't in Toledo.

796
00:41:14,442 --> 00:41:19,429
我为你在家里主事的那种状态而自豪
I'm proud of the way you handled things -- with the family.

797
00:41:19,463 --> 00:41:23,249
爸，我不是对你撒谎
Dad,I didn't lie for you.

798
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:24,951
我是因为你才撒谎的
I lied because of you.

799
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:38,264
我想你肯定很渴
I thought you might be thirsty.

800
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:39,766
我给你买了个礼物
I brought you a gift.

801
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,601
哦，你的幽默感太怪了
Oh, you've got a sick sense of humor.

802
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:43,603
咱俩都一样
we both do.

803
00:41:43,637 --> 00:41:45,472
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

804
00:41:47,141 --> 00:41:48,441
砰
Boom.

805
00:41:48,476 --> 00:41:52,261
真可笑。哦，还挺凉的
Very funny.Oh, it's cold.

806
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:56,265
我听斯塔沃斯说你处理到了那个送炸弹的人
So, Stavos told me you took care of the bomber.

807
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:57,817
是我认识的人吗？
Do I know him?

808
00:41:59,704 --> 00:42:03,790
是，丹蒂・安马拓
Yeah. Dante Amato.

809
00:42:03,824 --> 00:42:07,711
这孙子居然背着他弟弟干这种事
And the bastard was even keeping it secret from his brother.

810
00:42:07,745 --> 00:42:09,713
嗯
Hmm.

811
00:42:09,747 --> 00:42:12,382
知道么，这是笔可笑的生意
You know,it's a funny business.

812
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:14,501
我们俩曾经是好朋友
He and I used to be good friends.

813
00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:18,471
我觉得你应该说句祝酒词
I think you should propose a toast.

814
00:42:18,506 --> 00:42:19,956
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

815
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:21,290
为什么不呢？
Why not?

816
00:42:21,308 --> 00:42:24,811
你有很多需要感谢的话要说
You got so much to be thankful for.

817
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:28,732
好吧，敬你脑子里想的那些事
Well, here's to what you got on your mind.

818
00:42:31,018 --> 00:42:32,135
对不起
Sorry.

819
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:33,486
现在不行，吉尔
Not now, Gio.

820
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:36,406
有人来找你了，头儿，他说有要紧的事
Somebody's here to see you,boss -- tells me it's urgent.

821
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,825
好吧，让他进来
All right.Let him in.

822
00:42:41,412 --> 00:42:45,198
我搜过他了，没事
He's clean.

823
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:47,650
我得私下里跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you --in private.

824
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:50,653
这人是谁啊？
Who the hell is this guy?

825
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:52,555
我从来没见过你
I've never seen you before.

826
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,491
好久没见了
It's been a long time.

827
00:42:55,509 --> 00:43:00,496
告诉你吧，小子
Let me tell you something, kid.

828
00:43:00,514 --> 00:43:02,382
我从来不会忘记任何一张脸
I never forget a face.

829
00:43:02,433 --> 00:43:04,834
那你再近看看
Then look closer.

830
00:43:06,804 --> 00:43:08,888
是我啊，爸爸
It's me, dad.

831
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
