gonna get into it.

184
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:16,386
When we first found
the flaw,

185
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:18,972
we shredded millions
of dollars' worth

186
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:20,757
of the New Benjamins.

187
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,309
It's what we
routinely do with any

188
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:23,844
worn or damaged
U.S. currency.

189
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:25,962
I'll keep this.

190
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,565
It's property
of the Treasury Department.

191
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,568
No. No, I-I don't think so...

192
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,604
Ashley Winter.

193
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:37,474
No, it's evidence in an
NCIS death investigation.

194
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,494
Records show that Noel Huffner

195
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:41,862
never gained access

196
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:43,813
to the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing building.

197
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,617
And we have not been able
to connect him to anyone there.

198
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:48,285
So how'd he get the bill?

199
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:49,786
Hey, guys!

200
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:51,622
Look who I found
down in the lobby.

201
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:53,874
Dad, what are you
doing here?

202
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:56,176
Ziva, show me some love.

203
00:08:56,178 --> 00:08:57,794
Oh!

204
00:08:57,796 --> 00:08:59,213
Dad, I thought you
were taking a cab

205
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:00,464
from the airport
to the hotel.

206
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,266
No hotel.

207
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:05,352
I came to spend Christmas
with you. Gibbs.

208
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:06,353
Good to see you, A.D.

209
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:07,354
Nice to see you.

210
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:09,106
Happy holidays, Mr. DiNozzo.

211
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:11,358
Same to you, Tim.

212
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,194
I don't understand.
Where are you staying?

213
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:16,012
At your place.

214
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,483
No! No, no, no, no.

215
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:21,351
Because it's...
it's not big enough.

216
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,654
Oh, come on, Junior.
You've got room.

217
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:25,021
Doesn't he?

218
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:31,962
Um, I...

219
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,915
I would not know.

220
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:37,000
I've never been invited.

221
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:39,970
Is that true?

222
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,372
What's the matter with you?

223
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,724
You're gonna be spending
the holidays together.

224
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:46,042
It's so sweet!
No.

225
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,311
Yes, of course.

226
00:09:47,313 --> 00:09:49,713
But not in...
because here's the thing.

227
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,848
It's a one-bedroom.

228
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,267
It's so small.

229
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:54,651
It's like a Habitrail.

230
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:57,187
But I'm gonna call
the Adams House.

231
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:00,390
I'm gonna get you a sweet suite,
my treat.

232
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,442
No, no, no, no, Junior,
I wouldn't hear of it.

233
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:04,328
I'll sleep on the couch
if I have to.

234
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,662
You <i>do</i> have a couch?

235
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:08,231
Happy holidays.
Adams House. Laurel speaking.

236
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,233
Come on, Tony.

237
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,901
Hello? Hello?

238
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,071
Okay, that'd be great.

239
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,341
So, you'll be joining us
Christmas Eve?

240
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:18,675
Oh.
Tony's started

241
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:19,793
this tradition
where we all watch

242
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:20,961
It's a Wonderful Life
together.

243
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:22,746
Abby, if you're
going to be there,

244
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,214
I wouldn't miss it.

245
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:28,185
Junior.
Dad.

246
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:33,023
I don't get it. Autopsy's done.

247
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:35,425
Usually Agent Gibbs
has been down here by now.

248
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:38,478
Methinks you have

249
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,397
just spoken of the devil,
Mr. Palmer.

250
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,949
What do we know?

251
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:44,318
Cause of death
was a broken neck.

252
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,772
Shattered the C-6
and C-5 vertebrae.

253
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,240
Almost severed
the spinal cord.

254
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:52,709
He didn't die
in that chair, Jethro.

255
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,661
It was definitely a homicide.

256
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:56,413
Anything else?

257
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:57,831
Well, although
it didn't kill him,

258
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,549
Mr. Huffner had
cirrhosis of the liver.

259
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:02,803
He was likely a
heavy drinker.

260
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,808
All right, here we are.

261
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:21,521
Junior... not what I expected.

262
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:23,106
Yeah, my girl,

263
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:24,641
there you go.

264
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:25,642
There's some treats.

265
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,860
That's my good girl.

266
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:29,112
You're getting fat.

267
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,001
My goldfish.

268
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:35,452
Her name is Kate.

269
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,461
How long have you lived here?

270
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:46,329
Almost 12 years.

271
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,799
You want to wash up
before we eat?

272
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:49,850
Sure.

273
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:52,853
Should we cook something here
or go out?

274
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:55,188
I don't really keep a lot
of food in the house, Dad.

275
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:01,945
We'll go out.

276
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:04,231
All right, Dad, you're
gonna stay in my room,

277
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:06,400
and I'll hit the couch.

278
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:12,789
That's your bed?

279
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,357
Yeah.

280
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,193
Not much room for play.

281
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,664
Well, when I come home,
Dad, I sleep alone.

282
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,332
You're serious?

283
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:26,202
Dad, this is my sanctuary.

284
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,704
Okay?

285
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,540
If I'm going to see a lady,
I will stay at her place.

286
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,376
That way,
I can leave when I want

287
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,563
and nobody overstays
their welcome.

288
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:40,717
What?

289
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,403
You're missing
so many things--

290
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:47,557
intimacy, commitment.

291
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,076
You know,

292
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:50,777
I'll see if we can
get a reservation

293
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:53,163
at the rooftop grill.

294
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:56,833
Hope it's not my fault.

295
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:58,285
Hey, this is
Anthony DiNozzo.

296
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:01,171
Can I get a table for
two up on the rooftop?

297
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,795
Abby... what are you doing?

298
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:10,046
Lifting prints.

299
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:13,433
This ornament has been
in my family since the 1890s.

300
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:15,084
It was my great-great-
grandmother's.

301
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,553
So I'm trying to identify

302
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:18,438
as many relatives that have
handled it as I can.

303
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,726
I already found my Great Uncle
Gooper and my Aunt Trixie.

304
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:23,777
Mm-hmm.

305
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:25,261
Ask her how she got a match.

306
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,731
I used to fingerprint all
my relatives at our reunions.

307
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:30,233
I started when I was
11 years old.

308
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:33,286
You got anything on
Huffner's computer or cell?

309
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:35,122
Uh, not really, but...

310
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:36,206
We have
something much,

311
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,824
much better.

312
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:40,494
Besides Noel Huffner's
fingerprint,

313
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:43,046
I also found someone else's
on this C-note,

314
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:45,499
and reliable old AFIS
got us a match.

315
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:47,167
You gonna give
me a name?

316
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:49,619
Second print belonged
to a Justin Cannady,

317
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,555
and it gets better, boss.

318
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,057
Not only did he
work at the Bureau

319
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:55,392
of Engraving and Printing;

320
00:13:55,394 --> 00:13:57,794
he was fired
from there last year.

321
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,298
Huffner was working
with an inside man.

322
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:22,495
Tony... you all right?

323
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:25,565
No. I slept
on the couch last night.

324
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,066
I got a kink
in my neck and kinks

325
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:29,085
in my back-- it's killing me.

326
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:30,452
What'd you find out?
Justin Cannady

327
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:31,911
was not at
his apartment.

328
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:33,481
Secret Service had the place
locked down

329
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,400
and would not let us in.
We should have searched

330
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:39,237
the place ourselves
before we told Agent Winter.

331
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,556
She issued a BOLO
but couldn't stop us

332
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:43,074
from questioning
Cannady's neighbors.

333
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,075
No one had seen
him in weeks.

334
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:46,293
You able
to connect Cannady

335
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:47,327
to our dead Navy husband?

336
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:48,962
Not yet.

337
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:52,415
So you have just been lying down
on the job while we were gone.

338
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:54,200
Timmy, remote.

339
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:57,504
Check out
his credit score.

340
00:14:57,506 --> 00:15:00,640
It's lower than McGee's
self-esteem in high school.

341
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:02,375
Cannady is broke.

342
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:03,426
Unemployment insurance

343
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:05,979
ran out last month,
car was repo'd,

344
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:08,264
he's two months behind
on his rent.

345
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:09,382
Gibbs.

346
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:11,017
Oh, my God.

347
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:14,688
Where did
that Susan B. Anthony dollar go?

348
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,573
She likes to roll.

349
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:20,727
Oh, Agent Winter,
what are you doing here?

350
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:23,196
I was summoned

351
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:24,614
to brief you.

352
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:26,065
Hmm.
Cannady worked

353
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,335
at the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing until last June.

354
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:29,753
Why'd he get fired?

355
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:30,737
Poor performance.

356
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:32,505
Tardiness and being
drunk on the job.

357
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:34,958
Cannady lost two fingers
in an accident.

358
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,593
Ouch.

359
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:38,211
He operated a shredding machine.

360
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:40,130
Assistant Director Linder
had to let him go.

361
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:41,414
Linder-- isn't that
the squirrelly guy

362
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,099
- that we talked to?
- Coworkers heard

363
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:44,801
from Cannady since?
No.

364
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:47,020
Is more money missing?

365
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:49,022
No way of telling.

366
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:50,590
You think Cannady killed
your Navy husband?

367
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:51,924
Your agents

368
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:53,593
turn up anything
at Cannady's apartment?

369
00:15:53,595 --> 00:15:54,594
No.

370
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:56,095
They tore
that place apart.

371
00:15:56,097 --> 00:15:58,064
I'd like to do the same
to Huffner's house.

372
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:01,317
No, that's not gonna
happen, Agent Winter.

373
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:03,620
That's on a
Navy base.

374
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:04,771
You handled
Cannady's apartment.

375
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:05,955
Now,

376
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:10,043
Special Agents DiNozzo and
McGee were just leaving.

377
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:12,111
It's always a pleasure.

378
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,114
<i>I went to use</i>

379
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:17,217
my credit cards at the
Navy Exchange this morning,

380
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:18,218
and they were
both declined

381
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,953
because my slug
of a husband drew

382
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:24,340
$5,000 against each
of the cards.

383
00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:26,793
He forged
my signature.

384
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:28,478
What was he up to?

385
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,513
That's what we're trying
to find out, Commander.

386
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,599
Well, do you at least
know how he died?

387
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:35,402
Yeah, he was murdered.

388
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:36,519
We suspect
he was involved

389
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,154
in criminal activity
with a man named

390
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:40,106
Justin Cannady.

391
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:42,826
Do you know him?

392
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,144
Never seen him.

393
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:47,447
You aware that your husband
had a liver condition?

394
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:48,948
No, but I'm not surprised.

395
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,083
He drank too much,

396
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:52,151
and I always knew
where to find him.

397
00:16:52,153 --> 00:16:54,421
Where was that?

398
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:56,756
Gillespie's Saloon
on Prescott Street.

399
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:59,125
So do you know
when I'm gonna be able

400
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:00,427
to get into my house again?

401
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:02,429
There are things
that I have to do.

402
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:06,332
We'll let you know
when we're finished.

403
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:12,388
Did you find anything
downstairs?

404
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,006
Done in the bedroom.

405
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:17,277
Yeah, well, you always
have to suspect the wife.

406
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,528
She was halfway
around the world.

407
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,679
She could have
hired someone.

408
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:23,399
Listen, I need you
to crack my back.

409
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:25,452
Go to a chiropractor.

410
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:27,153
I don't have time.

411
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:28,455
I need it now.

412
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:30,123
All right,
if I do it this once,

413
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,190
will you stop complaining?

414
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:32,408
No complaining.

415
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:37,380
You're a buddy.

416
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:39,382
Oh, that's good,

417
00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:40,333
that's good.

418
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:41,534
Okay, let me
just relax.

419
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:44,137
Now just give me
a little bounce.

420
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:46,473
Oh-ho-ho, aah!

421
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:48,007
One more.

422
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:50,426
More.

423
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:52,095
Oh!

424
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:53,680
Whose is that?

425
00:17:53,682 --> 00:17:55,732
It's mine.

426
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:57,684
Just put me down real slow.

427
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:58,718
Real slow.

428
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:04,157
Thank you. I'm a
little light-headed.

429
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:06,526
Hey, Dad.

430
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:08,328
Where do you keep
your roasting pan?

431
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:11,164
Dad, I don't have
a roasting pan.

432
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,365
I don't cook.

433
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:13,666
What are you doing?

434
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:16,035
I'm getting ready
for a traditional

435
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:17,787
DiNozzo Christmas dinner.

436
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:19,789
Takes days of prep.

437
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,341
Traditional dinner?

438
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:22,876
Listen, Dad,

439
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:24,410
can you hold
off, please?

440
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:26,462
'Cause I...
We'll talk about it tonight.

441
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:27,881
Okay?

442
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:34,103
You should appreciate
your father.

443
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:35,755
I never had family traditions.

444
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:38,441
Well, we haven't had them
for years.

445
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:42,312
Traditions kind of died
with my grandfather.

446
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:44,814
Senior was kind of
an absentee parent.

447
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:47,867
You know,
long-standing customs kind of...

448
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:50,770
disappeared.

449
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:54,440
Along with a certain
family signet ring.

450
00:18:54,442 --> 00:18:56,108
It was always
passed on

451
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,911
to the next generation
on the Christmas

452
00:18:57,913 --> 00:19:00,112
of the son's 21st birthday.

453
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:02,281
I never got it.

454
00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:04,784
Senior claimed it was stolen.

455
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:07,337
"I was mugged, Junior."

456
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:11,341
But I think he pawned it
during the bad times.

457
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:14,060
Hey, come over here and help me
with this, will you?

458
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:16,346
Sure.

459
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:18,514
Thank you for that, by the way.
Much better.

460
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:19,632
Yeah.

461
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:21,234
All right, we're gonna lift
this right here.

462
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:22,301
All right, ready?

463
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:25,188
One, two, three.

464
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,407
Oh, look at that.

465
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:53,165
They don't open till 4:00.

466
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,851
Maybe he's setting up.

467
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:56,836
Let's check around back.

468
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:04,060
Hello.

469
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:06,479
NCIS Special Agents Gibbs
and David.

470
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:07,847
You got a minute?

471
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:09,232
NCIS?

472
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:10,400
What's this about?

473
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:12,151
I'd like to talk to you
about Noel Huffner.

474
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:13,736
Okay.

475
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:15,705
Um, I got to open
in a half an hour.

476
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:17,790
You mind if we talk inside?
Nah.

477
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,191
I recognize the grill.

478
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:20,359
It's a '53, right?

479
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:21,711
It was my old man's.

480
00:20:21,713 --> 00:20:24,580
The original Gillespie,
he bought it new.

481
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:27,583
<i>Huffner's wife</i>
<i>said he's a regular here.</i>

482
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:28,801
Yeah.

483
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:31,137
And I've talked to her
a couple of times.

484
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:34,340
She calls here when he
won't answer his cell.

485
00:20:34,342 --> 00:20:36,092
Problems in the marriage?

486
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,511
I think I'm gonna invoke

487
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:39,812
bartender/patron
confidentiality.

488
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:41,731
I don't want
to get a regular in trouble.

489
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,549
You're not gonna
get Huffner in trouble.

490
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,567
He's dead.

491
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:46,385
Oh.

492
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:48,988
I guess that's why
I haven't seen him in a while.

493
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,323
He's a young guy.

494
00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:51,407
What happened?

495
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:52,525
Do you know him?

496
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:54,827
Yeah. Justin.

497
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:57,280
I don't think I ever heard
his last name before.

498
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:58,731
Justin and Huffner
know each other?

499
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:00,033
Oh, yeah.
The two of them

500
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:01,784
sit down there at
the end of the bar

501
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:04,203
just about every night,
like Cliff and Norm.

502
00:21:05,674 --> 00:21:07,173
I haven't seen Justin

503
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:08,574
in a while, either.

504
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:10,743
Well, if Justin comes in,

505
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:12,095
would you give us a call?

506
00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:15,048
Yeah, sure.

507
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,248
Hey, um...

508
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:19,135
You never told me how Noel died.

509
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:22,055
He was murdered.

510
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:30,897
What are you doing?

511
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:33,149
What's it look like?

512
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:35,785
Decorating the Christmas tree.

513
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:37,436
Beautiful, isn't it?

514
00:21:37,438 --> 00:21:39,238
Big, full, great.

515
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,324
You moved my piano.

516
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:44,077
Well, I had to put the tree
in the window.

517
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,748
Oh, what...
what happened in here?

518
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,333
Is this how you're
going to react

519
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:52,919
to all the hard work
I did today?

520
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:55,471
I baked your favorite
Christmas cookies.

521
00:21:55,473 --> 00:21:57,223
Snickerdoodles.

522
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:58,891
Used your mother's recipe.

523
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:00,927
I knew your staying
here was a mistake.

524
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:03,963
Look... this is my
apartment, okay?

525
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:05,515
This is my space.

526
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:07,633
Junior... chill.

527
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:08,968
Chill.

528
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,353
Get the Christmas spirit.

529
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:12,772
Tony?
I'll get it.

530
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:14,774
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Look,

531
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:16,526
we can't let her know
that we're here.

532
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:17,944
I know you're home, Tony.

533
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:20,196
Ignore her.

534
00:22:20,198 --> 00:22:21,531
Who is she?

535
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:24,283
She's the bloodhound from
across the hall. Shh.

536
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:32,875
Ooh, ooh.
Ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

537
00:22:32,877 --> 00:22:35,378
Have you closed
the deal on that?

538
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,496
Dad! Shh.

539
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:45,271
All right, listen,
something's come up at work.

540
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:48,274
I got to go.
Well, when will you be home?

541
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,476
I don't know.

542
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:00,403
Hikers found the body
just before sunset.

543
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:01,687
There's no I.D.

544
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:09,495
Duck, why'd the LEOs
think it was Cannady?

545
00:23:09,497 --> 00:23:14,050
He's missing the appropriate
two digits.

546
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:15,701
How long has he been dead?

547
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:19,038
Oh, I'd venture the same
amount of time as Mr. Huffner.

548
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,973
Oh, great!
I got my maggots!

549
00:23:22,427 --> 00:23:25,845
This is shaping up to
be one disgusting week.

550
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,767
Aw, hell.

551
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:33,052
Get the body into the van.

552
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:34,604
Don't need Agent Winter
snooping around.

553
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:35,855
Let's go, Mr. Palmer.

554
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:38,074
Chop-chop.
One, two, three.

555
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:39,775
Boss is gonna
head her off at the pass.

556
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:40,743
Hey, Winter.

557
00:23:40,745 --> 00:23:42,995
Agent Gibbs.
What do we got?

558
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:44,396
I don't know.

559
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:46,282
May or may not be Cannady.

560
00:23:46,284 --> 00:23:47,333
Oh. Huh.

561
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:48,618
Whoa, whoa,
I don't think

562
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,870
you're gonna make it down
that way in those heels.

563
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:53,372
No...
Come on, I'll show you a better way.

564
00:23:53,374 --> 00:23:54,373
Look--
it's right there.

565
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,409
And she's clueless.

566
00:23:58,578 --> 00:24:01,130
Agent Winter has no idea
what she's up against.

567
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:03,916
Nicely done.

568
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:05,468
Well, with Cannady dead,

569
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,753
we're looking for
another killer.

570
00:24:18,405 --> 00:24:20,723
Noel Huffner had $400,000

571
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,143
of the new, uncirculated
$100 bills

572
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:24,427
at his house.

573
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,230
And all the serial numbers
came from a batch that was

574
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,532
supposedly shredded
on May 2, 2011.

575
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,067
And Justin Cannady was working

576
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,469
at the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing as a shredder.

577
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,088
It is safe to say
he was involved.

578
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,239
Right. So the
questions are:

579
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,491
How much more
might have been stolen,

580
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:39,493
and how'd they get it out

581
00:24:39,494 --> 00:24:41,143
of such a heavily
secured building?

582
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:43,196
That a snickerdoodle?

583
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:44,447
Yes.

584
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,782
Where'd you get 'em?

585
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,451
Senior. He bakes.

586
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,036
Who knew?
Would you like one?

587
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:51,504
- Ziva?
-  No.

588
00:24:51,506 --> 00:24:54,541
Uh, so you think the $10,000
that Huffner borrowed

589
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:57,493
from the credit cards
has anything to do with this?

590
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,679
What if Huffner bought
some of the New Benjamins

591
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:02,048
at a discount
from his bar buddy, Cannady?

592
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,351
You know, like,
$10,000 for $400,000?

593
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:07,136
Think about it--
Cannady couldn't spend

594
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,672
any of the new currency until
it was put into circulation.

595
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,558
But he was in debt
and needed money.

596
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,444
Maybe he got antsy
and decided to...

597
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,197
sell some of the uncirculated
cash to Huffner.

598
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,816
Well, that may all be true,

599
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:23,019
but why are they both dead?

600
00:25:24,521 --> 00:25:26,522
What am I looking at?

601
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,492
Fibers, magnified
a thousand times.

602
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,461
These eensy-weensy
little buggers

603
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,330
were statically attracted
to the shrink-wrap

604
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,966
on the currency hidden
in Huffner's house.

605
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,367
What are the fibers?

606
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:39,535
Particles...

607
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,504
of shredded New Benjies.

608
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,473
The money was heavily
guarded in a vault

609
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,541
until some of it was
shredded for disposal.

610
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,093
Watch this.

611
00:25:48,262 --> 00:25:49,646
Voilà.

612
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,898
The New Benjies
left the building...

613
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,600
in the trash.

614
00:25:55,486 --> 00:25:58,220
Yeah, I know it's our first
Christmas as a married couple,

615
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:01,024
and I want it
to be special, but I...

616
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,575
Breena, I got to go.

617
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,029
Special Agent Winter, isn't it?

618
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,397
Is that the body I didn't
get to see last night?

619
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,950
Does Special Agent Gibbs

620
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:12,502
know that you're down here?

621
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,120
Have you
made a positive

622
00:26:14,122 --> 00:26:15,922
identification yet?

623
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:18,758
Well, you must understand
how difficult it is

624
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,093
to lift a fingerprint

625
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:21,243
from a body
that has been

626
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:22,879
exposed to the elements

627
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,131
for so long a time.

628
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:27,216
First, you must

629
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:30,520
carefully remove
the dermis.

630
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,925
Then, using your own
gloved hands,

631
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,861
you spread the dermis

632
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,613
over a corresponding finger.

633
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:44,600
Roll it in the ink

634
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,985
and then on paper.

635
00:26:45,987 --> 00:26:48,321
And have you been able...
I first used the process

636
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:49,539
when I was in India.

637
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,908
Yes, in the city of Allahabad.

638
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,875
Dr. Mallard,

639
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,294
cut the crap.

640
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:56,796
Tell me what you know.

641
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,632
If I find out you're impeding
a Secret Service investigation,

642
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:00,284
do you understand...

643
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:01,335
This is an
NCIS investigation,

644
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:04,053
and Dr. Mallard is doing exactly
what he needs to be doing.

645
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,472
I thought we were gonna work
with each other, Gibbs.

646
00:27:06,474 --> 00:27:08,174
We are.

647
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:09,759
Tell her what
you know, Duck.

648
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:12,962
We have
a positive identification.

649
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,964
This is Justin Cannady.

650
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,685
The cause of death,
cervical fracture.

651
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:21,654
Identical to Mr. Huffner's,
I might add.

652
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:24,140
Anything else?

653
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,658
Yeah, just got a lead.

654
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,160
We need to talk

655
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:28,578
to Assistant Director Linder.

656
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,163
Hmm.

657
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:31,814
You're not doing it without me.

658
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,867
Wouldn't think of it.

659
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,544
It's very unlikely
that any of the currency

660
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:46,212
was removed from the vaults.

661
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:49,382
I've got $400,000
of your new bills

662
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:51,267
at NCIS that says
you're wrong.

663
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,102
I don't know, okay?

664
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,855
All bills that are removed
from the vaults are shredded,

665
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:58,340
compacted into bales
and disposed of.

666
00:27:58,342 --> 00:27:59,559
Where?

667
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:01,177
That was a year and a half ago.

668
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,696
We have contracts with several
different landfills.

669
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:06,032
Okay, well, we'll narrow it
down for you, Donald.

670
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:08,350
Which one was used
on May 2 of last year.

671
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:12,238
Be assured we're gonna be

672
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,740
shaking up things
in this department.

673
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:20,529
Try the Adams County Landfill
in Virginia.

674
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,869
Thanks, Chris. Hi, Santa.

675
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,254
Hi, sweetheart.

676
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:29,205
Mwah.

677
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,539
Tony's out
in the field.

678
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,508
Did he know you were coming?
No, I'm, uh,

679
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,560
here to deliver presents.

680
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:36,179
Ah.

681
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:40,433
And this is for you,
my dear.

682
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:42,602
Thank you.

683
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:44,487
Even though I do not
celebrate Christmas,

684
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,689
I love the
holiday season,

685
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,724
and I'm very glad
you and Tony

686
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,326
are going to be together.

687
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,028
I'm not so sure that, uh,

688
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,830
Tony feels that way.

689
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,615
Things not going well?

690
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:56,783
I think I'm trying

691
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:59,335
to make up
for too many missed Christmases

692
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,837
all at once.

693
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:05,407
Well, maybe you're
trying too hard.

694
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:08,410
Well, Junior's the only
family I have left.

695
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:10,630
After his mother died,

696
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:13,966
it... it just hasn't
been the same.

697
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:16,185
He showed me a
picture of her.

698
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,754
She was really
beautiful.

699
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:22,442
Mm-hmm, inside and out.

700
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:26,062
She was the love
of my life, Ziva.

701
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:29,431
I've never been able
to fill up that void.

702
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:33,319
But God knows I've gotten
into a lot of trouble trying.

703
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,124
Timmy?

704
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,559
Stewie?

705
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,060
Hey, man.

706
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,228
How are you?

707
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,563
Hey, man.
Hey, man.

708
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,631
Good to see you.

709
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:04,767
You guys know each other?

710
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,068
Yeah, we went to
school together.

711
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,270
M.I.T.

712
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,688
M.I.T.?

713
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,807
And now you work... here.

714
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,475
Last I heard,
you were teaching

715
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:15,495
computational
evolutionary biology.

716
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:17,113
I was.

717
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,698
Burnt out, man,

718
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,416
but I found my calling, trash.

719
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,484
Crazy, huh?

720
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:24,120
You know you can learn
more about mankind

721
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,338
by what it throws away

722
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,989
than you can in any classroom?

723
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:28,841
What are you doing, Timmy?

724
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:30,927
I'm a federal agent, NCIS.

725
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,795
Shut up. No way.

726
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,597
Whoa!

727
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,215
You're packing a gun.

728
00:30:36,217 --> 00:30:38,434
This was one crazy dude
in college.

729
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,169
Really knew how to have
a good time.

730
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,605
Shut up. No way.

731
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,106
Did he tell you he was
the school mascot?

732
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,142
No.

733
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,310
What was

734
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,844
the M.I.T. mascot?

735
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:49,779
Really doesn't matter.

736
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,847
Oh, yes, it does.
Stewie?

737
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,182
A beaver.

738
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,951
He was Tim the Beaver
our senior year.

739
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,737
Please tell me you dressed up
like a beaver.

740
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,038
Of course he did.

741
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,522
Little teeth, just...

742
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:01,574
Remember the...

743
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:04,627
Oh.

744
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,045
Yeah.

745
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:07,747
Listen, Stewart, we're
trying to track down

746
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:09,081
a batch of
shredded currency

747
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,217
that came from the Bureau
of Engraving and Printing

748
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:13,202
on May 2, 2011.

749
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:17,206
Let's see, May 2, 2011, uh,

750
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,708
that'd be in G sector,
and by now,

751
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,427
about 30 feet under.

752
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:23,145
Uh, we had a break-in
that night.

753
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,648
Police came to investigate,
shared a laugh.

754
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,850
What would anyone steal
from the dump?

755
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,319
I think we may have the answer.

756
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,888
Yeah, I know you're
a smart guy, Stewie,

757
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,441
but how do you remember
the exact date of the break-in?

758
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:37,726
Everybody remembers
where they were that day.

759
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,728
Don't you? It was the night

760
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,781
the Navy SEAL team
took out bin Laden.

761
00:31:55,796 --> 00:31:57,847
Dad?

762
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,016
Junior?

763
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,602
Wow.

764
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:04,770
This looks fantastic.

765
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:07,440
What do you think, Kate?

766
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:09,758
I didn't even know
it could look like this.

767
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:13,229
Candles and everything.

768
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,032
You know, you were right.

769
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,984
This was a good idea.

770
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:20,369
Thank you.

771
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,654
Hey, listen.

772
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:23,539
Maybe you want to grab
some dinner?

773
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,658
Uh, I'll be right with you.

774
00:32:39,172 --> 00:32:41,290
Didn't expect you back so soon.

775
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,893
Obviously.

776
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,062
Didn't mean for you to see that.

777
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,680
Oh.

778
00:32:47,682 --> 00:32:50,733
It's forever etched
into my retinas.

779
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:53,019
Hi, Tony.

780
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:54,236
Hi.

781
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,072
Call me later.

782
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,749
I'll have to burn the bed now.

783
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,168
Aw, come on, Junior.

784
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,287
Don't make a big deal
out of this.

785
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,255
Well, you nearly pulled it off.

786
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,623
You know?

787
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,492
It was almost like old times.

788
00:33:17,844 --> 00:33:20,662
Have to go just
a little too far.

789
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,264
Ah.

790
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,266
What can I say?

791
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,268
I'm me.

792
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,270
I'm not going to change.

793
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,389
I know.

794
00:33:30,391 --> 00:33:32,525
I know you're not
going to change.

795
00:33:32,527 --> 00:33:34,477
And I don't know
why I was smiling,

796
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,179
'cause there's nothing funny
about this.

797
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,847
Dad, this is my home.

798
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:40,983
I told you,

799
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,569
my rules, okay?
Uh-huh.

800
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:45,621
And you broke them.

801
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:52,578
It was a mistake
having you here for Christmas.

802
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,665
You want me to leave?

803
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,031
Aren't you gonna
open your cookies?

804
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,650
I thought you were not supposed

805
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,602
to open presents until...
Christmas morning.

806
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:18,971
Snickerdoodles don't count.

807
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,975
I'm worried.

808
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,311
About Tony and his father.

809
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,478
Did he say what happened?

810
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,197
No.

811
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,915
Just that it was complicated.

812
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:30,866
Where's DiNozzo?

813
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,168
He's on his way.

814
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,786
What did you find out
at the landfill?

815
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:35,287
They had a break-in.

816
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:37,289
Security cameras?
No.

817
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:39,258
Not much there worth protecting.

818
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,960
Boss, do you remember
that night?

819
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:42,494
May 2, 2011?

820
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:43,829
No.

821
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,047
Bet you do.

822
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:48,050
It's the night
Navy SEALs killed bin Laden.

823
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,674
So we raid Abbottabad,

824
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,110
and we kill the most
wanted man in the world.

825
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:01,030
Got to think Homeland
put the DC area

826
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,898
on high alert
and increased surveillance.

827
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,283
Yeah.

828
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:06,184
They have to be concerned
about retaliation.

829
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:09,738
I should get some credit.

830
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,290
I fired Justin last June.

831
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:12,741
The damage was done
by then, Linder.

832
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,044
And, as assistant director
of operations, you're going

833
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,630
to be held responsible.

834
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,631
Winter.

835
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,216
Hey, it's Gibbs.

836
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,534
Secret Service
is under Homeland now.

837
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:24,136
Let me guess, Agent Gibbs.

838
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:25,804
You need something.

839
00:35:25,806 --> 00:35:27,523
We need to access

840
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,175
archival satellite surveillance
of the DC area.

841
00:35:30,177 --> 00:35:31,594
What's going on?

842
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,647
I'll make some calls.

843
00:35:45,692 --> 00:35:48,560
I can give you a ride
to the airport.

844
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:50,729
Ah, no, no, you're...

845
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,898
you're already late for work.

846
00:36:02,408 --> 00:36:04,576
Sorry things didn't work out.

847
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,463
Me, too.

848
00:36:16,473 --> 00:36:19,424
Bye, Junior.

849
00:36:29,819 --> 00:36:32,237
Can you enhance it?

850
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,572
It's nighttime, Gibbs.

851
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:35,107
We can try.

852
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:38,661
Going in tighter and enhancing.

853
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:42,665
Sorry I'm late, boss.

854
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,916
Your dad?

855
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:47,920
Yeah, well, we hit
a little bump in the road.

856
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:50,122
Oh, no, but he can't miss
the Christmas Eve party.

857
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,124
Sorry, Abbs.

858
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,726
Where is he?

859
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:56,512
He is on his way
to the airport.

860
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,565
He's going back
to New York.

861
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:05,254
It's a little better.

862
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:09,391
Well, it looks like a pickup
truck, but because of the

863
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,693
lack of light
and angle, I can't get

864
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,277
a read on the license plate.

865
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:13,979
Uh, I don't need it.

866
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:24,707
Hey!

867
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,459
NCIS. Merry Christmas.

868
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:29,211
You're closing
early today, Gillespie.

869
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,046
I am?

870
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,549
We have a warrant to search
the premises and your residence.

871
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,184
What are you looking for?

872
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,520
Uncirculated
$100 Treasury notes.

873
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:39,938
Merry Christmas, gentlemen.

874
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,357
Drinks are on the house.

875
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,192
Wait, what
are you doing?

876
00:37:45,678 --> 00:37:48,030
This photo was taken
at a Virginia landfill

877
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,232
the night
the money went missing.

878
00:37:51,684 --> 00:37:53,485
Looks a lot like your truck.

879
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:55,904
Just your luck Big Brother
was watching that night.

880
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,690
The two figures--
you and Justin Cannady?

881
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:02,378
Or did Cannady do it alone
'cause he was broke

882
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,695
and tired of waiting?

883
00:38:03,697 --> 00:38:06,198
He sell some of his share
to Huffner without telling you?

884
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:10,469
Is that why
you killed them?

885
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:12,638
You worried that they
were gonna blow it for you?

886
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,540
No, uh...

887
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,425
Hey!
Retired Marine?

888
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,760
Yeah, so?

889
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,845
You had access
to the base at Pax River.

890
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:22,181
We'll get the video,
and we'll place you there.

891
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,382
Once we find the money,
it will all fall into place.

892
00:38:24,384 --> 00:38:26,101
Look, we can do this
the easy way

893
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:29,438
or the hard way, but we're not
leaving here without the money.

894
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:38,563
Oh, is she getting warmer,
Gillespie?

895
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:41,200
Oh...

896
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:44,236
that got
your attention.

897
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:52,678
There's a safe
in my office closet.

898
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,798
Stealing the money
your idea?

899
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,600
It sure as hell wasn't that
drunk Justin Cannady's idea.

900
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,637
Yeah, but you needed him
to pull it off. Ziva?

901
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,857
There's a safe
in the closet.

902
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:17,102
Come on.

903
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,707
Hey, you know,
we can wrap this up

904
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,492
and still have time
for the screening in MTAC.

905
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,827
I'm really not in the mood.

906
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,079
Come on, Tony,
it'll cheer you up.

907
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,781
Yeah, I left the DVD
in my apartment anyway.

908
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:31,500
So go get it.

909
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:21,466
♪

910
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:45,991
Not only were we able to recover
several million dollars

911
00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:48,243
of stolen,
uncirculated currency,

912
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,463
but two murders were solved
in the process.

913
00:40:51,465 --> 00:40:52,697
Are there any questions?

914
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:53,865
Yeah, I got one.

915
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:56,635
You get any help from NCIS?

916
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:58,921
Can you believe it?
She did not even mention us.

917
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,473
Ah, it's Christmas,
Ziva-- let it go.

918
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:03,091
Our gift to her.

919
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:06,311
Yes, the mulled cider
is good this year,

920
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:08,096
but it's not
quite the same.

921
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,815
I tried to remember
how Tony made it.

922
00:41:09,817 --> 00:41:12,267
Maybe I left something out.

923
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,320
Probably the seven
pods of cardamom?

924
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:17,856
Don't even know
what that is, Tony.

925
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:20,525
Neither do I, to
tell you the truth.

926
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:22,027
Sorry I'm late.

927
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:24,729
I got distracted.

928
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:26,731
Even when he's not around,

929
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,867
Senior can have
an effect on me.

930
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:32,070
Look what I found
under the tree.

931
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,590
Oh, the family ring.

932
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,958
Mm-hmm.

933
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,427
It's beautiful.

934
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:42,097
That's why he was here.

935
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,601
He wanted to make amends,
and I blew it.

936
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:48,420
That's Abby.

937
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,472
May I see it?

938
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,441
Yeah. It's got
a diamond.

939
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,609
You know, the origin

940
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,593
of signet rings
dates back

941
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:57,813
to ancient Mesopotamia.

942
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:01,199
Royalty used them to
authenticate and seal documents.

943
00:42:05,288 --> 00:42:07,122
Hope you didn't start
the movie yet.

944
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:11,827
Got something
for you, DiNozzo.

945
00:42:12,874 --> 00:42:15,007
Thanks, Gibbs.

946
00:42:17,794 --> 00:42:20,680
Merry Christmas, everyone.

947
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:23,828
Hey, Dad.

948
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:31,247
Thanks.

949
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,751
Merry Christmas.

950
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:43,909
I love you.

951
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:47,246
I love you, son.
