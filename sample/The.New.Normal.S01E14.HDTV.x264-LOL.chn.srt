00:00:07,063 --> 00:00:08,809
噢 好极了 你又游手好闲
Oh, good, you're doing nothing.

2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,125
我在看季后赛呢
I'm watching the playoffs.

3
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,149
上周日你也是这么说的
That's what you said last Sunday.

4
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:12,199
嘿...
Hey...

5
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:13,934
随便吧 反正我可是绞尽脑汁在想
Anyway, I've been kicking around some ideas

6
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:15,286
怎么通知亲朋好友我们的弄璋之喜
for birth announcements.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,905
我只需要你再多签一个名
I just need you to sign off on one more thing.

8
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:20,958
你想要的都行 是在...
I'm sure whatever you want is fine, it's...

9
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:24,161
尼玛这是何物?
What the hell is that?

10
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:26,914
这是他受洗的时候拍照要穿的行头
It's his wardrobe for the christening announcement photo.

11
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:29,667
我勒个去
Oh, no.

12
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:31,452
我儿子可不穿那玩意儿
My son is not wearing that.

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,787
哦 别急别急 如果你担心这是个二手货的话
Oh, no, no, no... if you're afraid it's derivative,

14
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:34,955
这只是故意弄成这样的
it is intentionally so.

15
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:36,069
这可是以弗朗西斯・福特・科波拉
It is modeled after

16
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,211
导演的《德古拉伯爵》中
Lucy Harker's funeral gown

17
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:38,676
露西・哈克的寿衣为原型制作的
from Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula.

18
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:39,721
好好瞧瞧嘛 大卫
Good eye, David.

19
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:41,312
我儿子可不穿连衣裙 布莱恩
My son is not wearing a dress, Bryan.

20
00:00:41,346 --> 00:00:42,630
这可不是连衣裙
It is not a dress.

21
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:44,965
这是具有划时代意义的经典晨衣
It is a classic turn of the century dressing gown.

22
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:47,318
是随处可见的婴儿装 而且很多夫妇
They were very common infant attire and a lot of parents

23
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:49,186
都让宝宝在弄璋弄瓦之喜和受洗礼上穿哦
still use them in birth and christening announcements.

24
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:50,821
我只是希望他第一个生日上
I'm just kind of hoping to get to his first birthday

25
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:52,156
不会有人叫他"小基"
without him being called "a baby homo."

26
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,408
谁会管一个婴儿叫"小基"
Who would call an infant "a baby homo"

27
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:56,827
难道是小版米歇尔・巴克曼不成?
except for a toddler Michele Bachmann?

28
00:00:56,862 --> 00:01:00,331
大卫 人不靠衣装
David, clothes do not define what somebody is.

29
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:02,033
我是说 你瞧瞧我
I mean, look at me.

30
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:03,484
如果要你就我的穿着
If you had to pick what my sexuality was

31
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:05,369
判断我是直的还是弯的 你怎么看?
based on what I was wearing, what would you say?

32
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,254
娘炮版巴格・范斯
Lesbian bagger vance.

33
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:09,490
我喜欢你的打扮 我只是觉得
I love the way you dress, I'm just saying we have

34
00:01:09,508 --> 00:01:11,709
我们要对自己给孩子的印象格外小心
to be careful about what kind of impression we put out there.

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,644
- 你想说啥? - 我想说人们第一反应
- Meaning what? - Meaning that people make snap judgments

36
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:14,828
总是以貌取人
based on appearances

37
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:16,764
这有可能会影响宝宝的一生
and it could affect him for the rest of his life.

38
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:19,517
好吧 如果你不喜欢我的想法
Fine, if you don't like my idea,

39
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:20,935
那你就自己想一个吧
come up with one of your own.

40
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:26,378
另类家庭 第一季第十四集


41
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:30,678
你好哇
Hello.

42
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:32,179
欢迎光临
Welcome.

43
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:34,281
简・福雷斯特 精致的房产
Jane Forrest, exquisite properties

44
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:35,366
总有一款适合您
for appropriate buyers.

45
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,351
额滴神呀 这里咋死气沉沉的
My God, it's dead in here.

46
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:39,537
像极了鬼屋
It's more like a haunted open house.

47
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:42,156
而你就是其中的一只鬼
And you must be one of the ghosts.

48
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,407
从你的装束看
Judging by your outfit,

49
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,376
不得不说就像阿尔戈号建成的那个年代
I'd say you died around the time argo was set.

50
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,495
我就这么穿了
I am dressed as what I am,

51
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:49,246
好的房产中介就该这么穿
which is a damn good real estate agent.

52
00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:51,248
现在你是想在这看房
Now, are you here to view the property

53
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,384
还是想在这里大放厥词?
or just to air out those dazzling new tooth caps of yours?

54
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:55,553
噢 放轻松 小简 我是布赖斯
Oh, relax Janey, I'm Brice.

55
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:57,221
南希・奈尔斯的经纪人助理
Nancy Niles' broker associate.

56
00:01:57,255 --> 00:01:59,873
她让我来看看你第一个开放参观日怎么样
She sent me here to check out your first open house.

57
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:02,560
让我们瞧瞧
Let's see.

58
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:05,646
看到没? 我刚刚...溜了一圈
You see that? I just... I just cruised myself.

59
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:06,931
简直就像个希腊之神
I am literally a Greek God.

60
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:08,215
你说我的
Tell me, does this

61
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,817
内裤是不是显得我很大呢?
pant make my package look too big?

62
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:13,070
显然和你的自负相比是相形见绌了
Certainly pales in comparison to the size of your ego.

63
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:14,605
好了 非常感谢你 普赖斯
Now, thank you very much, Price...

64
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,608
是布赖斯...和达拉斯・霍华德一个名字
Brice... as in Dallas Howard.

65
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:18,909
简 告诉我
So, Jane, tell me.

66
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:20,661
你想在哪开始你的房地产事业?
Where'd you get your start in real estate?

67
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:21,946
- 俄亥俄州 - 没错
- Ohio. - Right.

68
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:23,230
我敢说 这新鲜出炉的
And I bet the smell

69
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:24,231
曲奇香味就是
of these cookies baked fresh from a tube

70
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:25,499
你的秘密武器?
is your secret weapon?

71
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,034
- 没错 - 大错特错
- Yes. - No.

72
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:29,236
听着 这里是洛杉矶 这只会让你的客户
See, here in L.A. it's just a reminder of your client's

73
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:30,404
饮食失调 但是呢
eating disorder, but see

74
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:31,922
这不是让人们离开你的
that is not what's driving people

75
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:33,073
开放参观的原因
away from your open house.

76
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:35,426
好吧 别卖关子了 那是什么原因?
Okay, I'll bite... what is?

77
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,212
我们是可以随便涂层新的涂料
Well, we could quickly slap on a fresh coat of paint,

78
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:42,133
但我认为真正的原因在于基础
but I think the real problem lies within the foundation.

79
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:45,085
我是说 整个设计方案俗不可耐 陈旧过时
I mean, the whole design scheme is so tacky and outdated.

80
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:47,888
你脑残吗? 我们又不可能让栋房子活过来
Are you insane? We can't flip an entire house.

81
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:50,891
别走神 宝贝 我不是说房子
Keep up with me, honey... I'm not talking about the house.

82
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:52,810
我是说你
I'm flipping you.

83
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,928
真高兴和你见面 仙妮娅
It was so nice meeting you, Shania.

84
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:56,147
希望这个既定旅程玩得高兴
I hope you had fun on the set tour,

85
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:58,032
虽然我通常
though I don't normally

86
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,600
不怎么高兴
give it myself.

87
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:01,185
作为我老板代孕人的孩子
There are special privileges that come

88
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,204
当然会有些优待啦
with being the kid of my boss's surrogate.

89
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:04,955
你没其他孩子了是吧?
You don't have any more children, do you?

90
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,873
噢 没了
Oh, no.

91
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:07,441
好的 一会见啦
Okay, see you guys later.

92
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,110
嘿 姑娘们 抱歉打扰啦 照片十分钟后就好
Hey, girls, hate to interrupt but picture's up in ten

93
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:11,962
我们的明星需要补补妆
and our star needs to be touched up.

94
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:13,714
油脸可摸不上粉
Oily faces don't powder themselves.

95
00:03:13,749 --> 00:03:14,715
是啊
No, they don't.

96
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,333
拜拜
Bye.

97
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:19,637
噢 我看起来怎么样?
Oh, how do I look?

98
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:20,638
很棒
Great.

99
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:22,006
我牙齿里没卡东西吧?
Is there something in my teeth?

100
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:23,957
- 有口气吗? - 你刚吃腊肠了么?
- How's my breath? - Did you eat bologna?

101
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:25,959
那是克里斯
That's Chris.

102
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:26,960
他是一名场务
He's a grip.

103
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:28,562
- 什么是场务? - 你问倒我了
- What's a grip? - Got me.

104
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:29,563
我们还有点事要说
We have a bit of a thing going.

105
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:31,682
噢 嗯 达尼尔怎么样了?
Oh, um, what about Darnell?

106
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:34,068
我以为你们还热乎着呢
I thought you guys were hot and heavy.

107
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:35,936
我们关系更进一步后 达尼尔总是像辆
Well, when things got intimate, Darnell kept taking

108
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,822
开往市中心的公交车 没错我是喜欢
the bus downtown, which I do like,

109
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,740
但是他总是该停站的时候不停
but he never got off at the right stop.

110
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:42,243
结果一路开到了贫民区
He kept taking it all the way to skid row.

111
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:44,195
我都没法和他对视了
I couldn't look him in the eye anymore,

112
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:45,913
- 明白我在说什么吧? - 完全不明白
- you know what I'm saying? - Not at all.

113
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:48,365
- 嘿 小女孩 - 嘿
- Hey, baby girl. - Hey.

114
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,501
嘿 亲亲 MUA MUA
Hey. Kisses... mm-wah, mm-wah.

115
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:53,320
两件事... 第一 你看起来惊艳至极
Two things... number one, you look stupid fierce.

116
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:55,489
第二 我们有约了... 玛莉・布莱姬
Number two, we have a date... Mary J. Blige

117
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:58,209
在那玩手机呢 不准说不 还有
is playing at the Nokia, no is not an option, and...

118
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,493
不准谈电视剧
No more drama.

119
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:03,597
不介绍介绍这两位可爱的小姐吗?
Aren't you gonna introduce me to these two lovely ladies?

120
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:04,765
噢 克里斯 他们是我的朋友
Oh, Chris, these are my friends.

121
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,267
格尔蒂和仙妮娅
This is Goldie and Shania.

122
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,168
我猜你一定让男孩子们伤心欲绝吧
I bet you break boys' hearts left and right.

123
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:09,670
你难道不懂么 姐们儿?
Don't you know it, girlfriend?

124
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:11,438
我们找天出去钓凯子吧
We should go out boy-hunting sometime.

125
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:14,441
有点早熟是吧?
Isn't she precocious?

126
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:15,609
这词她四岁的时候教我的
She taught me that word when she was four.

127
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:17,144
好吧 我要回去工作了
Yeah, well, I better get back to work.

128
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,229
我要去控制摇臂
I got a jib arm to rig.

129
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,234
你什么意思 说要和我的男朋友
What was that, saying you want to go hunting

130
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:24,852
出去钓凯子?
for boys with my boyfriend?

131
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,120
罗基 我只是开玩笑罢了
Rocky, I was kidding.

132
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:27,738
我还太小 进不了同志吧
I'm too young to get into gay bars.

133
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:30,457
好了 照片好了
All right, picture's up.

134
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:34,795
好的 我们要让她的样子更现代
Okay, we want to upgrade her look.

135
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,664
但别弄那些非主流
But I don't want anything crazy.

136
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:37,731
你已经很非主流了 女士
Crazy is what you've got, girl.

137
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:39,360
我明白 但是这造型略显单薄
I know, it's so brittle, I just want

138
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,872
我想试试更短的造型 蒸片刻后
To snap it off, boil it in water

139
00:04:40,872 --> 00:04:41,991
接着加点别的花样儿
And put marinara on it.

140
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,865
- 宝贝 瞧你这嘴皮子功夫 - 你懂个屁
- Baby, the way your tongue works. - You don't know the half

141
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:49,063
你可以弄点纹理和小卷
Maybe you just try adding a little texture and swing.

142
00:04:49,183 --> 00:04:50,520
我妻子弄得就很性感
It looks hot on my wife.

143
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,190
这样头发披下来适合工作
It's easy to wear it down for work.

144
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,227
扎起来可以在家追孩子
Or tie it up for chasing our kids around the house.

145
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:57,562
我们就稍微弄点层次感
I say we do some subtle layering.

146
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:59,731
凸显你的下颌线
Something to highlight your great jaw line.

147
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:02,255
娜塔莎 原来你头发那么软啊
Natasha, I never noticed how soft you hair is.

148
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,254
不告诉我你护发素的牌子我就不走
Don't let me leave without the name of your conditioner.

149
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:05,439
还有你的手机号
And your phone number.

150
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,425
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

151
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:10,644
当然是希望能拿到她的电话啊
Hopefully getting her number.

152
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:12,262
你把这当作游戏?
And it's a game?

153
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,231
亲爱的 这当然是个游戏啊
Oh, sweetheart, it's definitely a game.

154
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:15,949
是嘛 那你期望的结局是?
Uh-huh, to what end?

155
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,534
结局嘛... 我咋知道
To what... I don't know.

156
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,454
可能是共进晚餐 看场电影 或者一切随天意
Go to dinner, a movie, or see where the night takes us.

157
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:23,206
爷可是有艘船呢
I have a boat.

158
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,708
你有没有站在她的角度想过?
Are you even thinking about her?

159
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,209
你有没有考虑过她的想法?
What about her feelings?

160
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:27,461
如果她是真的喜欢你呢?
What if she likes you?

161
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,279
你是不是被这里的烟熏晕了?
Is it the fumes in here?

162
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:31,715
我知道雷伯恩用的是两步法的乳化染色剂
I know rayburn uses a two-step emulsifying bleach.

163
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,467
得了吧 你这种人我见多了 布赖斯
Please, I know you, Brice.

164
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:36,053
你和我老公就是一个类型的人
I was married to a man just like you.

165
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,839
我觉得你既残忍又自私
And I think you are cruel and you are selfish.

166
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,724
如果你是正人君子的话
And if you were a decent human being,

167
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,309
就不会去骚扰那个女孩
you would leave that young girl alone

168
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,894
而是集中精力找你的同道中人
and stick to your own kind.

169
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,512
我的同道中人?
What's my own kind?

170
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:47,647
- 基佬 - 我才不是基佬呢
- Gay. - I'm not gay.

171
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:50,016
少装了 你手上戴着的链子可出卖了你
Oh, please, you are wearing a bracelet.

172
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:52,152
简 时代不同了
Jane, it's a new world.

173
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,820
你不能再因为一个男人对时尚和文化感兴趣
Just because a guy's into fashion and culture

174
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,856
或是他的发型 就断言他是基佬了
and hair processing doesn't make him gay.

175
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:57,074
我可听到了哟
Hear, hear.

176
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,312
你说大卫是抽的哪门子风?
I mean, what is David's problem?

177
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,997
这件可爱的晚礼服无论穿在
That's a perfectly lovely gown

178
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,749
男孩或者女孩身上都很好看
for a boy or a girl.

179
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,702
额 在这件事上我也许比较同意大卫的看法
Um, I think I might have to side with David on this one.

180
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,538
这衣服是有点... 女性化?
It's a little... girly?

181
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,823
那又怎样? 一个人的穿着没必要
Well, so what? I mean, clothing doesn't necessarily

182
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,425
体现出性别之分吧
have to indicate gender.

183
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,553
话是这样说 但是...
Right, but, um...

184
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:18,044
并不是每个人都能像你这样前卫
Most people aren't that evolved.

185
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:19,379
他们一般靠的就是第一印象
They go with their first impressions

186
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,663
第一印象不好 就会造成孩子心灵的创伤
and sometimes that can hurt.

187
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,168
我要和你家孩子聊聊
I need to talk to the child.

188
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,938
小屁孩 你竟然觉得
Child, you have lost your damn

189
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:32,008
我男朋友克里斯是基佬 你脑子是被门夹了吧
stinking mind suggesting that my boyfriend Chris is a homosexual.

190
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:33,046
这么说他不仅没出柜
Oh, so he's secretly gay,

191
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:34,861
而且还和女人约会来掩盖真相喽?
but dates women as a cover?

192
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,196
毕竟还是低调点好嘛
You know, on the down low?

193
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,065
什么? 低调?
What? The down low?

194
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:41,518
我男人可高调了... 他肯定是直男
My man is on the up high... he is straight.

195
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:42,986
我就知道你以为他是直男 罗基
I'm sure you think he is, Rocky,

196
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,739
但是我的基佬雷达可是很准的哦
but my gaydar is pretty impeccable.

197
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,630
怎么了 仙妮娅小姐?
Yes, miss Shania?

198
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,632
迭戈 我有话想对你说
Diego, I wanted to tell you.

199
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,051
尽管你们这类人想要在社会上向大家
Despite how difficult it must be in your community

200
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,503
公开自己的身份绝非易事
to proudly declare who you are,

201
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:00,587
但我已经知道了
I know.

202
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:01,671
你是指同志?
Homo?

203
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:03,640
我知道把手巾放在左口袋里
I know the hanky in your left pocket

204
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,091
就暗示着你是同志
is part of the gay hanky code.

205
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:08,895
这 我只是想在修剪杂草时 用它来擦擦汗
Well, I just, uh, use it to wipe my sweat when I trim the bushes.

206
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,046
好吧 我相信你
Okay, we'll go with that.

207
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,932
我把这个送给你吧
Here, I got you this.

208
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:13,817
这是布莱恩买的转录版的悲惨世界 
It's Bryan's screener for Les Miz.

209
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,437
可能你认识的人里有喜欢看这个的吧
Maybe you know someone who'd enjoy watching it.

210
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:23,577
我能察觉到任何的蛛丝马迹
I just know on, like, a molecular level.

211
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,862
抱歉 罗基 但克里斯真的是基佬
Sorry, Rocky, but Chris is gay.

212
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:30,033
简 你干嘛要带个头巾? 装暴发户?
Ooh, Jane, what's with the scarf? Chemo?

213
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,751
我可没谢顶哦
My hair is not thinning,

214
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,203
如果你是在暗示这个的话
if that's what you're implying.

215
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:35,755
罗基怎么满头大汗的?
Why is Rocky sweating?

216
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,041
哦 仙妮娅觉得罗基的男朋友
Oh, well, Shania accused Rocky's boyfriend

217
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:39,876
是个基佬... 事实并不是这样
of being gay... Which he is not.

218
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,179
所以我们在这里 把事情都说清楚
And we were just, uh, clearing up the situation.

219
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,247
我现在也正处于同样的境地
I am going through this exact same thing

220
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:45,515
他是我的一个同事
with this fellow at work.

221
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,083
现如今 要断定一个人是基佬
Well, it's not as easy to tell who's gay

222
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,518
还是直男已经没那么容易了
and who's straight anymore.

223
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:49,150
如果连我都有点晕
If I'm confused,

224
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:50,270
就更不敢想象你们直人的感受了
I can't imagine how you straights feel.

225
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,471
反正克里斯是直男
Well, Chris is straight.

226
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:52,772
但是你的那个直男
Well, your not-gay,

227
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:53,807
基佬男友绝对不可能
gay boyfriend can't be

228
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:55,025
比布赖斯更基情
any gayer than gay Brice.

229
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,309
你怎么突然关心起这个了?
Why do you even care?

230
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,311
我得确定我到底是该喜欢他还是讨厌他
I need to find out if I should like him or hate him.

231
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:00,197
然后矫正一下他的三观
And make him deal with his life choices

232
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,698
以免伤及无辜的女人
so he doesn't hurt innocent women.

233
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:02,782
比如我
Like me.

234
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,317
对了 要不我们一起吃顿饭
Ooh, what if we have a dinner,

235
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:05,952
这样我们就可以对这些男的
and then we can put these guys

236
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,871
进行基佬测试... 就像游戏竞赛节目那样
to a gay test... like a game show.

237
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,406
- 呜呼! - 我同意 
- Whoo-hoo! - Well, I'm in.

238
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,624
因为我确信我赢定了
Because I know I'm gonna win.

239
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:13,326
我也加入 为了弄清真相 让我做什么都行
Okay, I'll do anything to find out the truth.

240
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,078
如果这个点子奏效的话 我就把它
If this works, I can repackage it

241
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:16,546
和那些老古董一起打包卖给福克斯电视台
with has-beens and then sell it to FOX.

242
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:17,614
海滩别墅 我来啦!
Beach house!

243
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:24,116
我找到了最适合
I found the perfect

244
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:27,284
我们孩子在拍出生照时穿的衣服了!
outfit for the birth announcement picture.

245
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,121
不错吧? 我本来还打算
Huh? I was gonna get

246
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:32,406
买个小型护口器呢 但后来我发现
a little mouth guard, but then I realized

247
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,241
他还没长牙齿 所以用不着护口器 那么
he's not gonna have any teeth to protect, so...

248
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,443
这好歹比那个裙子好看啊
Well, it beats the dress.

249
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:38,712
那不叫裙子 叫晚礼服
It's not a dress, it's a gown.

250
00:08:38,747 --> 00:08:39,946
这两者是不一样的
And there's a difference.

251
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:42,176
可不嘛 一个是女孩穿的 一个是基佬穿的
Yeah, one is for girls, the other's for gays.

252
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:43,202
天啊
Wow.

253
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,364
我只是想过我想要的生活
I'm just trying to live my life.

254
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,358
我才发现原来和我
I didn't realize I was

255
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,392
住在一起的人竟然恐同啊
living it with a homophobe.

256
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,994
小布 我不是那个意思
That's not what I meant, Bry.

257
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,912
我只是觉得 让人们来参加一个
I'm just saying, it's gonna be weird enough

258
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,197
有两个爸爸的孩子的弄璋之喜
for some people to receive a birth announcement

259
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,365
就已经够奇怪的了
with two dads on it.

260
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,866
天啊 大卫
Oh, my God, David.

261
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,451
如果你真的担心
If you're so concerned

262
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,086
其他人有什么想法的话
about what other people might think,

263
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,704
那我就在礼服背后写上
I'll just write on the back of it,

264
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,906
"这是件晚礼服 并且他不是基佬"
"it's just a gown. He's not gay."

265
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,175
至少那时还不是
At least, not yet.

266
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,909
"不过到了青春期就不好说了"
"We'll check back at puberty."

267
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:06,045
你能不拿这个开玩笑吗?
Please, don't even joke about that.

268
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,746
那些对我们评头论足的人
All the people who judge us

269
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:09,932
到时肯定会站出来说 "瞧见没有?"
will get on their soapboxes and say, "see?"

270
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,384
"因为孩子周围有太多的基情因素
"He was surrounded by so much gay,

271
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,585
所以孩子本身也受到了影响"
it probably rubbed off on him."

272
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:13,853
那我父母的直人因素围绕我
Just like my parents surrounded me

273
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,855
这么多年了 怎么我还是成了基佬?
with all their straightness, and it rubbed off on me?

274
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,690
事物根本就不是那样发展的 大卫
It doesn't work that way, David.

275
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,559
我知道 但你也知道这是个现实的世界
Yeah, but you know how the world is.

276
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:20,693
人们就是喜欢谴责
People like to condemn

277
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,395
那些他们无法理解的事物
the things they don't understand.

278
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,447
之前有个... 
There was this...

279
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:28,951
...男孩 他是我们初中模联的队员
...kid on my junior high mock U.N. team.

280
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,120
我叫他死基佬
I called him a fag,

281
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,905
因为我很害怕
'cause I was afraid

282
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,207
人们有一天也会那样叫我
that people would call me that.

283
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,309
虽然那时还小
'Cause even back then,

284
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,910
但我很清楚我就是同志
I knew that I was one.

285
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,463
我希望...
I hope...

286
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,382
我们的儿子不要再经历
Our son won't experience the same

287
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:47,354
我们经历过的痛苦 羞辱和孤立 
pain and humiliation and exclusion that we did.

288
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,503
大卫
David,

289
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:49,982
我并不担心这些
I'm not concerned about that,

290
00:09:49,982 --> 00:09:51,149
因为我坚信
because I do believe

291
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,201
父母是会影响孩子的
that a kid's parents rub off on them.

292
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:55,453
但是我们教会他们的应该是
But the things that are gonna rub off on our kids

293
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:57,038
像坚强
are things like strength

294
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:59,273
容忍和爱心这样的品质
and tolerance and love.

295
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:04,612
我们晚点再讨论这个事吧?
Can we talk more about this later?

296
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,214
好的
Sure.

297
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:13,185
大家晚上好 欢迎来到... 
Good evening, and welcome to...

298
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:15,790
"是基是直?!"节目现场
"Gay or not gay?!"

299
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:19,460
呃 你们确定要搞这个?
Yeah, are you guys sure this is a good idea?

300
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:21,129
- 确定 一定 - 以及肯定
- Yes. Yes. - Yeah.

301
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:31,973
简
Jane.

302
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:33,942
哦 天啊
Oh, my lord,

303
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:35,076
你看起来
you look

304
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,111
美极了
amazing.

305
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:40,648
我很少用很"赞"
I do not use the word "fabulous"

306
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,916
这个形容词...
very often...

307
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,334
好吧 也不是很少啦
Okay, maybe I do.

308
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:45,670
但这一次用它绝对是史上最合适的
But I've never meant it more than I do right now.

309
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:47,455
真的? 穿着这个
Really? I feel

310
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:49,591
我觉得好没女人味
so unladylike in these clothes.

311
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,259
回去换也来不及了 是吧?
It's too late to go home and change, right?

312
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,011
男士们快到了吧 好吧
Boys are coming soon. Okay.

313
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:56,764
这个基佬测试是怎么做的?
How does the gay test work?

314
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,833
我们设计了一系列的测试
Okay, we've devised a series of tests

315
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:00,501
来判断你们的男人是直是弯
to see which way your men sway.

316
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,687
我们准备最先抛出的话题是...
The first topic we're gonna throw at them is...

317
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:04,505
女性奥斯卡奖获得者
Female Oscar winners.

318
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:05,773
真相就要大白了
Dead giveaway.

319

您请
Here you go.

320

您真绅士啊
That's very gentlemanly of you.

321
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:11,112
如果你知道我在惦记着你这身打扮
If you knew what I was thinking about your new look,

322
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:12,397
你就不会说我绅士了
you wouldn't call me a gentleman.

323
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:14,849
你这样实在太性感了 简
You look hot as hell, Jane.

324
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,901
对我来说这就有点异性恋的意味了
Now that seemed like genuine boy-girl stuff to me.

325
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:18,286
你的观察雷达怎么样了?
What's your man-tenna picking up?

326
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,565
再给我点时间
I need more time.

327
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:24,885

明天再开始节食吧
Diet starts tomorrow.

331
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:36,671
哔 哔 哔 哔 
Beep-beep-beep-beep.

332
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:38,223
你不是过敏吗?
Aren't you allergic?

333
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:39,051
说到过敏
Speaking of allergies,

334
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:40,808
我一看到迪亚波罗・科蒂在2008年
I about busted out in hives when I saw

335
00:11:40,843 --> 00:11:43,044
奥斯卡奖上穿的衣服 都要出麻疹了
what diablo Cody was wearing to the 2008 oscars.

有人记得吗?
Anybody remember?

337
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:45,212
噢 我的天
Oh, my God,

338
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:46,731
那条及地豹纹长裙?
that floor-length cheetah-print frock?

339
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:49,216
她看着像个带纹身的廉价沙发
She looked like a thrift store sofa with tattoos.

340
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:51,319
嗯 欢迎来到丛林 亲爱的
Hmm. Welcome to the jungle, honey.

341
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:53,404
我有点搞不懂 不过他上钩了
Very confusing. He took the bait,

342
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:55,890
但他把话题抛给了枪与玫瑰
but then he threw in that reference to guns n' roses.

343
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:56,991
抛给了什么?
To what?

344
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:58,576
算了
Never mind.

345
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:00,912
吃沙拉的时候 我们进行第二轮测试
Over salad, we'll initiate round two of testing,

346
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:02,830
依据同性恋男人的天赋
based on gay men's innate ability

347
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:04,782
猜猜排名前十的歌曲
to identify any top ten song.

348
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,668
格尔蒂 我们需要你帮个忙

00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:17,845
布莱恩 能不能把收音机打开?

等等 妈 我带了竖笛哦
Wait, mom, I brought my recorder.

"钻石"
By Rihanna.

361
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:34,563
拜托 才两个音符 什么歌都有可能啊
Come on. It was two notes. It could be any song.

362
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:36,430
有可能 但这首不可能
It could, but it isn't.

363
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:38,265
他说对了
He's right.

364

名人汇? 什么来的?
Celebrity? What's that?

368
00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:53,915
名人汇是猜人名 就是从橘色鲍尔曲奇罐里
Celebrity is a guessing game, where you draw names out

369
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:55,466
抽一个名字 然后尽力

让你的队友猜出你手里的名字

00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:58,469
布莱恩和我会预先布局

372
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:00,888

那如果这些都测完了
Okay, so after all that,

396
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:46,167
结果还不能确定呢?
what if the data is inconclusive?

397
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:47,352
还有一个终极测试
There is one, final test.

测试结果百分百准确
It is absolutely 100% accurate.

但如果他不是同性恋的话
But it is so horrible

400
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:52,774
让他经受这些也是很痛苦的
to make a man sit through if he's not gay.

401
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:56,027
我只会把它当成终极武器
I will only break this out as an absolute last resort.

We don't know that for sure, Jane.

- 戴拉・里斯小姐 - 嗯!

为什么不直接问他呢 罗基?
Why don't you just ask him, Rocky?

422
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:41,606
是啊 那不是比玩这些傻东西强多了?
Yeah, isn't it more honest than playing this silly game?

423
00:14:41,657 --> 00:14:43,608
不行 我问不出口
I can't. It's too hard.

424
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:45,576

但你居然办这个派对
but this little dinner party you're throwing

436
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,554
企图看看我是不是基佬?
to find out if I'm gay?

437
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:14,922
实在是可悲
That's pathetic.

438
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:24,782
哦 受不了了! 克里斯 你到底是直是弯?
Aw, hell! Chris, are you gay or straight?

439
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:26,451
我是什么?
Am I what?

440
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:28,069
你是基佬还是直男?
Are you gay or straight?

441
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:29,654
因为我们的游戏没什么用
Because this game we're playing

442
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:32,439
如果我们要在一起的话
isn't working and if we're gonna be a thing,

443
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,108
我必须弄清楚 现在!
then I need to know. Now!

444
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:39,914
好吧 我才不屑回答你的问题 罗基
Well, I don't think I care to answer that question, Rocky

445
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:41,466
但我要告诉你 你和我
I will tell you this though: You and I

446
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,967
绝对不是那么回事
are most definitely not a thing.

447
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:44,836
再没不是了
Not anymore. 

448
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:52,900
格尔蒂 我很抱歉昨晚把仙妮娅
Goldie, I'm so sorry I involved Shania

449
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,636
牵扯进那个基佬雷达晚餐
in that gaydar dinner last night.

450
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,218
我们不仅伤害了别人的感情
We hurt people's feelings

451
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:57,770
还给人留下了丑恶的印象
and we perpetuated ugly stereotypes.

452
00:15:57,804 --> 00:15:59,104
作为道歉 请接受
As an apology, please accept

453
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:00,939
这些法国拉杜丽薰衣草蛋白杏仁饼干
these French lavender macaroons from Laduree.

454
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:05,778
不 不 不 太漂亮了 吃了可惜
Neh, neh, neh, they're too beautiful to eat.

455
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:07,312
我好愧疚
I'm so ashamed.

456
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:08,781
我搞砸了罗基和克里斯的关系
I messed up Rocky's relationship with Chris,

457
00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:10,983
而且我可能真看错他了
and I might have been wrong about him.

458
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:13,652
可能我不是真的拥有什么神奇的基佬雷达
Maybe I never really had an amazing gaydar power at all.

459
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:16,038
我要在博客上写封道歉信
I'm going to write a letter of apology on my blog

460
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:17,289
给波特兰市
to the city of Portland

461
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:20,459
因为我说那里所有女的都是同性恋
for describing its entire female population as lesbian.

462
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:22,878
真感人 宝贝
That's very sweet, baby.

463
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:24,463
现在的人都是性向成迷
It's a whole new sexually ambiguous world

464
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:25,714
那样很好
out there, and that's good.

465
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:28,300
我是说 没人能百分百确定我是基佬
I mean, no one can be 100% sure that I'm gay.

466
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:32,805
- 当然 - 是啊
- Sure. - Yes.

467
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,473
但是我...
But I...

468
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:35,757
- 我能不能...? - 别想...
- Can I...? - Don't even...

469
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:37,059
抱歉
I'm sorry.

470
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:40,529
好了 上午的工作就到这里 各位
All right, that's a wrap, folks.

471
00:16:40,563 --> 00:16:41,914
一小时午餐时间
Take an hour for lunch.

472
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:46,885
克里斯 我做错了
Chris, what I did was wrong.

473
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,521
我不应该隐瞒你真正的晚餐意图
I shouldn't have lied to you about the auspices of our dinner.

474
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:51,690
我真的很抱歉
I am truly sorry.

475
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:55,360
我没资格指责你撒谎
I've got no right to criticize you for lying.

476
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,529
罗基 我是同性恋
Rocky, I am gay.

477
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,698
我没有经常公开提及
I don't say that aloud too often,

478
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,834
因为你看看和我一起工作的人
'cause look at this crew I work with.

479
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:03,085
这儿简直就像公鸭王朝
It's like duck dynasty up in here.

480
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:07,405
而且我们相处很愉快 所以我没告诉你
And I didn't tell you 'cause we were too busy having fun.

481
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:10,909
但是当我发觉你对我有那种意思时
But when I realized that you had those kind of feelings for me,

482
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,428
我不知道怎么告诉你真相又不会伤害你
I didn't know how to tell the truth without hurting you.

483
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:17,466
好吧 现在我知道真相了 我仍然需要你
Well, now that I know the truth, I still want you in my life,

484
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:19,751
只是不作为男朋友
but just not as a boyfriend.

485
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:23,421
我还能叫你"女朋友"吗?
Can I still call you "girlfriend"?

486
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,357
噢 我强调一下 告诉你一件事
Oh, I insist. And let me tell you something:

487
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,776
我是"歌唱吧!"的制作人 那意味着
I am a producer of Sing! And that means

488
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,611
我在这儿有说话权
I contribute to the order up in here.

489
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:32,231
如果有任何人因为你的性向
And if any person makes you feel uncomfortable

490
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:34,099
让你不痛快
because of who you are,

491
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:37,069
你马上来告诉我 我会秉公处理
you run and tattle to me and I will bring the justice.

492
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,537
好的
Okay.

493
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:40,272
在明天玛莉・布莱姬的演唱会之前...
And also before the Mary J. Blige concert tomorrow...

494
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,907
嘻哈女神?
Manis and pedis?

495
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:43,408
姐妹儿 冷静点
Girl, calm down.

496
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:44,793
我们要共进晚餐
We're doing dinner.

497
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:45,827
我很荣幸
I'd love that.

498
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:46,945
很好 明天见
Good. See you tomorrow.

499
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:52,284
美女 你的美臀还是那么性感
Girl, that ass is still banging.

500
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,894
我听说你你在格兰特上卖出了那套房子
I heard you sold that house on Glendower.

501
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:04,213
恭喜你
Congratulations.

502
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:07,282
谢谢
Thank you.

503
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,067
还有什么事吗?
Anything else?

504
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:10,602
没了
No.

505
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:15,157
- 其实 有 - 噢 是吗?
- Actually, yes. - Oh, yeah?

506
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:17,642
需要我告诉你米科诺斯岛上最好的酒吧吗?
Would you like some tips on the best bar in Mykonos?

507
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,828
或者我们可以玩女神嘎嘎冷知识
Or maybe we could play some Lady Gaga trivia.

508
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:22,197
或者也许你想知道
Or perhaps you're looking for some tips on how to remove

509
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,166
怎么洗掉窄脚牛仔裤上的酒渍?
Merlot stains out of skinny jeans?

510
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,818
我想和你谈谈昨晚的事情
I wanted to say something to you about last night.

511
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:30,005
我想和你道歉
I wanted to say I was sorry

512
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,924
我做的事很不光彩
and that what I did was not kind.

513
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,125
那你为什么还要做?
Then why did you do it?

514
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,994
我想要知道你是基佬还是直男
I needed to know if you were gay or straight.

515
00:18:36,012 --> 00:18:38,297
噢 老天 你那么快就开始评判每个人
Oh, my God, you are so quick to judge everyone.

516
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:40,465
你想要给每个人贴上某些老套的标签
You want to label everyone up against some old stereotype.

517
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:43,352
你是我这辈子见过最刻板的人
You are the most stereotypical person I've ever met in my life.

518
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:44,486
你为什么在意别人是什么样?
What do you care what anyone is?

519
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:45,503
为什么在意我是什么样?
Why do you care what I am?

520
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:47,672
因为我喜欢你 因为我...
Because I like you. Because I'm d...

521
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,858
我迷上你了
I'm drawn to you.

522
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:54,512
我很爱我丈夫埃德加
I really loved my husband, Edgar.

523
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,198
真的
I really did.

524
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:57,849
我们在一起度过了最美好的时光
We had the best time together.

525
00:18:57,867 --> 00:18:59,985
我们会一起去电影院
We would go to the theater,

526
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:02,621
一起发现新的小酒馆
we would discover new bistros.

527
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:04,990
我深陷其中
I was so attracted to all that.

528
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:10,528
但埃德加却没有...为我痴迷
But Edgar was not attracted... To me.

529
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:15,367
我不想再犯一次同样的错误
And I do not want to make that same mistake twice.

530
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:17,970
简 世界变了
Jane, the world has changed.

531
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:19,838
世界不是非黑即白
It's not black and white anymore.

532
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:22,224
对我来说 世界变得太多了
Well, maybe it's just too much change for me.

533
00:19:25,762 --> 00:19:26,878
坐下吧
Sit down.

534
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:30,715
我可以帮你改变发型
I can help you change your hair,

535
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,018
我可以帮你改变穿着
I can help you change your outfit,

536
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:34,486
但只有你能改变你自己
but only you can change yourself.

537
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,054
你得问问你自己
The question you have to ask is

538
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:39,074
你是想继续坚持过去的一切是是非非呢
do you want to hold onto the way things used to be and be right,

539
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:41,727
还是想改变 变得幸福?
or do you want to change and be happy?

540
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,586
还觉得我是基佬么?
You still think I'm gay?

541
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,376
老娘不在乎了
I don't care.

542
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,696
那么 我一直在想我们孩子
So, I have been thinking about the outfit

543
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,748
在弄璋之喜上穿的衣服
our baby will wear for the birth announcement.

544
00:20:05,782 --> 00:20:08,584
噢 亲爱的 我真不觉得这事有多重要
Oh, sweetie, I really don't want this to be a whole thing.

545
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:11,069
所以你想让他穿什么就穿什么
So he can wear whatever you want him to wear.

546
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:17,376
你怎么改主意了?
What made you change your mind?

547
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,627
那个愚蠢的晚餐聚会
That silly dinner party.

548
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:22,014
昨晚 我又变成了那个初中小屁孩
Last night, I became that kid from junior high all over again.

549
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:24,717
评判着别人 因为怕自己被评判
Judging someone because I was afraid of being judged.

550
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:26,351
不只是你
It wasn't just you.

551
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:27,753
还有仙妮娅
It was Shania, too.

552
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:32,057
如果我们不改变 不进化 我们就会死
If we don't change, if we don't evolve, then we die.

553
00:20:32,091 --> 00:20:34,727
你现在没看见兽脚类恐龙在外边乱晃了
You don't see any theropod dinosaurs hanging around

554
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:36,101
不是吗? 你知道为什么吗?
anymore, do you? You want to know why?

555
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,458
因为驰龙科...
Because dromaeosauridae...

556
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,240
噢 老天 大卫
Oh, my God, David, it's like you want me

557
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,434
你想分散我的注意力吗
to stop paying attention.

558
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,788
我不想要我们的儿子
I just don't want our son

559
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,923
有和我一样的成长经历
to grow up the way that I did:

560
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:49,575
害怕做自己
Afraid to be myself,

561
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:52,277
循规蹈矩 以防被人评判
playing into stereotypes so he won't be judged.

562
00:20:52,295 --> 00:20:55,881
但只要我不害怕 他就可以那样做
But he can only do that if I'm not afraid.

563
00:20:55,915 --> 00:20:58,016
所以 来吧
So, go ahead.

564
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:01,887
让我们的儿子穿上裙... 礼服
Put our son in the dress... gown.

565
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:04,790
但我做了个小小的改动
But I do have one slight adjustment.

566
00:21:11,598 --> 00:21:12,964
太完美了
It's perfect.

567
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:17,078
既古怪又惊艳 会让大家凌乱的
It's odd and amazing, and it will confuse everyone.

568
00:21:17,953 --> 00:21:19,208
不过我喜欢
And I love it.
