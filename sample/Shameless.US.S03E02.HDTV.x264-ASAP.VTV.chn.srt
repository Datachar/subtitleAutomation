1
00:00:00,718 --> 00:00:03,586
下面就是你们上周错过的内容
This is what you missed last week on <i>Shameless.</i>

2
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:07,057
全是关于哥的 非常的酷炫
It was great. It was all about me.

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:09,693
差不多就是一趟英雄的旅程
Sort of the hero's journey.

4
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:12,629
-我在哪  - 华瑞兹（墨西哥城市）
- Where am I? - Juarez.

5
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:13,730
我错过圣诞了么
Did I miss Christmas?

6
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,432
你都快错过复活节了
You almost missed Easter.

7
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:18,435
- 早上好 Debs  -都137天了 爸爸还没回来
- Morning, Debs. - 137 days.

8
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,870
他会回来的 Debs 他总是会回来的
He'll be back, Debs. He always comes back.

9
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:28,878
- 你好啊 Steve -嘿 Nando
- Well, hello, Steve. - Nando.

10
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:30,947
我没想过会在这能看到你
You know, I was surprised to see you in the States

11
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:33,717
我以为你会在缉毒局的监视名单上
'cause I-I thought that the DEA had you on a watch list.

12
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:36,219
我确实在
They do.

13
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,121
所以你能想到 我有多高兴能过来吧
So you can imagine how happy I am to come here.

14
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:40,690
我已经给Estefania买了一张芝加哥大学经济学证书
I've arranged for Estefania to pursue an economics degree.

15
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:43,360
我想让她成为一个美国公民 Steve
I want her to be an American citizen, Steve.

16
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:45,962
所以 当移民局过来调查时 你就是她的合法丈夫
When Immigration comes, you will be her husband.

17
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:48,198
这也就意味着 你不能再惹麻烦了
But that means you can't get into any trouble.

18
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:49,966
那我怎么活啊
How am I supposed to make a living?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,034
找个工作
Get a job.

20
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:52,602
我今天把工作丢了
Lost my job today.

21
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,738
我们付产权税的钱够么
We gonna have enough for the property tax bill?

22
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:56,973
只要加上我今天领的支票就行了
Just, with the check I got today.

23
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:58,408
Lip和Ian早走了
Lip and Ian left early?

24
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:00,410
他们说上学之前他们要去市中心
They said they had to pick something up

25
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:01,611
去取个什么东西
downtown before school.

26
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,546
- 去市中心 -他们就是这么说的
- Downtown? - What they said.

27
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:05,548
我希望你给我机会尝试做一下助理经理
I was hoping you'd give me a shot at assistant managing,

28
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,384
就像我们去年秋天商量好的那样
like we discussed last fall.

29
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:10,420
给我1000块 我就给你安排一晚上试试
Give me 1,000 bucks, I'll find you a night to promote.

30
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:12,555
1000块 全在这儿了
$1,000. It's all there.

31
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,658
那好吧 你来试试吧
Okay. You're on the calendar.

32
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:17,660
-天哪 -嘿 你能把那个递给我
- Oh, my God. - Hey, can you pass me that--

33
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:23,033
- 老爸
- Daddy!

00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:48,618
怎么了
What's the matter?

53
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:50,120
那可是1000块钱啊
$1,000.

54
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:53,390
-快继续睡吧 -我都不能呼吸了
- Mm, back to sleep. - I can't breathe.

55
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:54,691
可能是因为你把枕头摁在脸上吧
Maybe it has something to do with the pillow on your face.

56
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:56,526
我要去付产权税
I gotta pay the property tax.

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,128
好吧好吧 快点过来
All right, come here,come here, come here.

58
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:03,733
别用那玩艺戳我
Stop poking me with that thing.

59
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:04,968
我以为你喜欢我用这玩艺戳你呢
Thought you liked me poking you with this thing.

60
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:06,469
我当时是怎么了
What was I thinking?

61
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:18,948
你是因为那个夜店的事不爽么
Is this about the club thing?

62
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:21,918
我做了个噩梦
I woke up having a panic attack

63
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,255
我感觉我就像是Frank和 Monica那样 顺走我们的钱
that I was just like Frank and Monica taking our money,

64
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,123
唯一的区别是 我甚至都没让自己嗨一下
except I wasn't even getting high with it.

65
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:28,458
你一定会举办一个酷炫的夜店之夜的
You know, you're gonna throw a kick-ass club night.

66
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:31,261
你想成为一个不一样的人吧
You gotta be entrepreneurial, right?

67
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,096
那你就要投资你自己
Invest in yourself.

68
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,636
你现在是在大便吗
Are you taking a dump right now?

69
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,305
- 每天早上 准的像闹钟一样 - 我的天
- Like clockwork, every morning. - Jesus.

70
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:43,973
干嘛 我都不能在这大便吗
What, I can't take a dump in here?

71
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:45,308
不能当着我的面拉啊
Not in front of me you can't.

72
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:46,709
但是你在浴室里啊
You were in the shower.

73
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:48,411
对啊 但我现在出来了
Yeah, and now I'm out of the shower.

74
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:50,480
你要是在我面前拉大便我不会介意啊
I wouldn't care if you took a dump in front of me.

75
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,048
唉
Ugh.

76
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:54,083
草 怎么回事
Oh! What's going on?

77
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:55,785
Frank醉了 在找床
Frank drunk looking for a bed.

78
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,053
谁他妈的让他来找床的
Who the hell let him?

79
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:59,122
-是Debbie -我们都求过她别这样了
- Debbie! - We begged her not to.

80
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,890
-我不会让他睡我的床的
- He's not hot-bunking my bed.

81
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:03,393
他干嘛不能就睡在外面沙发上 那里够暖和了
Why can't he sleep out on the porch? It's warm enough.

82
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:06,095
我要睡回我原来的床
I want my old bed back.

83
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,764
该死 不行
Oh, hell, no!

84
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:11,000
过来吧 爸爸 上来
Come on, daddy. Up.

85
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,970
小心台阶
Step, step.

86
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:14,971
早上好 Frank
Morning, Frank.

87
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,906
这可是我的房子
This is my house!

88
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:18,775
没关系的 爸爸 你可以睡在我的房间里
It's okay, daddy. You can sleep in my room.

89
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,176
不行啊 Debs
Wouldn't do it, Debs.

90
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:22,245
他今早特别臭
He's especially ripe this morning.

91
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,580
Frank闻起来像狗尿一样
Frank smells like dog piss.

92
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:26,316
才不是狗尿
Not dog piss!

93
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,118
—流浪汉Gary才是  —过来吧老爸
- Gary the homeless guy. - Come on, daddy.

94
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:40,363
祝你好梦啊 爸爸
Sweet dreams, daddy.

95
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:41,931
嘿 那可是我的帐篷
Hey, that's my tent.

96
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,300
等他醒了我会帮你把它冲干净的
I'll hose it off after he wakes up.

97
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:46,636
Debs 别让Frank再进来了
Debs, don't let Frank in here anymore.

98
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,004
这也是他的家啊
This is his home too.

99
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,205
他可是消失了几个月
He disappeared for months.

100
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,877
但他现在回来了 借过
And now he's back. Excuse.

101
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:32,782
买牛奶的钱
Milk money.

102

你的早饭
Breakfast.

103

你拉屎之后洗干净了没
Did you wash up after you pooped?

104
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,920
你以为你是我妈吗
What are you, my mom now?

105
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:38,946
拉屎之后 我们应该要洗手的吗
We're supposed to wash up after we poop?

106
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:44,394
让你女朋友穿好衣服 Lip
Tell your girlfriend to wear clothes, Lip.

107
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,962
我又不是他爸妈
Not her keeper.

108
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:49,065
你不想看就别看啊
Don't look if you don't like what you see.

109
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,868

快穿裤子 现在就穿
Pants. Now.

111
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,271

Oh, no. Later. Gotta skip my first three periods,

114
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:01,311
我得去做社工了
so I can start clocking community service hours.

115
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:05,148
补齐产权税的最后50块 哟
And the last 50 bucks to the property tax, yo.

116
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:09,452
钱这样差不多能够
This should bring us right around where we need to be.

117
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:16,326
我还没把我上次清理有毒废料挣来的钱
I didn't put in the money from that last

118
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,728

- toxic waste gig I had yet. - Okay, that's cool.

119
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:21,264
把那些钱拿过来 
Hand it over, and I'll drop it off

120
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,599
我去做社工的路上顺便去把税给交了
before I go to community service, pay the tax man.

121
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,067
不在我手上了
I don't have it.

122
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:26,235
-什么东西不在你手上了 -那些钱
- Don't have what? -The money.

123
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,739
我用那些钱去交夜店的包夜保证金了
I used it to put down a deposit on a club night.

124
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:31,507
行了
All right.

125
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:35,244
Debs Carl 我们走吧 该去上学了
Debs, Carl, let's go. School time.

126

我要先去给爸爸送早饭
Gotta bring daddy his breakfast first.

127
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:41,517
但是产权税已经拖了两个星期了啊
Uh, but the property tax, that's already two weeks late.

128
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:43,086
我们总要拖两个星期的
We're always two weeks late.

129
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,254
party之后我会把钱拿回来的
I'll have the money back right after the party.

130
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,356
那些钱又不是你能随便花的
It wasn't yours to spend.

131
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,124
我能啊 都是我挣的
Yeah, it was. I earned it.

132
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,792
噢 原来我们现在都能这么干了啊
Oh. Oh, that's how we're doing this now.

133
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,361
那行啊 我要把我上周挣的钱拿出来
Okay, well, I'll take the money I made last week

134
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,996
去买个Ipad
and buy an iPad.

135
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,697
Ian 你支票上的钱准备怎么花
Ian, what are you gonna do with your paycheck, huh?

136
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:56,666
去买个新的皮夹克 Liam呢
New leather jacket? Liam?

137
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,768
我现在有个机会能好好挣些钱 Lip
I have an opportunity to make some real money here, Lip.

138
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:00,336
这个机会很难得的

339
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:29,738
进去之前买了一堆可卡因

自己带酒赚的更多
She'll make more money if she brings her own.

355
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:06,175
行吧 瘸过来

361
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:24,226
那你批发商呢

他能让我赊账吗
Would he let me set up an account and invoice me later?

我信用贼好
I've got perfect credit.

375
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,186
没有信用记录不等于就是好

376
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:54,256
你有社保号吗
Do you even have a social security number?

377

听起来就跟

687
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:24,132
你靠后门从墨西哥溜回来一样

719
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:52,887
希望能
Hope so.

720
00:32:52,922 --> 00:32:54,255
我觉得你可以的
I bet you will

721
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,491
看起来你有些天赋的
Looks like you have some real talent.

722
00:32:56,525 --> 00:32:59,961
你好像不是在说我搞定俱乐部的才能吧
You're not talking about my club promoting skills, are you?

723
00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:01,930
为啥这么说
What makes you say that?

724
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:03,264
你的手放在我膝盖上
Your hand on my knee.

725
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,133
我还打算伸进你裙子里呢
I meant to put it up your skirt.

727
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:08,269
你觉得我拿到
What are the chances of me

728
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:10,071
你的联系名单的可能性大吗
getting ahold of your email lists?

729
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:12,340
我凭什么给你
Why would I give them to you?

687
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:15,176
额 帮助一个好人的满足感
Mm, satisfaction of knowing you're helping a good person.

688
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:19,280
不 我不会满足的
No, I can't come inside that.

689
00:33:19,315 --> 00:33:21,416
我会分你好处的
I could give you a cut of my bar, then.

690
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,017
10%
10%?

691
00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:25,653
你知道我花了多久才建好我的顾客名单的
You know how long it took me to build up my list?

692
00:33:25,688 --> 00:33:27,589
你天真地认为我会冒险为了你的烂场子
You honestly think I'd risk it on you throwing some lame party

693
00:33:27,623 --> 00:33:30,425
搞臭我的牌子而只因为少于50%的好处吗
and ruining my brand for anything less than 50%?

694
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:33,194
这是个有趣的建议
Well, that's an interesting offer.

695
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:36,531
等我和我姐妹商量下
Let me discuss it with my partner.

739
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:39,434
♪ Come, come, baby, yeah,
come, come, baby, yeah ♪

740
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:42,337
他说他的联系人名单值一半
He wants 50% of the bar for his email list,

697
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:44,272
这个傻逼
and he's a giant douche bag.

698
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:45,573
不用担心
No worries.

699
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,008
我从他的夹克里顺来了他的电话
I swiped his phone from his jacket

700
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:49,077
趁他的的手在你腿上的时候
as soon as I saw his hand on your knee.

701
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,945
可以搞定所有的联系人了
Has all his contacts.

702
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,847

你怎么做到的 Debbie
How did you do it, Debbie?

707
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,108
我爸对孩子有一套
Daddy's good with babies.

709
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:42,264
你这是刚回来
You just getting home?

710
00:34:43,098 --> 00:34:45,300

Oh, hey. Still awake?

你让Carl在上学的日子熬夜
You let Carl stay up late on a school night.

715
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:04,286
我觉得你该打屁屁了
I think you need a spanking.

716
00:35:06,422 --> 00:35:10,158
但是你穿着裤子我没法动手
I can't do it with your pants on, though.

717
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:14,896
那我就该脱了对吧
Then I should take them off.

718
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,667

After everything I have done for you,

866
00:39:49,505 --> 00:39:51,273
这就是我得到的谢谢吗
this is the thanks I get.

867
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:53,175
-我们把他扔哪  -该去哪去哪
- Where should we put him? - Where he belongs.

868
00:39:53,209 --> 00:39:55,510
-打开 Carl  -好的
- Open it up, Carl! - Got it.

869
00:39:55,545 --> 00:39:56,611
无论你们
Whatever, you--

870
00:39:56,646 --> 00:40:00,682
老天爷
Jesus Christ!

871
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:04,152
这不好玩 真的不好玩
Not funny! Not funny at all!

872
00:40:04,187 --> 00:40:06,621
需要你们清理飞溅在墙上的血水
Gonna need you to clean the blood splatter on the walls,

873
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,391
地板上证据标记 然后修补弹孔
evidence marks on the floor, and patch up the bullet holes.

874
00:40:09,425 --> 00:40:10,625
你们先从这些入手
That should get you started.

875
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,195
-工具在里面  -我擦
- Supplies are inside. - Shit.

876
00:40:13,229 --> 00:40:14,629
咋啦 哥们
You okay, buddy?

877
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:16,164
花了一早上想弄一张
Been trying all morning to get tickets

878
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,866
今晚在Soldier广场的Wilco音乐会的票
to the Wilco concert at Soldier Field tonight.

879
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,734
- 结果没买上  -Wilco（乐队）
- Can't get through. - Wilco?

880
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:21,803
不就是那种头发梳到后发际线的大叔们
Aren't they for, like, dads with receding hairlines and shit?

881
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,373
算了吧 Wilco是那种反商业性质的
Come on, Wilco is the beacon of anti-commercialism.

882
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:26,641
好吧 因为没人愿意为那无聊的音乐花钱
Yeah, because no one wants to buy their whiny music,

883
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:27,809
所以他们才免费的
they gotta give it away for free.

884
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:29,477
我擦
Shit.

885
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:31,513
欧了 这是你的 除了之前50块
All right, here you go. It's 50 bucks a head.

886
00:40:31,547 --> 00:40:33,081
这是400块
That's $400.

888
00:40:34,884 --> 00:40:36,852
我有幸知道接下来几天的计划吗
is there any chance I can get an advance on the next couple days?

889
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:38,220
不要急 孩子
Hey, slow your roll, kid.

890
00:40:38,254 --> 00:40:39,254
我还没看到他们能不能干
I haven't seen what they could do yet.

891
00:40:39,288 --> 00:40:40,255
-先生  - 恩
- Señor. - Yeah?

892
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:42,023
这就是抢我们饭碗的人
This man stole our jobs?

893
00:40:42,058 --> 00:40:46,161
不 我可没抢  只是我的价格更低
No, no, I didn't steal them, I just underbid you.

894
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:49,197
我们是非法移民 你怎么可能比我们还低
But we are illegal immigrants. How can you underbid us?

895
00:40:49,232 --> 00:40:50,599
白人苦力就是新的社会底层
Ghetto white's the new brown.

896
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:54,436
-啥  -新奴隶
- The what? - The new brown.

897
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,538
这不公平
This is unfair.

898
00:40:56,572 --> 00:40:59,708
还活在美国梦里呢 哥们儿
Just living the American dream, amigo!

899
00:40:59,742 --> 00:41:03,712
好 我们先放8箱啤酒在前面
Okay, let's keep eight cases of that beer up front,

900
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:05,013
剩下的放在后面的冰箱里
and put the rest in the back refrigerator.

901
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:06,081
你好
Hello.

902
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:07,415

People showing up already?

904
00:41:10,453 --> 00:41:12,020
- ? turn it up... ?
有什么需要帮忙的吗
- Can I help you?

905
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:15,090
Alderman Edward Gretsky,第十五任保卫
Alderman Edward Gretsky,
15th Ward.

906
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:16,458

Okay.

907
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:18,526

差不多
Something like that.

909
00:41:20,463 --> 00:41:22,697
就是个善意的探访
Just a friendly visit.

910
00:41:22,732 --> 00:41:24,032
确保你填好申请了
You know, make sure you filled
out all your applications.

Well, I'm sure Meg handled
everything that you need.

914
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:33,208
她确实是 但是是为她自己的生意
She did.
For her business.

915
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:34,743
什么
What?

916
00:41:34,777 --> 00:41:36,478
你现在管秀场，对吧
Well, you're running
the show now, right?

917
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,079
是，但就今晚
Well, just for tonight.

918
00:41:38,114 --> 00:41:39,748
那就今晚
Then just for tonight

919
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:42,484
我破个例，申请一个小额的申请费
I'll make an exception
on the applications for...

920
00:41:42,518 --> 00:41:44,219
small filing fee.

921
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:48,623
申请费
就1000刀吧
- A filing fee?
- Let's say $1,000.

922
00:41:48,658 --> 00:41:50,992
总不希望多事的警察和消防员
Wouldn't want
any pesky policemen or firemen

923
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:53,094
今晚出现吧，是吧
showing up now, would we?

924
00:41:55,197 --> 00:41:57,132
我迟点来收
I'll come back later
to collect.

925
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,901
早上2点吧
Let's say 2:00 AM.

926
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,741
小指头怎么样了
How is the pinky?

927
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:08,410
还行
It's doing okay.

928
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,512
听着，我女朋友今晚要开一个party
So listen, my girlfriend's
having a party tonight.

929
00:42:10,546 --> 00:42:11,947
我必须得露面
It's important that I go.

930
00:42:11,981 --> 00:42:14,115
那肯定得有酒吧
Is there going to be
alcohol there?

931
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,284
这是个party，那肯定得有啊
It's a party, it's kind of
how these things work, yeah.

932
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,019
大麻呢
可能有
- Drugs?
- Maybe.

933
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:21,289
可能会出事
也许会也许不会
- Bad things may happen.
- Yeah, or not.

934
00:42:21,324 --> 00:42:23,591
那我跟你一起去，以防万一
I go with you.
Just to make sure.

935
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,293
事情就是你不能跟我一起去
Yeah, see, that's the thing
is that you can't go with me

936
00:42:25,328 --> 00:42:26,761
因为你去我就得解释你是谁
because then I'll have
to explain who you are,

937
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:28,296
我怎么认识你的，我的生活现在很危险
how I know you,
that my life's in danger.

938
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:29,764
我的意思是这事肯定不会很顺
I mean, that won't
go over very well.

939
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:32,667
那你就老实呆在家
Then you stay home.

940
00:42:43,245 --> 00:42:44,646
Hey, Sanchez.

941
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,982
该还账了
- Aw, hell.
- Time to pay up.

942
00:42:47,016 --> 00:42:49,617
他们放你出来了
表现的好
- They let you out?
- Good behavior.

943
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:50,618
我还以为有4个月呢
I thought I had
four more months.

944
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,420
重新想想
Think again.

945
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:55,857
学校的巡警过来了
Hey, yo,
campus security is coming.

946
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:58,193
你干什么呢
The hell are you doing?

947
00:42:58,227 --> 00:43:00,428
不想你又被逮进去
Didn't want you to get busted.

948
00:43:00,463 --> 00:43:02,697
我可以自己照顾自己，谢谢
I can look after myself,
thank you.

949
00:43:02,732 --> 00:43:04,032
他和你在一起时，眼里有那种眼神吗
Does he get that look
in his eye-- look in his eye--

950
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:07,002
look in his eye
when he's with you?

951
00:43:07,036 --> 00:43:08,912
刚出少管所，记得吗
Just got outta juvie, remember?

952
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:13,808
你他妈看什么呢
没什么
- The fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.

953
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:24,052
你看上去真美
You look great.

954
00:43:24,086 --> 00:43:28,123
谢谢，Debs
Thanks, Debs.

955
00:43:28,157 --> 00:43:30,792
早上Frank的事，你还好吧
You okay with what happened
this morning? Frank?

956
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:36,164
jimmy在浴室呕吐呢
Jimmy's in the bathroom puking.

957
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:47,609
怎么了
What's going on?

958
00:43:47,643 --> 00:43:49,744
我吃坏肚子了
Something I ate.
It's not sitting well.

959
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:52,447
你需要什么吗
You need anything?

960
00:43:55,151 --> 00:43:57,652
我就肚子有点难受，今晚估计去不了
No, I'm just bummed
I can't make it tonight.

961
00:43:57,686 --> 00:44:00,488
我真的很想去的
I mean, I really wanted to go.

962
00:44:00,523 --> 00:44:03,024
如果你觉得迟点好受了，再去吧，好吗
If you feel better later,
come on over, okay?

963
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:05,060
好的
Okay.

964
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:13,768
走开，我们什么都不买
Go away. We're not buying.

965
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:18,473
老天啊
Jeez.

966
00:44:18,507 --> 00:44:20,108
我知道，你想让我找到上帝
I know, I know,
you want me to find Jesus.

967
00:44:20,142 --> 00:44:22,143
我已经找到上帝了，谢谢
I already found him, thanks.

968
00:44:22,178 --> 00:44:23,278
我要找Kev
I'm looking for Kev.

969
00:44:23,312 --> 00:44:24,979
Kevin Ball.

970
00:44:25,014 --> 00:44:28,650
我是他老婆
I'm his wife.

971
00:44:28,684 --> 00:44:32,020

? I ask myself why
but I don't know ?

972
00:44:32,054 --> 00:44:34,656
? fairy tales... ?

973
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:37,192
Tommy!

974
00:44:37,226 --> 00:44:40,161
你的车库还在吗
Hey, you still got that garage?

975
00:44:40,196 --> 00:44:41,796
是的，Frank，和我的房子是配套的
Yeah, it kinda
comes with the house, Frank.

976
00:44:41,831 --> 00:44:44,666
好的，你觉得让我睡你车库怎么样
Great. What's say
you let me sleep there?

977
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,067
做梦
What's say I don't.

978
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:48,670
为什么不行呢
因为上次
- Why the hell not?
- Because the last time

979
00:44:48,704 --> 00:44:50,972
你呆在我这，你在我厨房水槽尿尿
you stayed at my place,
you shit in my kitchen sink.

980
00:44:51,006 --> 00:44:55,810
那是因为你家的布局太让人困惑了
The layout of your home
is very confusing.

981
00:44:55,845 --> 00:44:57,212
不行，Frank
No, Frank.

982
00:44:57,246 --> 00:44:59,147
不行就是不行
No means no.

983
00:44:59,181 --> 00:45:01,583
操你，Tommy
Fuck you, Tommy.

984
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:04,185
操你就是操你
Fuck you means fuck you.

985
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,687
Kermit!

986
00:45:05,721 --> 00:45:08,022
我的好朋友
My best friend.

987
00:45:08,057 --> 00:45:09,724
你不能住我那，Frank
You can't stay with me, Frank.

988
00:45:09,758 --> 00:45:12,727
要是我给你口交呢
Wh-- what if
I suck your dick?

989
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:14,229
Frank.

990
00:45:14,263 --> 00:45:16,231
要不你移民去墨西哥吧，怎么样Frank
What if you immigrate
to Mexico, Frank?

991
00:45:16,265 --> 00:45:18,099
反转移民大潮
Reverse the prevailing tide.

992
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:19,701
你干嘛呆在这
Why are you even here?

993
00:45:19,735 --> 00:45:21,336
难道你不应该去领残疾证吗
Should be
collecting disability.

994
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,204
因为我不是在工作时把脚摔断的
'Cause I didn't
injure my foot at work.

995
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:25,673
要不让我住你家吧
Hey, let me crash
at your place.

996
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:28,276
我告诉保险公司你是自己弄伤的
I'll tell the insurance company
that you did.

997
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,845
为什么你不能呆在你自己的地方呢，Frank
Why can't you stay
at your place, Frank?

998
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,815
就是那帮不知道感恩的小混蛋
Ungrateful little shits! That's why.

999
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:36,351
我为他们做了那么多
Things I do for them.

1000
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:38,586
流血，流汗，还有流泪
Blood, sweat, and tears.

1001
00:45:38,621 --> 00:45:41,489
问明是一家人 他们不应该这么对我
This is not how a family
treats each other.

1002
00:45:41,524 --> 00:45:42,891

够交房产税吗？

我没地方可去
Where am I supposed to go?

1010
00:49:38,093 --> 00:49:39,894
摇摇他
Just-- just shake him.

1011
00:49:39,928 --> 00:49:41,562
你不应该摇婴儿
You're not supposed to shake a baby.

1012
00:49:41,597 --> 00:49:44,031
我知道 我只想让他别再哭了
I know, but maybe it'll make him stop crying.

1013
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:46,334
当然 他脑子摇坏了当让就不哭了
Yeah, because his brains will get scrambled.

1014
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:48,035
他的脑子可以已经坏掉了。
- They already are!

1015
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,404
摇一摇可能把
I'm just saying maybe it'll

You need help with that baby?

1019

只是别让他吸我的奶奶就成
I don't mean your wet nurse,
that involves breast-feeding,

1025
00:50:07,456 --> 00:50:10,057
我可以做你的保姆 你孩子的保姆
but your nurse, your baby nurse.

1026
00:50:10,092 --> 00:50:11,926
只要给我提供食宿 你就会有八小时的睡眠
Room and board, you'll get eight hours of sleep a night.

1027
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,761

1028
00:50:13,796 --> 00:50:15,363
Debbie是说他很擅长照顾婴儿

那祝贺你了

1152

1154
00:53:17,913 --> 00:53:19,580
这不是重点
That's not the point.

1155
00:53:19,615 --> 00:53:21,916
你问也不问我们 就自己做决定

对不起 我第一次听说
No, I'm sorry, that's-- that's news to me.

1158
00:53:26,622 --> 00:53:30,558
你看着的 Fiona 如果我们每个人都只想自己
You see, Fiona, if we're gonna be every man for himself,

1159
00:53:30,592 --> 00:53:32,893
那这个家很快就完蛋了
this family is going under fast.

1160
00:53:32,928 --> 00:53:35,429
把钱拿着 好吧
Here, just take the money, okay?

1161
00:53:35,464 --> 00:53:38,265
把房产税交了 我明天怎么也把剩下的补上
Pay the property tax. I'll get the rest tomorrow somehow.

1162
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,668
我不需要

1163
00:53:40,702 --> 00:53:42,103
什么
What?

1164
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:44,238
我自己对现状负责任
I took care of the situation myself.

1165
00:53:44,272 --> 00:53:47,141
怎么付
How?

1166
00:53:47,175 --> 00:53:49,310
跟北边那些孩子们说
Told a bunch of North Side kids

1167
00:53:49,344 --> 00:53:50,745
Wilco乐队去了你的夜店
that Wilco was playing at your party.

1168
00:53:50,779 --> 00:53:52,747
就像我说的
It's like I said.

1169
00:53:52,781 --> 00:53:55,950
当你穷的时候唯一赚钱方法
The only way to make money when you're poor

1170
00:53:55,984 --> 00:53:58,119
就是偷或者骗
is to steal it or scam it.

1171
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:00,921
要是不用这么赚钱了 记得告诉我哈
But hey, um, let me know if the rules are changing, right,

1172
00:54:00,956 --> 00:54:03,157
还是你准备继续这么干呢
and you're gonna pull this shit again?

1173
00:54:03,191 --> 00:54:07,862
或者我来接管家里的钱
Maybe I'll have to take over the family money, huh?

1174
00:54:32,688 --> 00:54:34,955
你确定吗
Are we sure about this?

1175

他带大了6个好孩子

你看他呀
Look at him.

1177
00:54:40,762 --> 00:54:43,030
他就像能和宝宝对话一样
He's like the baby whisperer.

1178
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,971
