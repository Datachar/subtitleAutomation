25
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:00,485
They're in.

26
00:02:27,777 --> 00:02:30,746
And in retrospect,
city officials regret holding

27
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,615
the gang truce negotiations
at Santa's Village.

28
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,284
In other news,
we're about to go live

29
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:37,469
to Mr. Burns' announcement
of his annual rate hike.

30
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:39,304
Springfielders are about
to find out how much

31
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:42,174
their electricity bills
will go up.

32
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:46,178
I'm being told that Mr. Burns
is approaching the lectern now.

33
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:49,581
Apparently there are a few
stairs he's struggling to climb.

34
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:53,619
He's up the stairs but is now
being buffeted by the breeze.

35
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:56,288
And they've put
some rocks in his pocket and...

36
00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:58,323
we're ready to go.

37
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,111
To decide how much your
electricity bills will rise,

38
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:05,180
I've assembled a team
of distinguished economists

39
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:08,701
and placed plausible rate hike
percentages on their backs.

40
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:11,820
Now we will use unfettered
free market principles

41
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:13,555
to arrive at a number.

42
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,457
Release the hounds.

43
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:18,694
(dogs growling, people shouting)

44
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,281
Notice how the
Keynesians climb trees

45
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:25,134
while the Austrian school
economists hide under rocks.

46
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:26,401
That is
fascinating.

47
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:33,976
And there you have it,
folks, rates will rise

48
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,377
a healthy 17%.

49
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:37,179
And now, to help you disperse...

50
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:40,315
Let me guess, you're going
to release the hounds again.

51
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,483
(chuckling):
Oh, don't be silly.

52
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:44,119
Release the radioactive steam.

53
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,822
(screaming)

54
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:49,391
Electricity costs
are going up 17%.

55
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:51,477
(laughing):
This station can't afford that.

56
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:53,929
We're barely keeping
the lights on as it is.

57
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:55,197
I know it's a
kid's show,

58
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:56,365
but I got to
see you topless.

59
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,534
This isn't
your dressing room.

60
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:00,335
I know, but the
monkey's got a girl

61
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,871
in <i>my</i> dressing room.

62
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:06,341
The decision to pull
the plug is never easy.

63
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,911
Particularly with
the 17% rate hike.

64
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:10,746
Do I get a vote?

65
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,949
That's just air
escaping his lungs.

66
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:22,191
Oh, I guess we'll be peeling
our shrimp by hand this year.

67
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:24,259
We can keep the shrimp
de-veiner, though, right?

68
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:25,561
I'm afraid not.

69
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,331
And this goes, too.

70
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,452
When I found out
shrimp cocktails had no alcohol,

71
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:34,987
I really lost interest.

72
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:37,756
Children,
we can no longer afford

73
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,625
to use anything electric.

74
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,694
However, we will still be able
to watch today's film,

75
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,114
thanks to the magic
of potato power.

76
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,990
NARRATOR: <i>Sometimes Y:</i> the story

77
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:56,859

78
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:01,497
Emergency meeting in the
faculty lounge. BYOB.

79
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,715
Well, class,
I don't mind leaving you,

80
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,301
because one of you is my spy.

81
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:09,071
You said
you weren't going to tell.

82
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:11,306
Oh, wait, you didn't.

83
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:15,477
So no one knows
who the Milhouse is.

84
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:18,280
The school is broke.

85
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:20,582
I had to sell
all the trombone mutes.

86
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:22,184
(wah-wah)

87
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:23,852
(groans)
Why did I sell one to Nelson?

88
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:25,420
(wah-wah)

89
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:26,955
Hmm. Sounds better than
half the kids in the band.

90
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,757
So does a leaf blower.

91
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,760
Look, the district can't afford
to keep every school open,

92
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:34,830
so all the kids will take
a standardized test.

93
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:37,833
Whichever school scores the
lowest will be closed forever.

94
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:39,918
So you're saying, if our kids
don't pass this test,

95
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:42,154
you're shutting down
Springfield Elementary?

96
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:44,590
I don't teach to the test.
I teach 'em to dodge balls.

97
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:46,024
Things they can use in life.

98
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,025
How is that useful?

99
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,143
Ow.

100
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:50,279
We all came here
to avoid scrutiny.

101
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:51,847
Who else would
hire a lunch lady

102
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,682
accused of poisoning
her husband?

103
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:54,683
Never convicted.

104
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:56,151
They couldn't
find the body.

105
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:58,487
Anyone care for some
chicken-Pete pie?

106
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,989
Did you say "chicken-Pete pie"?

107
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:02,491
His friends called him Pete.

108
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:09,331
Good-bye, my electrical friends.

109
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:12,017
I can't afford to use you,
so I'm doing what any good

110
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:14,303
American would do:
throw you away.

111
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:15,337
(gasps)

112
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:21,476
(gasps)
And it still works.

113
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:23,679
This could come in handy.

114
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:26,348
Ah, ah, ah, but let me check
that list of things

115
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:28,517
Marge said never to bring home.

116
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:33,722
Dogs, cats, octopuses,
octopi, octopuseseseses.

117
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:36,992
Parking meter,
you're working for me now.

118
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:39,928
Mannequin heads,
you're working for me now.

119
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:41,630
Lot of people at the dump today.

120
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:55,577
The proctors
are here.

121
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:57,579
Their leader seems
to be a woman.

122
00:06:57,614 --> 00:06:59,248
Catalog poses.

123
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:07,623
<i>("Halloween</i> Main Theme"

124
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:33,582

grading those tests?

125
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:36,385
I hate waiting; that's
why I hate risotto.

126
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,619
Even mushroom
risotto?

127
00:07:37,654 --> 00:07:39,121
What do you think?!

128
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:40,455
So...
(chuckles nervously)

129
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,090
...how'd we do?

130
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,543
Not as bad as the worst school
in the state.

131
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:45,911
Oh, thank God.

132
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:48,613
You did <i>worse</i> than the
worst school in the state,

133
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:49,881
which now makes
this school

134
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,717
the worst school
in the state.

135
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,952
Why did you say that to us
in the meanest way you could?

136
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:56,905
To show you
that there's no way out.

137
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:58,974
Except...
Except what?

138
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:01,243
No, I meant you should
<i>accept</i> your terrible fate.

139
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:02,978
Oh.

140
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,455
This place
is worse

141
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,390
than the elementary
school in prison.

142
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,510
This student filled in
everything <i>but</i> the ovals.

143
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:15,978
In art school
he'd be a genius.

144
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:17,179
This isn't an art school.

145
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:19,314
We tried to have ourselves
accredited as one,

146
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,817
but no one here could,
uh, draw the pirate.

147
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,185
Children, Groundskeeper Willie
will direct you

148
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:24,720
to your new school district.

149
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,523
Any correlation to your talents,
needs, or friends

150
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:29,658
is completely coincidental.

151
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:32,161
Sherri, you're going
to West Ogdenville.

152
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:33,962
Terri, North Haverbrook.

153
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:36,581
But we've never
been separated.

154
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,351
I'm not sure
we can even live apart.

155
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,990
Stop your whinging.

156
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,993
It's not like you're losing
a rake or a backhoe.

157
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,063
Nelson, you're off to
Arkham Elementary School

158
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,098
for the
Criminally Insane.

159
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,570
(whistling)

160
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,739
Well, I'm glad
you're not upset.

161
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,824
All my extra credit
points are like

162
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,561
frequent flyer miles
on a bankrupt airline.

163
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:08,330
Hey, don't blame me.
I didn't even take the test.

164
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:09,531
You didn't?

165
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,433
Is there no limit
to your disrespect?

166
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,135
Eh, I had
something better to do.

167
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:18,557
(laughing)

168
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,468
Driving you crazy instead
of pulling off your legs.

169
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,703
I've really matured.

170
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,772
Wait a minute.

171
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,924
If you take the test now,
your score could raise

172
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,745
the average
and save the school.

173
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,699
Proctor Clarkson, one student
still hasn't taken the test.

174
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,485
(gasping) Let it be Martin,
let it be Martin.

175
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,319
It's Bart.

176
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,954
(all groaning)

177
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,422
I have an aunt named Hope.

178
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,257
Perhaps you'd like
to kill her as well.

179
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,826
Bart will
take his exam

180
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,728
first thing
tomorrow morning.

181
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,831
Bart, I'm begging you
to try and study.

182
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,668
When I think begging, I don't
imagine someone standing up.

183
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,753
Sorry, I can't
grant a favor

184
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:06,772
to someone I don't
respect anymore.

185
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,241
You can spin in my chair!

186
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,260
Whee!

187
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:13,528
Spinner!
Slow down.

188
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:20,135
(chuckles)

189
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:24,406
Well, sure the Lord wouldn't
have placed his meter there

190
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,308
if he didn't want me to park.

191
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,514
This is the easiest money
I've ever made.

192
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,150
Lugging around
a 90-pound parking meter.

193
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:40,956
It's not
that kind.

194
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,798
All right, now to drag
the meter to the next idiot.

195
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:52,034
Oh, God, my back.

196
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,535
(laughing)

197
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,536
Suckers.

198
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,773
Oh, my disks are grinding.

199
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:00,442
(laughing)

200
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,677
Easy money.

201
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,011
(grunting)

202
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:04,630
♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

203
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,933
♪ Turn and face
the strange ch-ch-changes ♪

204
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,337
♪ Don't wanna be a richer man

205
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,207
♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

206
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,710
♪ Turn and face
the strange ch-ch-changes. ♪

207
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,149
(laughing)

208
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,318
Thanks for the
freedom of speech, dorks.

209
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,587
(whistling)

210
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,489
Uh, we're cool, right, boy?

211
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,624
Nothing a few George
Washingtons won't solve.

212
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,494
(grunts)

213
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,264
Now, to sleep
the sleep of the just.

214
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,298
(sighs)

215
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:45,887
(humming)

216
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,663
Godspeed, old chum.

217
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,432
Pass the test
and your lunch money is yours.

218
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,235
I'm a kid you've never seen,
and I speak for all

219
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:01,553
the kids you've
never seen.

220
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,457
Do it, man, or you'll
never see us again.

221
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:11,113
Principal Skinner, could you help me
sharpen this pencil?

222
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,615
I guess a little circular
grinding might relax me.

223
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,718
I can't do this.
I'm not ready.

224
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,086
You really didn't study?

225
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,955
Well, I slept
on my books,

226
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,757
so I might have gotten
something through osmosis.

227
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,759
So, you know what osmosis is?

228
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:25,627
Uh, pajamas?

229
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,896
Let me make this crystal
clear to you, Simpson.

230
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,631
If you don't
pass this test,

231
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,733
it will destroy the school.

232
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,257
(laughing)

233
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:47,597
Our entire school riding on
that coffee can head of yours.

234
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:49,499
We've got to get you
more time to study.

235
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:50,533
But how?

236
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:53,369
Pull the fire alarm.

237
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:55,071
I'd do it,
but everyone's looking at me.

238
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:02,178
What to do, what to do?

239
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,513
Don't do it, Seymour.

240
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,915
You've never broken
school rules. Ever.

241
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:07,083
You wimp.

242
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:10,136
(alarm ringing)

243
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:14,641
Children, remain calm,
find your disaster buddy,

244
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:16,409
which is different
from your lab partner

245
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:18,261
but may be the same
as your lunchroom buddy.

246
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:20,313
BART:
Well, well, well...

247
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:24,984
Looks like Mr. Vanilla
just grew some chocolate chips.

248
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:28,538
Save your analogies for the
analogy portion of the exam.

249
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:30,206
I bought you time, boy.
Don't blow it.

250
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:31,758
I won't.

251
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:34,460
I'm going to ignore everything
else on my schedule.

252
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:38,498
Pass this test
and the eggs are on me.

253
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:41,417
They will be, Seymour.
They will be.

254
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:45,655
(laughing)

255
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:47,657
I'm king of the bus station.

256
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,594
Meter, meter,
quarter cheater?

257
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:54,330
A rogue parking meter has been
terrorizing the streets.

258
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:57,633
Experts estimate the cost
to taxpayers at north of $50.

259
00:13:57,668 --> 00:13:59,152
That's right, Kent.

260
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:01,120
The entire force is on
the lookout for anyone

261
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:03,172
with an excessive
amount of change.

262
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,175
Our top criminologists
have a theory

263
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,778
as to what the suspect
just might look like.

264
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,680
But, of course,
that question mark could be

265
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:12,415
an exclamation point
or an interrobang.

266
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:15,852
And the man or woman
could be Hispanic or,

267
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:20,156
most frightening,
contain no punctuation at all.

268
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,768
So, how's the studying going?

269
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:33,069
When I start I'll tell you.

270
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:37,273
This is the most selfish
thing you've ever done.

271
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:39,859
You're letting your friends
go hang because you

272
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:43,529
are lazy and selfish and, hey,
are you falling asleep

273
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:44,897
just to spite me?

274
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,624
Hey, why aren't
you eating that?

275
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:57,026
There's four of us
and eight slices.

276
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,795
We don't know how
to divide it.

277
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:02,982
Something Stu forgot
the music he loves.

278
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:07,086
Mrs. Krabappel?
Are you a teacher of the night?

279
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:08,855
Ha, I wish I
was a hooker.

280
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,723
No one in this town
has any money.

281
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:13,025
But the worst thing is what's
happened to the school.

282
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,378
No, no!

283
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,713
(all grumbling)

284
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,317
(groans)

285
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:22,852
What have I done?

286
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:26,672
Spinach farm, huh?

287
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:28,841
That's right,
you talk in your sleep.

288
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:31,410
Lisa, I want to
pass that test.

289
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:32,945
But I need your help.

290
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,781
I have all sorts of problems:

291
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:37,049
Lack of attention,
I'm afraid of ovals,

292
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:38,701
I only know 24 letters.

293
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:40,419
Don't you fall asleep on me.

294
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:46,025
Excuse me,
you're that proctor

295
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,528
that's shutting down
my children's school.

296
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:49,962
I don't shut anything down.

297
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:51,731
People cut their own heads,

298
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:53,599
and I just tip 'em
into the basket.

299
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:57,436
You've been in public education
a long time, haven't you?

300
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:09,832
(grunting)

301
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:14,403
Freeze,
Jack Nickel-scum.

302
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:16,088
Wha...?

303
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:18,975
You know what they do
to parking meter thieves in prison?

304
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,877
They probably treat 'em
pretty well.

305
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:24,113
But when you get out, you're
not eligible for jury duty.

306
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,982
Which, again,
sounds pretty good.

307
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:29,552
Eat silver, copper.

308
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:30,720
D'oh!

309
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:32,021
(tires screeching)

310
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,959
Stay with me, man.

311
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:38,261
Stay with me.

312
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:43,232
No, no!

313
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:46,969
You're the first successful
business I've ever run.

314
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:49,772
It's hopeless.

315
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:52,308
I can't make up for ten years
of goofing off in one day.

316
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:53,976
I need two days.

317
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:57,013
Look, the thing is,
it's more important to know

318
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:59,348
how to take a test
than knowing what's on it.

319
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:00,983
So do the ones you know first.

320
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:03,286
If you don't know one,
guess "B" and move on.

321
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,789
Now, what is the capital
of Massachusetts?

322
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:08,524
Uh, "B"?

323
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,659
Very good.

324
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:16,996
(ticking)

325
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:20,353
BART:
<i>Okay, this is it. Do or die.</i>

326
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,421
D'oh. Will you stop that?

327
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,644
Burly Paper Towels,
Burlyville, Minnesota.

328
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,546
Dear Sir or Madam:

329
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,416
Your paper towel packets
promised 102 sheets of towels.

330
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:37,419
But I was blessed
to receive 103.

331
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:39,621
I'm returning
the extra towel, unused...

332
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:41,924
(jingling)
Hmm?

333
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:45,060
A pillow case full
of quarters?

334
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:46,895
Where did you get
that money?

335
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,897
And what have you done
with the pillows?

336
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:51,600
The pillows are safe
at my workstation.

337
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:52,985
As for the quarters, well,

338
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,771
I'm ashamed to tell
you what I did.

339
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:57,639
How long have
you been in there?

340
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:03,078
Well, we're going
to turn this change

341
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:04,630
into change for the better.

342
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:05,647
Whoo-hoo!

343
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:08,183
And I wish that Mr. Teeny
gets a banana,

344
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:09,819
that the Isotopes emerge
from this season

345
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,086
with a great blooper reel.

346
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:12,754
I wish that
wishing wells worked

347
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:15,908
so I wasn't tossing
my money away

348
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:17,910
and that Marge
loves me forever

349
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:22,147
no matter what
stupid things I do.

350
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:23,248
(grunts)

00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:24,933
(splash)

352
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:28,670
And I hope Bart passes his
test and saves the school.

353
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,306
Way to get us back
on topic, Marge.

354
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:40,015
If you have to
guess, guess "B."

355
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:44,720
Not every
question!

356
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:48,557
The second that boy fails,
we're knocking down this school.

357
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:50,292
Please have
a little faith.

358
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:51,627
I hear you,
Seymour.

359
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:53,395
Start the upswing!

360
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:00,502
The least common blood type is
A) B,

361
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:03,071
B) A, C) AB,

362
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:05,691
D) O... d'oh!
Ten more seconds.

363
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:09,511
<i>("Halloween</i> Main Theme"
by John Carpenter playing)

364
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:23,575
And the last
answer, "C."

365
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:27,512
Is correct.

366
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:30,532
Congratulations,
you made it by one.

367
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,200
That'll do, bug, that'll do.

368
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:35,220
<i>("Superman</i> Theme"
by John Williams playing)

369
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:39,324
He passed.

370
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,375
Stop that ball!

371
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:44,730
Now your mom can see you
work from her house.

372
00:19:44,764 --> 00:19:46,865
Seymour, stop
slouching!

373
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,343
I'm not sure if you gave
my son any extra help,

374
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:00,545
but if you did,
thank you.

375
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,615
Perhaps this was
a test of my humanity.

376
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,251
A test I like
to think I passed.

377
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:10,455
Would you like to have coffee
or dinner, or just talk?

378
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,308
None of the above.

379
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:15,093
Testward ho!

380
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:21,433

383
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:30,792
Is this Wilson
Elementary?

384
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:32,661
No.
Sorry.

386
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:28,087
Shh!
