1
00:00:00,214 --> 00:00:02,354
Previously on Pretty Little Liars.

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:03,457
I'm scared.

3
00:00:03,458 --> 00:00:04,522
All I can think about is

4
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,749
when the next bad thing is gonna happen.

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,176
He left my apartment to go beat her.

6
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,462
The next day she was missing.

7
00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:12,335
He was with my mother the entire night.

8
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:13,594
Did he tell you that?

9
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:15,084
You're going back to Bucks County?

10
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:17,524
I am exactly where I need to be.

11
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:24,595
I found these in his dresser.
Those are mine.

12
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:27,240
I don't think Byron knows
we have those pages.

13
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,316
If you want, I can take them... no.
Don't worry. I hid them.

14
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:32,819
I don't want to see you, I
don't want to hear from you,

15
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,376
and I don't want to know you.

16
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:44,260
What is this?

17
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:49,318
Some kind of herb thing. It's
Meredith's cure-all recipe.

18
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:52,472
I don't think it's working.
You look terrible.

19
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:53,784
Thank you.

20
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:56,277
Oh, God...

21
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:00,394
I couldn't have picked a
worse time to get sick.

22
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:02,363
Have you heard from your dad?

23
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:05,898
He left a message, but I
haven't talked to him

24
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,351
since he left for his conference.

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,595
Hey. How's the patient?

26
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:13,133
Not great.

27
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:14,321
Well...

28
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:17,066
I brought over everything
that helps me when I'm sick.

29
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:18,992
Trash...

30
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:21,861
Ginger ale...

31
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:26,003
And three seasons of "saved by the bell."

32
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:27,384
Thank you, Hanna.

33
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,070
Are you sure you want to
stay here by yourself?

34
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,597
Guys, I'm fine. You don't look fine.

35
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:36,186
So I've heard.

36
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,529
You sure you don't want us
to drive you to your mom's?

37
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:42,010
No, it's her week with Mike, so
the guest room's already taken.

38
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:44,121
And besides, I promised Meredith

39
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:45,828
that I wouldn't tell her about Ali's diary

40
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:48,737
until we talked to my dad, so
if I just stay away from her,

41
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:50,214
it's easier to keep that a secret.

42
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:52,549
I can't believe we're trusting Meredith.

43
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:55,874
I think she's really just
as devastated as I am.

44
00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:57,843
You're not giving her the pages, right?

45
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:00,045
No, they're hidden in a safe place,

46
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:02,226
and they'll stay there
till my dad get home.

47
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:06,026
Then we'll give him the
chance to tell us the truth.

48
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:07,528
And if he doesn't?

49
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:12,040
I don't want to believe that
my dad could have hurt Ali.

50
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:15,804
But if he did do it...

51
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:20,295
This is a family secret that I can't keep.

52
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,141
We're set for tomorrow.

53
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,250
It's too soon. Did Spencer
say something to you?

54
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:53,242
She's still lying to me...

55
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:56,507
pretending "a" went away when
they took you to Radley.

56
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,754
That bitch can keep a secret.

57
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:02,416
I respect that.

58
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:09,647
I still feel like we're rushing this.

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,495
I told you... I'm not the
one calling the shots.

60
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:18,843
Fear cuts deeper than a sword.

61
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:25,429
They need to understand
that she's in charge.

62
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,409
Well, then, I'll take care of it.

63
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,230

64
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,099
Today's drip. Black.

65
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:13,415
Thanks, em. Thank you for letting me hang.

66
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:19,510
Mmm . How'd they get you to
open up the brew this morning?

67
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:23,523
Kinda got drafted. I'm running
over to Spencer's for a shower.

68
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,748
The plumber won't be here until nine.
Great.

69
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:27,605
I've got some reading to do.

70
00:04:28,316 --> 00:04:30,746
"Lord of the flies." Your pick or theirs?

71
00:04:30,747 --> 00:04:32,411
Theirs. I don't mind.

72
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:34,509
I kind of identify with those boys.

73
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,956
Feel like I've been on that island.
With the girls.

74
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:40,416
We did it the right way... we
stuck together no matter what.

75
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,299
You are thick as thieves.

76
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:44,928
We knew "a" was trying to tear us apart.

77
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:47,392
Mona actually brought us closer together.

78
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:50,896
And we know that now.
We're stronger for it.

79
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:53,763
So you actually have
something to thank her for.

80
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,663
I wouldn't go that far.

81
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:58,255
Now that she back in rosewood,

82
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:00,550
Mona's leaving you alone, right?

83
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,105
She... Seems to be a model citizen.

84
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,049
You'd tell me if things started up again...

85
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,953
Wouldn't you?

86
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:09,475
Of course.

87
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,981
I gotta get back to the flies.

88
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,888
Oh, hey, em, could you
lock up on your way out?

89
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,319
Sure.

90
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:39,604
Hey, Spence. Mission accomplished.

91
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:42,133
He's on his way to your
house, and I got the keys.

92
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:44,746
Okay...

93
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:47,485
Which one screams "young and hot"

94
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:49,277
without being too trendy?

95
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:51,385
You're asking me?

96
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:54,474
Hanna, I've had this
hoodie since I was twelve.

97
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:57,369
Caleb, come on, this is important.
I have to impress Corin.

98
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:00,701
It's a job interview. You're
not walking the runway.

99
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:02,848
She's the hottest designer in Philly.

100
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:04,751
It'd be a privilege to
get her a cup of coffee.

101
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:06,513
She wants you to do it in five-inch heels?

102
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:07,768
Yeah, at least.

103
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:12,577
All right, go with the dress.

104
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:17,012
But just to be sure, you should
probably try it on for me.

105
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:19,175
I'll be right back.

106
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:28,926
Hey. Ohh. Forgot my shoes.

107
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,082
Yeah, I thought a lot about it.

108
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:32,782
I'm in.

109
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,532
I'm not gonna let her do
anything else to Hanna.

110
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:39,045
We'll talk this afternoon.

111
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:41,707
Who were you talking to?

112
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:44,192
Um, it was my mom.

113
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,791
It's four-thirty in California.

114
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,591
Do you always call her this early?

115
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:51,383
She's not in Montecito. She's, um...

116
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,815
In Chicago, uh, for business.

117
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:58,264
So why were you talking to
your mom about Mona and me?

118
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,442
She knows that Mona bullied you,

119
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:03,523
and she's just worried about
her being back in school.

120
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:06,703
Mona had someone run your mom off the road.

121
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:08,809
You shouldn't be talking
about her to anyone.

122
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:11,850
Hanna, Mona tried to run you
over when you were friends.

123
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,744
God only knows what she's gonna
do now that you've dumped her.

124
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:16,225
Maybe she won't do anything.

125
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:18,176
Of course she will. She's "a."

126
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,677
We need to stay one step ahead of her.

127
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:23,903
Look, just promise me that you
won't do anything stupid.

128
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:26,160
Hanna... promise me.

129
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,704
Fine. I won't do anything stupid.

130
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,600
Now let's see something
hot and not-too-trendy.

131
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,988
I promise today is the last time

132
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,974
that they'll have to shut
the water off in the loft.

133
00:07:57,632 --> 00:07:59,847
I already told you, I don't
really have a problem with it.

134
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:01,852
You sure you can't come over later and...

135
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:04,330
Check out the new tub?

136
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,676
I hate that I can't see you tonight.

137
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:11,570
But they're honoring my dad at this dinner,

138
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,077
so of course I have to be there.

139
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:16,090
I understand.

140
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,337
We will celebrate tomorrow. Yeah.

141
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:22,154
Toby.

142
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:25,915
Ahh.

143
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:28,413
You know that I could fix this, right?

144
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,000
Three years ago I made an exact replica

145
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:33,214
of Mary queen of scots' execution dress

146
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:34,604
for my Halloween costume,

147
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,371
and I didn't have a pattern.

148
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:39,046
Is there anything that you can't do?

149
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,403
Yes. Get out of this stupid dinner

150
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:44,794
that's keeping me from
you on our anniversary.

151
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:51,533
Uh... I was just about to go in
the other room and get dressed.

152
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:53,801
I thought I'd help you decide
on what to wear to the dinner

153
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:55,759
that you're so obviously agog about.

154
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,348
Are you sure that dad'll
be upset if I don't go?

155
00:08:58,837 --> 00:08:59,864
Well, he has to sit through it,

156
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:02,042
so he wants his family
to sit through it, too.

157
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:03,901
Misery loves company.

158
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:06,197
I'll... I'll find my way out.

159
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,329
Toby.

160
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,359
You forgot your shirt.

161
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:14,254
Bye.

162
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:22,392
How'd I do? Awesome. He has no clue.

163
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:23,883
I copied grandma's recipe.

164
00:09:23,884 --> 00:09:25,093
Oh, thank you.

165
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:28,034
Ohh. What?

166
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,744
I made that lasagna for your
father on our first anniversary.

167
00:09:33,017 --> 00:09:35,513
Toby's gonna love it. Thank you.

168
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:37,802
And thank you for my cover story.

169
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,213
I hope he likes surprises.

170
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:41,797
I'm counting on it.

171
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:02,793
Hey.

172
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:05,697
How are you feeling?

173
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:07,452
Not that great.

174
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:12,241
Have I been sleeping all day?

175
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,501
No, it's not quite lunchtime.

176
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:17,252
I had a break in classes, so I
thought I'd check in on you.

177
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:21,471
You feel really warm.

178
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:24,152
I think I need to see a doctor.

179
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:25,848
I was gonna call my mom...

180
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,026
my phone was just right here.

181
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:34,911
I'll look for it.

182
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:38,689
But we need to get you upstairs.

183
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:40,907
You'll sleep so much better in bed.

184
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:43,900
Can you just have my mom call me?

185
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:46,979
Yeah. I'll find her as soon
as I get back to the school.

186
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:49,612
I'm sure she'll come over right away.

187
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:51,664
Thank you.

188
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:53,266
I bet the stress of your dad

189
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:55,503
and those diary pages brought this on.

190
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,920
I can't even think about that right now.

191
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,607
No, of course not.

192
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,820
But you put those pages
in a safe place, right?

193
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:08,921
Aria?

194
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:18,254
Rosemary chicken? Kale salad?

195
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,859
What did I do to deserve this?

196
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:21,806
I thought since you
weren't up for going out,

197
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,456
I'd bring all your favorites to you.

198
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:28,095
So, have you given any thought
to what I said the other night?

199
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:29,083
About what?

200
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,880
About seeing someone to
help you with the anxiety.

201
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:36,402
Actually, I did. I found someone.

202
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:39,242
And I made an appointment
for this afternoon.

203
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:42,015
Really? I figured talking to someone

204
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:44,187
who understands what I'm
going through can only help.

205
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:46,246
Thanks for the push.

206
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:47,736
Of course.

207
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:52,647
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

208
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:55,421
Uh, I have to borrow Emily
for some girl talk.

209
00:11:56,277 --> 00:12:00,283
Not girl-on-girl talk, just... Girl talk.

210
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,987
Um, right now?

211
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:03,837
I'm really sorry. It's just important.

212
00:12:04,063 --> 00:12:05,718
She's all yours. Okay.

213
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:13,674
What's up? I called you a couple times.

214
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:14,984
Yeah. I been busy.

215
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:18,705
I need a favor from you, and I
normally wouldn't ask this,

216
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:20,399
but I have an interview today,

217
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,878
Aria's sick, and Spencer
is surprising Toby...

218
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,407
okay, slow down. I need you to follow Caleb

219
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,930
after school and see where he's going.

220
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:27,572
Follow him. Why?

221
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,434
I heard him on the phone this morning,

222
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:32,343
and he's meeting someone.
They were talking about Mona.

223
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:34,067
I think he's gonna shut her down.

224
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:36,991
Okay. I love you, Hanna,
but I'm not in the C.I.A.

225
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,322
I don't know the first thing
about tailing someone.

226
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:42,223
It's easy. You just stay far
enough away so he doesn't see you,

227
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:43,728
but not so far that you lose him.

228
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,502
What if he does see me? You lie.

229
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:47,584
You just say that you
happened to be in the area.

230
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,701
How do you know this?

231
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:52,194
My mom used to take me with her
when we were following my dad.

232
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:55,343
When she thought that he was
hooking up with Isabel.

233
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:56,788
He was hooking up with Isabel.

234
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:58,655
Yeah. My point exactly.

235
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:01,909
Look, if the roles were reversed
and Paige was in danger,

236
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,577
you know I'd do it for you.

237
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:14,404
Ella. I was just coming to see you.

238
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:16,809
Ah. Here I am.

239
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:19,348
I stopped by to see Aria on my break.

240
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,486
I thought you'd want to know
she's feeling a lot better.

241
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,376
Oh. That's great.

242
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:27,784
I didn't want to call and
wake her if she was sleeping,

243
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:29,330
but I'll give her a call now.

244
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,340
Um, thanks for letting me know.

245
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:33,473
Of course.

246
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:36,989
And, uh, thanks for checking on her.

247
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,542
My pleasure. Really. She's a lovely girl.

248
00:15:58,187 --> 00:15:58,969
Corin?

249
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:02,176
Hello?

250
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:08,787
Hello? It's Hanna marin.

251
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:10,723
Hello?

252
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:25,219
Oh, my God.

253
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,600
Help!

254
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,039
Somebody help me!

255
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:35,333
Uhh!

256
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,303
Come on.

257
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:37,810
Thanks for meeting me. I'm
sorry you had to lie to Hanna.

258
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:39,967
Some lies are worth the risk.

259
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:42,195
It took me and Emily so
long to get to a place

260
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:43,466
where we could trust each other.

261
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:46,225
If she knew we were doing
this... same with Hanna.

262
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,110
She would find a way to stop us.

263
00:18:50,536 --> 00:18:52,497
I've been running scared
since the lighthouse,

264
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,105
getting more afraid every day.

265
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:56,514
Then the other night I realized

266
00:18:57,103 --> 00:19:00,339
I'm not afraid for me...
I'm afraid for Emily.

267
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:02,911
She's been dealing with this for so long

268
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:05,496
it's almost like she's numb
to how dangerous it is.

269
00:19:06,051 --> 00:19:06,786
Yeah.

270
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:12,054
We know that Mona has people
watching their every move.

271
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,889
But there's no way that's she has someone

272
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,710
watching all of us all the time.

273
00:19:17,202 --> 00:19:19,130
So while the girls are
playing sitting duck,

274
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,074
I'm ready to circle the pond and...

275
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:22,827
nail her psychotic butt to the wall.

276
00:19:23,702 --> 00:19:25,622
Yeah, something like that.

277
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:28,661
Before she went to Radley, Mona had, like,

278
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:30,317
all the girls' secrets locked

279
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:32,600
away in a motel room...
they were her trophies.

280
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:34,005
Her prized possessions.

281
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,183
That's what she used to keep the
girls from going to the cops.

282
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:40,429
So if we find her trophy room,
we can put an end to this.

283
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,735
Corin moved her store to
society hill a month ago.

284
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,709
Did you tell Mona you applied
for a job there? No,

285
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,266
I applied months ago online.

286
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:57,866
She's just doing this to get
back at me for cutting her off.

287
00:19:57,867 --> 00:20:00,392
No, it wasn't her. I saw
her at school around four.

288
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:02,799
Then it was her Minion.

289
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:09,982
Is she threatening to cut your face off?

290
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:11,238
Or throw acid at her.

291
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:12,853
You guys, come on.

292
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:15,390
Shall we give this key to the cops?

293
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:17,930
There's a numerical code on it.
Maybe they could trace it.

294
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:19,192
Even if they could trace it,

295
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:21,269
are you ready to talk about Mona 2.0?

296
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,321
That's what we would have
to do if we turned it in.

297
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:25,692
For all we know, it's not
just Mona and her Minion.

298
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:28,368
Maybe she's built this whole "a" army.

299
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:30,611
We still don't know what her endgame is.

300
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:33,983
I do. It's to cut my face off.
I hear you guys,

301
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,753
but she still has all those
pictures of us at Ali's grave.

302
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:40,046
You know what? I don't care anymore.
She has to be stopped.

303
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,744
You're right. But this decision
is going to affect all of us.

304
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:47,955
Aria has to be in on it too. Has
anyone talked to her today?

305
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,131
I tried her phone, but
all I get is voicemail.

306
00:20:50,618 --> 00:20:52,755
Me too. She's probably still sleeping.

307
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,041
Let's just wait. We'll talk
about it in the morning.

308
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:00,733
I gotta get ready for tonight.

309
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:04,854
Spence, have fun tonight.

310
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:08,331
We'll worry about all this tomorrow.
Thanks.

311
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:10,232
If you really want to surprise Toby,

312
00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:12,295
have on five-inch heels and

313
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:13,821
nothing else when he
walks through the door.

314
00:21:15,263 --> 00:21:18,039
What? I've heard guys like that.

315
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:19,598
Thanks for the tip.

316
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:17,933
Hey, what are you doing?

317
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:25,521
I'm taking back what's mine.

318
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:26,832
Is this a dream?

319
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:29,596
No, sweetie,

320
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,411
I'm more real than I've ever been.

321
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:38,427
Tell me what it's like. Tell me everything.

322
00:22:38,428 --> 00:22:39,563
Well...

323
00:22:40,897 --> 00:22:42,746
I don't know who said knowledge was king...

324
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:44,752
just an old fart, probably...

325
00:22:45,793 --> 00:22:48,560
but he was right. I see everything now.

326
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:51,423
I missed so much when I was here.

327
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:53,517
Do you see "a"?

328
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:55,265
Everywhere I turn.

329
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:57,100
So do you.

330
00:22:58,264 --> 00:22:59,526
You all do.

331
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:02,295
I'm surprised Spencer
hasn't figured that out.

332
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,574
Did it really happen, what
you wrote in those pages?

333
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,836
Were you blackmailing my dad?

334
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:16,374
Byron's really coming around, isn't he?

335
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:20,333
I mean, when the chips were
down with Ezra's mom. Ali...

336
00:23:21,504 --> 00:23:22,819
I need to know the truth.

337
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:26,522
If I tell you the truth, you
don't have to believe it.

338
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:28,241
Please.

339
00:23:30,134 --> 00:23:31,828
I was desperate for that money.

340
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:36,216
How could you do that to my family?

341
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:38,013
To me?

342
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,357
It was just a threat.

343
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,958
I never called your mom.

344
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:46,844
Did my dad kill you?

345
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:50,465
Do I look dead to you?

346
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,042
I wouldn't drink that.

347
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,298
What do you mean?

348
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,818
Meredith is looking for these pages too.

349
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,025
Ali, wait.

350
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:13,582
You know why I picked you, right?

351
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:03,412
What the...

352
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:06,860
hello!

353
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,809
Feed scalp. Feed beauty. Still hurts?

354
00:25:23,316 --> 00:25:24,947
Kyle Bown, on the boys' swim team,.

355
00:25:24,948 --> 00:25:26,829
He can bend his wrist
all the way to his arm,

356
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,366
and it doesn't even hurt him.
I think he's double-jointed.

357
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,033
And you're telling me this because?

358
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:32,399
What do you mean you can't refill it?

359
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,772
You refilled this prescription last week.

360
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:37,368
Yeah, I know, but I...
misplaced my pill bottle.

361
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:40,899
I'm sorry, ma'am. Clonazepam
is a class 3 medication.

362
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,575
You can ask your doctor to
call in another prescription.

363
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:46,960
I don't have time to call my doctor.
I need those pills now.

364
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:48,677
There's nothing we can do for you tonight.

365
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:50,262
We're closing in a few minutes.

366
00:25:51,062 --> 00:25:53,768
Great. That's just great.

367
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:03,305
Ring me up.

368
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:27,182
It says clonazepam is most
commonly used for anxiety,

369
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:29,420
but some people also use
it to help them sleep.

370
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,953
Either Meredith is a major insomniac

371
00:26:31,954 --> 00:26:33,571
or she's trying to knock out a cow.

372
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,425
I do not like the idea of that
woman nursing Aria back to health.

373
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:47,552
I'm calling her again.

374
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,270
Straight to voicemail.

375
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:42,190
You scared me.

376
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:44,289
I'm sorry. I wanted to surprise you.

377
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,751
You did. Why aren't you at work?

378
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:49,496
I'm on a break, and since I'm
not gonna see you tonight...

379
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,074
Happy anniversary.

380
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:55,438
Oh... they're beautiful.

381
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,994
Thank you.

382
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:01,305
I feel so bad, though. I
didn't get you anything.

383
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,798
It's okay, I didn't expect you to.

384
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:04,756
Let me go put these in water.

385
00:28:18,408 --> 00:28:19,239
"A"?

386
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:21,457
Oh. It's not what you think.

387
00:28:21,863 --> 00:28:25,347
Melissa left it here. She has
a storage unit in Philly.

388
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:34,032
They're so pretty.

389
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:36,625
I better get back to work.

390
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:39,180
Yeah. I better go get
dressed for that dinner.

391
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,672
The sky's looking pretty dark.

392
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:43,721
Maybe I'll get to come home early.

393
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,445
Will you call me if you do?

394
00:28:50,324 --> 00:28:51,058
Love you.

395
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,504
I love you too.

396
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:15,822
Is this what you're looking for?

397
00:29:18,198 --> 00:29:19,607
Quite the clever girl.

398
00:29:20,065 --> 00:29:23,025
I've searched every inch
of this house, twice,

399
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,075
and I can't find those pages anywhere.

400
00:29:25,568 --> 00:29:26,874
Have you been drugging me?

401
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,268
Don't be so dramatic.

402
00:29:28,528 --> 00:29:30,424
I gave you something to help you sleep.

403
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:32,128
Yeah, and you locked me in my room.

404
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:32,839
There's no way I'm letting

405
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,553
you turn those pages over to the police.

406
00:29:34,554 --> 00:29:36,284
It's not really your decision, is it?

407
00:29:36,454 --> 00:29:37,997
Shut up and sit down!

408
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:49,159
I lied to you. My friends
know about that diary.

409
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,320
So whatever it is that you're
thinking, it's not gonna work.

410
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:05,119
What?!

411
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,283
Come on.

412
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,290
She has to be here.

413
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,465
Aria!

414
00:30:37,723 --> 00:30:39,339
Aria, are you in here?

415
00:30:47,768 --> 00:30:50,454
Hey. I just wanted to check in on you.

416
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:54,388
I think I'm gonna make it home
before the storm really hits.

417
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:56,435
Well, good. I'm glad you're on your way.

418
00:30:56,595 --> 00:30:58,073
So how's the dinner?

419
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,386
Ah, it's moving along.

420
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:03,150
Will you be careful? Will do.

421
00:31:03,646 --> 00:31:04,860
Okay, bye.

422
00:31:09,892 --> 00:31:10,882
Here's the key.

423
00:31:20,722 --> 00:31:21,836
Aria?

424
00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:31,235
Come on.

425
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:40,138
Aria?

426
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:00,623
She's not here.

427
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,247
I'm calling her.

428
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:13,877
Meredith? What are you girls
doing out in this storm?

429
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:15,761
Where is Aria? She went down

430
00:32:15,762 --> 00:32:18,225
to the basement to look
for some flashlights.

431
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:19,550
She has been down there a little while.

432
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:21,157
Maybe we should check on her.

433
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:51,500
Aria? Are you down here?

434
00:32:57,437 --> 00:32:59,035
Oh, my God, it's locked.

435
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:00,720
Locked!

436
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,017
Hang on.

437
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:03,693
Okay.

438
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:09,539
Hanna. What?

439
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:13,599
I don't think we're alone down here.

440
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,092
Oh, my God!

441
00:33:29,787 --> 00:33:31,905
Aria? Aria, are you okay?

442
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:34,063
Wake up, wake up. Aria!

443
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:38,988
Wake up!

444
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,227
Aria.

445
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,149
It's gonna be okay, Aria.

446
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,555
No, it's not. She lost it. She's crazy.

447
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:57,990
What is she doing up there?

448
00:33:57,991 --> 00:33:59,834
If Spencer was here she'd
say that she was pacing

449
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:02,135
while she plots her way to get rid of us.

450
00:34:02,136 --> 00:34:03,632
She'd probably be right.

451
00:34:03,993 --> 00:34:06,605
There's three of us and one of her.

452
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:07,415
Let's give her the pages

453
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:09,025
and then we'll take her down.
Take her down?

454
00:34:09,026 --> 00:34:12,440
I have no problem opening a can
of whoop-ass on that woman.

455
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:19,543
It's your dad.

456
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:22,503
He... he wasn't supposed to
be home till tomorrow.

457
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,305
She must have called him.

458
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:26,064
Is he in on this?

459
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,073
I don't know what I believe anymore.

460
00:34:33,182 --> 00:34:34,310
Meredith?

461
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:37,819
Hey, I only heard half your message.

462
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,850
I've been trying to call,
but the phones are out.

463
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:44,631
Meredith? What... what's wrong?

464
00:34:45,174 --> 00:34:46,684
Aria knows everything.

465
00:34:47,478 --> 00:34:49,484
She knows about the blackmail.

466
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:52,791
And she knows that you saw
Alison that night. That you...

467
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:58,914
she has proof, Byron.

468
00:35:00,713 --> 00:35:02,198
And her friends know, too.

469
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,873
What are you doing with that?

470
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,174
We don't know what they're planning.

471
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,705
My dad would never hurt us.

472
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:13,928
Aria? Are you sure about that?

473
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:22,630
Aria?

474
00:35:34,247 --> 00:35:35,483
Are you okay?

475
00:35:42,204 --> 00:35:44,147
You don't need to be afraid of me.

476
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:47,249
I swear. I...

477
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,288
you don't need I didn't hurt Alison.

478
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:51,568
I didn't bring any money.

479
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:53,701
Then we both know how this is gonna end.

480
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:56,684
You know how much it'll hurt
Aria if you make that call.

481
00:35:57,314 --> 00:36:00,047
And I don't think you're
that horrible of a person.

482
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:02,539
Then you clearly don't know me that well.

483
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:08,851
Last chance to save yourself.

484
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,111
Yes, it is.

485
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:21,130
You made your bed, Mr. Montgomery!

486
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:32,451
What do I have to do, call
911 to get your attention?

487
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:45,882
I was prepared to tell your mom the truth.

488
00:36:46,222 --> 00:36:47,979
Then Alison went missing.

489
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:50,858
And the longer she stayed missing,

490
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,495
the harder it became for me to tell anyone.

491
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,323
Is this what you're looking for?

492
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,537
Spencer.

493
00:38:22,528 --> 00:38:23,916
How long have you known?

494
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,790
Spencer?

495
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,334
Hi, honey.

496
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,112
Is everything okay?

497
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:50,638
What is it, honey?

498
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,749
Mommy!

499
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:11,987
I-I called the police, and they
checked Meredith's apartment.

500
00:39:11,988 --> 00:39:13,264
She's gone.

501
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:17,749
You told us about the affair. Why
didn't you tell us about this?

502
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:25,565
When they found Alison's body,

503
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:27,852
it was clear that she had been murdered,

504
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:29,864
and there were no suspects.

505
00:39:30,654 --> 00:39:33,669
I saw her the night she died,
and I knew how that would look.

506
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,420
You mean how it does look.

507
00:39:38,414 --> 00:39:41,229
What started this? How did you find out?

508
00:39:44,511 --> 00:39:46,741
We found an old diary of Ali's.

509
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,752
She wrote about you.

510
00:40:02,813 --> 00:40:05,119
Why didn't... why didn't
you come and talk to me?

511
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,608
I wanted to.

512
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:09,656
But Meredith made me believe
that you actually...

513
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:15,628
I was scared.

514
00:40:16,183 --> 00:40:19,577
Aria, I need to know if
there's any part of you

515
00:40:19,578 --> 00:40:22,080
that still thinks that I
could have done this.

516
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:32,213
I understand.

517
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:37,009
Where are you going?

518
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,457
I'm gonna do something I should
have done a long time ago.

519
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,664
I'm gonna tell the police everything.

520
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,717
And hopefully after whatever
investigation they do

521
00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:48,677
you will realize that I had nothing
to do with Alison's death.

522
00:41:00,317 --> 00:41:01,488
What are you doing?

523
00:41:04,136 --> 00:41:05,430
I believe you.

524
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,551
I know you're in there.

525
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:12,635
Will you...

526
00:42:13,183 --> 00:42:16,294
Will you just tell me that what
I saw tonight wasn't real?

527
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,276
