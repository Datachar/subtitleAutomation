有必要可以发全舰通告
Issue a shipwide announcement if you have to.

8
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:43,154
- 找到他  - 遵命 大副

我知道今早在新兵食堂出了点状况
I understand we had a situation in the Enlisted Galley this morning.

14
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,053
我相信他们只是小打小闹 
I'm sure they were just letting off a little steam, sir.

15
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:01,940
船员们可能对拓展任务有点小紧张
The crew's probably a little stressed from the extended mission.

17
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:04,859
你我都知道没有借口 大副
Oh, you and I both know that's no excuse, Master Chief.

18
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:08,646
如果他们现在紧张了 那到了战场上会是什么鬼样子
If they're stressed now, what the hell are they going to be like in a combat situation?

20
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:10,732
我要看下NCIS的报告
I want to read the NCIS report.

21
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:12,951

That makes two of us, sir.

22
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,539
我们还是没找到舰上特别探员
We still can't find the Special Agent Afloat.

00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:23,962
请NCIS海上特别探员Niles速联系安保长官

实际上 这是我的错

我叫Eric帮我做"给孩子们玩具"的活动
I asked Eric to help me out with the Toys for Tots program

我是给海军陆战队做的

我觉得孩子看着我们装扮下会很好玩
I thought it would be fun for the kids if we were dressed up.

36
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,447
但我恐怕这得等等
But I'm afraid it'll have to wait.

37
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,316
我们失去了一个自己人
We've lost one of our own.

38
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:37,535
集合队伍
Rally the troops.

39

Beale先生
Mr. Beale?

40

不到一周就圣诞节了

要是幸运的话 我们还可以休假几天

很好
Yes!

48
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,964
不 你别想了 我已经决定不做任何事

这不是默认情况
It was not by default.

50
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:11,235
我做了个很清醒的决定 圣诞节不做任何事
I have made a conscious choice not to do anything on Christmas.

58

说啥
Excuse me?

59
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:30,154
滑雪技术很差
At snowboarding?

60
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,590
要知道这需要很高的协调性
just know it takes a lot of coordination.

61
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,759
我们可以给你要个平底雪橇
Maybe we could get you, like, a toboggan.

62
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:36,511
我会滑雪

我从不怀疑你是双黑道级别的
There is no doubt in my mind that that is double-black-diamond rated.

71

还有 我跟我妈妈说了圣诞节陪她

那么叫她也来吧

喝喝热饮
sipping hot cocoa,

看雪从柏树上飘落
watching the snow fall on the cedars.

86

- 去泡温泉  - 哦

00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:25,543
- 你非要这么意淫  - 咋了

88
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:26,544
她是只冷透的狐狸
She's a stone-cold fox.

89
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:27,645
- 你毁了假期  - 我没有
- You ruined it!  - I didn't.

90
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,564
我使它更美好了 不是吗 Nell

You could, if he knew what he was looking for or where he put it.

98
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,168
我可不想再经历一遍去年的小马玩偶的事
I didn't want to go through that whole Parker Pony thing like I did last year,

100
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,502
所以我六月就问我女儿圣诞节想要啥

101

然后马上出门就买好了

为了不让她发现 他藏得很深

00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:43,905
他正因"行为古怪"监视着Allen士官

卧底成不同的船员能让我们查的更广
Going in as different elements of the crew will allow us to cover more ground.

159
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,484

Mm-hmm. Just for the record, this is a gross misuse of my undercover talents.

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,416
别别别 等等
No, no. No, no, no, no, wait.

169
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:27,801
我正在做一些
Just got to do a little, uh,

170
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:29,753
卧底人物的记忆工作
sense memory work for my undercover character, you know.

171
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:31,921
红皮革 黄皮革 红皮革 黄皮革
Red leather, yellow leather. Red leather, yellow leather.

172
00:07:31,923 --> 00:07:33,056
开演 哈
Acting, ha!

173
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:35,392
直升机带我们去科罗纳多号
Chopper's here to take us to Coronado.

174
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:41,231
我知道这表情
I know that look.

175
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,651
你越来越像我老婆了
You're starting to sound like my wife.

176
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:47,654
你知道他们怎么说 当你搭档像你老婆时吗
You know what they say when your partner starts sounding like your wife?

178
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:49,022
换个老婆吗
Get a new wife?

179
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:50,657
我要装作没听到
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

180
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,075
看到没 这就是问题所在
See, that's the problem right there.

181
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:53,559
我们俩都不怎么聊了
You and I don't talk.

182
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:56,246
少了交流 关系也很快就淡了
Communication goes, the relationship is soon to follow.

183
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:57,530
说完了吗
Almost finished?

184
00:07:57,532 --> 00:07:58,782
快了
Just about.

185
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:01,951
听着 我知道你想在家过圣诞节
Look, I know you want to be home for Christmas.

186
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:04,170
我都错过了圣诞节 毕业典礼 生日
I've missed Christmas, graduations, birthdays

187
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:06,506
还有其他一切
and everything else doing what we do.

188
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:08,625
那是什么原因
Then what is it?

189
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,684
Sidirov
Sidirov.

190
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:21,304
如果他趁我们不在时回来了咋办
What if he comes back while we're away?

191
00:08:21,306 --> 00:08:24,107
Michelle会做她该做的
Then Michelle will do what she has to do.

192
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:26,309
就和你在这一样
Same is if you were here.

193
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:28,945
没错 但我不在
Yeah. But I won't be.

194
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:30,113
那我们就速度点
Then we'll make this quick.

195
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:31,281
还有 我向你保证
Besides, I guarantee you,

196
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:33,116
Sidirov近期不会来这
Sidirov isn't showing up here anytime soon.

197
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:34,567
你怎么能确定呢
How can you be so sure?

198
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:38,555
罪犯也和我们一样圣诞节要放假
Criminals take Christmas off just like the rest of us.

199
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:41,875
坏人们也不想出现在淘气鬼名单上
Even the bad guys don't like being on the naughty list.

201
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:50,800
海军有着1550亿的预算
The Navy has a budget of $155 billion,

202
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,587
却开这种飞机
and this is the plane that they use?

203
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:56,950
C2灰狗运输机 海中驮马
C2 Greyhound-- workhorse of the sea.

204
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:57,842
嗯
Mm-hmm.

205
00:08:57,843 --> 00:09:01,227
好吧 这马儿得淘汰了（glue factory 收养老马的地方）
Yeah, well, this horse needs to be sent to the glue factory.

206
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:03,480
这或许是你做过的最安全的飞机了
It's probably the safest plane you'll ever fly in.

207
00:09:03,482 --> 00:09:05,131
这安全 搞笑了
Th-This is the safe... Really?

208
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,684
解释给我听听 为嘛我们还得戴着头盔
Okay, explain to me, then, why we're wearing helmets

209
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:09,102
还要穿救生衣
and life preservers.

210
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:10,854
错了就纠正我 是要在水上迫降
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the only time

211
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:13,522
才要穿救生衣的
to wear a life preserver is in the event of a water landing.

212
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:16,159
跟我说说 你知道什么内幕消息
So tell me, do they know something that we don't know?

214
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:18,361
没什么好怕的 Deeks
There is nothing to be afraid of, Deeks.

215
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:20,530
什么 我才不怕 我有着钢铁般的意志
What? I'm not. I have hardened nerves of steel.

216
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:22,282
我只是感到有些不安
I just think it's a little disconcerting

217
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:24,951
者飞机后边开得跟我家的车库一样大
the back of the plane opens like my garage door.

218
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:26,753
就像是会飞的工具房
It's like a flying tool shed.

219
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:28,288
- Deeks - 怎么
- Deeks? - Yeah?

220
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,589
我在睡觉呢
I'm trying to sleep here.

221
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:31,491
好吧 飞机要是坠落到海里
Okay. Well, I'll be sure to wake you up

222
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:32,625
我会叫醒你的
when we crash into the ocean.

223
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:35,178
放松点 牛仔
Hey, just try and relax, Maverick.

224
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,662
啊 你听到了吗
Huh? Did you hear that?

225
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:39,599
怎么感觉有点像壮志凌云的感觉
I look a little Top Gun in this thing, don't I?

226
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:52,979
我收集前几个月的一大堆训练报告
Hey, I gathered a bunch of disciplinary reports from the last several months.

228
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:56,566
找找看有谁跟特别探员Niles有冲突
Trying to find anyone who might have a grudge against Special Agent Niles.

230
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:58,735
听起来不错
That sounds good.

231
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,488
你没事吧
You okay?

232
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,990
没事 好着呢
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

233
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:06,859
Nell
Nell?

234
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:11,297
Nellie
Nellie?

235
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,717
小Nell
Nellster...

236
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:22,041
我很期待这秘密的圣诞聚会
It's just... I was really looking forward to the holiday party and the Secret Santa stuff.


238
00:10:22,043 --> 00:10:25,228
我好傻
It's... it's stupid.

239
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:29,766
我可不这么看
I don't think so.

240
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:33,052
我很期待这假期
I'm so... I just get like this around the holidays.

241
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:36,523
因为回不了家
'Cause I... I can't be home.

242
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:41,110
还有我的同事们
And it's like these people we work with,

243
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:47,033
他们成了我们的家人代替 可他们现在人都不在这
they become...our surrogate family, and they're not here right now.


245
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:49,035
他们会很快回来
They'll be back soon.

246
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:51,504
这么着吧 他们要是不回来
And you know what, even if they're not,

247
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:55,625
我保证我们还是会有节日庆祝的
I promise that we will have a festive holiday celebration.

248
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,746
我是说我会戴上精灵帽子
I mean, I've agreed to wear an elf hat,

249
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:03,099
还有着耳朵
so... And the ears?

250
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:04,934
说什么 还有啥
I'm sorry, the what?

251
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:07,854
你还得戴上这精灵耳朵
You have to wear the elf ears.

252
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:11,441
我记得我没说过要戴着玩意
Um, I don't think I remember you saying anything about any...

253
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:12,692
摆脱啦
Oh, come on.

254
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:15,778
哪有精灵没耳朵的
Hey, what's an elf without ears, right?

255
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,447
对了
Exactly.

256
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:28,908
准备降落
Prepare for landing.

257
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:40,953
无压力 就不知你们担心个啥来着
Piece of cake! I don't know what you guys were so worried about.


259
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:43,056
欢迎来到范布伦号 女士 长官
Welcome aboard the USS Van Buren, ma'am, sirs.

260

261
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,309
要我为你指引方向吗 中校
Can I point you in the right direction, Commander?

262
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:47,727
不用 我没事 特别探员Callen
No, I'm good, thanks. Special Agent Callen,

263
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:49,646
要带你到NCIS的办公室吗
would you like to be taken to the NCIS office?

264
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,130
我先去警卫室
Actually, I'm headed to the brig first,

265
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:52,348
但我找不到了路 谢啦
but can find my way. Thanks.

266
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,767
你肯是Colter先生
You must be Mr. Colter,

267
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:56,653
数据访问分析师
the data entry systems analyst.

268
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:57,987
你说成dayta 我说data
Well, you say "Day-ta," I say data--

269
00:11:57,989 --> 00:11:59,989
我看咱们就统一叫成data
I say we split the difference and call it a date.

270
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:01,974
我是文职人员联络官
I'm the ship's civilian personnel liaison.

271
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:03,326
我是你的随从
I'll be your escort.

272
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:05,745
马上就有人接待你的 女士
Someone should be here to meet you momentarily, ma'am.

273
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:06,812
谢谢
Thank you.

274
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:07,914
好极啦
Fantastic.

275
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:11,817
我不知道你有没有听说过
I don't know if you, uh, overheard that,

276
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:14,170
我有着随从
but I have a, uh, escort.

277
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:16,623
在舰上是不允许亲密接触的 Deeks
Fraternization is forbidden on board, Deeks.

278
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,508
这么大的醋味
Wow, jealous much?

279
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:22,045
Barret少校
Major Barret?

280
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:24,347
不好意思 来晚了
Please excuse my tardiness, ma'am.

281
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:25,665

I'm Lieutenant Abernathy.

282
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:26,832
欢迎
Welcome aboard.

283
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,301
谢谢 上尉
Thank you, Lieutenant.

284
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:30,636
跟我来 我带你到你的住宿点
If you'll follow me, I'll show you to your berthing.

285
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:33,005

You can get squared away before you muster on station. Yes.

287
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:35,525

So what, they found the missing link.

288
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:38,357

Are you coming, Mr. Colter?

289
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,314

Oh. Colter, no. Please call me Marty.

290
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:41,814

And I should call you...?

291
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:43,533

Petty Officer Smalls will suffice, sir.

292
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,452

All right.

293
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:49,572

So, what were you and Staff Sergeant Jefferies fighting about?

294
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:51,874

I don't know, sir. It was stupid.

295
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:54,060

I mean, you know what the Marines are like.

296
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:56,713

"Oorah" This and "Oorah" That.

297
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:58,131

Sometimes it just gets a little tiresome

298
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:59,549

and you have to stand up to them

299
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:01,417

or else they walk around like they own the place.

300
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,670

You two have a history?

301
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:04,754

Absolutely not, sir.

302
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:06,706

I couldn't pick him out of a lineup.

303
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,391

He and his boys were lipping off,

304
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:09,892

so I told them to shut it.

305
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:11,477

Next think you know, he's tackling me.

306
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,646

Guess he figured he had something to prove.

307
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:16,115

Did this fight have anything to do with cocaine?

308
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:18,050

I can't speak for Petty Officer Allen,

309
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:20,853

but I did not, nor have I ever used cocaine.

310
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:22,989

Then how do you explain your drug test?

311
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,774

It must be a mistake, sir.

312
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,659

I'd gladly be retested.

313
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:28,911

Oh, so you test negative now that it's out of your system?

314
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:30,913

It was never in my system, sir.

315
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:32,865

I'm no angel, Agent Callen,

316
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:35,785

but I'll take a lie detector to prove I'm no drug user.

317
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:37,870

My father and my uncle were Marines.

318
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:39,706

I would never disrespect this uniform,

319
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:43,176

this ship or my family by doing something so stupid.

320
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:48,598

What's your relationship with the NCIS Special Agent Afloat

321
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,599

Jason Niles?

322
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:51,884

I never even knew

323
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:54,887

who he was until I heard he was reported dead.

324
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:56,889

Yeah, I-I only met him once.

325
00:13:56,891 --> 00:14:00,359

He intervened in an argument I was having a few days ago.

326
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:01,978

What was the argument about?

327
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,947

It was music. Some E3 was in the library

328
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:06,899

listening to music with his headphones,

329
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:09,986

but he had the tunes cranked so loud, it was bugging everybody.

330
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:11,937

Where were you yesterday

331
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:15,541

prior to the... altercation in the galley?

332
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:17,493

Fire safety drills.

333
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:19,278

I had the morning watch.

334
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,963

Which ends at 8:00? Yes, sir.

335
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:22,799

The fight took place just after 9:00,

336
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,117

so what were you doing for the hour in-between?

337
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:27,170

Uh, usually I would jog around the deck,

338
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:29,088

but flight operations were in full swing,

339
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,224

so I just walked below deck.

340
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:34,560

Uh-huh. Why didn't you use the treadmills in the gym?

341
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:38,648

I always feel like a hamster on those things, sir.

342
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,066

Anyone see you?

343
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:41,851

Uh, yeah, sure, lots of people.

344
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:44,987

Anyone see you around the... zero-two-tack-

345
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:48,274

one-eight-two-tack- six-tango section of the ship?

346
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:50,409

I-I can't be sure, sir.

347
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,645

Where exactly is that?

348
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:57,583

Where the body was found.

349
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:02,839

The bull's-eyes tell you where you are

350
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,458

Deck, frame, relation to centerline and compartment.

351
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,293

Numbers increase as you go aft.

352
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:09,595

Even numbers are port, odd numbers are starboard.

353
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:12,131

Starbucks? S-Starboard.

354
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:14,333

No, I mean, is there a Starbucks on board?

355
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:16,552

Or a Coffee Bean?

356
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:18,371

Panda Express? T.G.I. Fridays?

357
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:19,722

Froyo?

358
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,224

Enlisted Mess is

359
00:15:21,226 --> 00:15:22,441

on the second level.

360
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,510

The Dirty Shirt Room, Wardroom One, is forward

361
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:25,895

on the O3 level.

362
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:27,730

Chief's Mess has the best food,

363
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:29,365

but you have to be invited.

364
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:31,951

If you'll follow me this way, Mr. Colter...

365
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:34,687

Mr. Colter? Hello?

366
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,321

What's up there, sailors?

367
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:11,157

Nothing to see here.

368
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:19,999

What the... what?

369
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:30,843

What the hell are you doing? Me? No. I was just...

370
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,461

I was just looking for the bathroom.

371
00:16:32,463 --> 00:16:34,297

I got lost coming around one of these corners.

372
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:35,965

I found myself in the basement of the Titanic.

373
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,600

Seriously, I think I just saw Kate Winslet.

374
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:40,219

She was naked. You should check it... out.

375
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:42,605

Hey, I see how this is--

376
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:44,473

you guys, uh, want to haze the swabbie.

377
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:45,303

Here's the problem--

378
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:47,277

I'm a private contractor, which means you can't

379
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:49,278

dress me up like a sea hag, or whatever it is

380
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,230

you and your seaman buddy here do for fun.

381
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:00,940

What the hell is going on in here?

382
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:05,244

He was creeping around where we found that NCIS agent dead, sir.

383
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,797

Sir, you know what they say about criminals,

384
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,582

always returning to the scene of the crime.

385
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:10,583

Yeah, except for Matlock,

386
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:12,498

I'm pretty sure no one actually says that.

387
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:18,123

I'll take him from here.

388
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:26,565

They're gone.

389
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,935

I just need... Come on, Deeks,

390
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:30,903

pull your skirt down-- I hardly hit you.

391
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:34,407

I know, I was... I was just in character.

392
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:35,741

It's fine. I'm fine.

393
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,077

You've been on the ship less than an hour,

394
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,363

and you're already in trouble. Yeah, I know,

395
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:41,781

but I found evidence.

396
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:43,032

Special Agent Niles

397
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:45,418

was killed on a different part of the ship,

398
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,620

and then his body was dragged here.

399
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:06,275

These are the sailors who attacked Deeks.

400
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:09,161

Both men have had minor incidents while on shore leave,
