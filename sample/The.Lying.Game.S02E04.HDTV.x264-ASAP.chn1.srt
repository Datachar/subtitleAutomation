×ÖÄ»
A few months ago, I discovered I had a twin sister.

2
00:00:03,353 --> 00:00:05,823
×ÖÄ»
And then she she asked me to take her place,

3
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:08,046
×ÖÄ»
keep the secret, find our real mother

4
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:10,270
×ÖÄ»
and try to stay alive.

5
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:12,217
×ÖÄ»
Put yourself in my shoes.

6
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,835
×ÖÄ»
How long could you keep up the lying game?

7
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:15,998
×Ö
Not interested. 

8
00:00:15,998 --> 00:00:17,107
Ä»
Oh, is that right?

9
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:22,422
×ÖÄ»
You u ididt , so I slept with him.

10
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,282
×ÖÄ»
It was a mistake, Sutton.

11
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:26,619
×ÖÄ»
Ted, about the therapy session on Monday,

12
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:27,599
×ÖÄ»
I'll be there.

13
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:29,719
×ÖÄ»
I'm so happy for you.

14
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:30,766
×ÖÄ»
What's going on here?

15
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:32,983
×ÖÄ»
I was just thanking her for tutoring me. 

16
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:33,974
×ÖÄ»
You know what?

17
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:35,576
×ÖÄ»
It doesn't matter.

18
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,054
×ÖÄ»
Care to make things interesting?

19
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:38,106
×ÖÄ»
You want to switch back?

20
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:40,852
×ÖÄ»
Whoever loses has to stay in the cabin.

21
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:43,270
×ÖÄ»
That phone I found exonerated him. I can't beat him. 

22
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,109
×ÖÄ»
The only mistake I made was taking your bastard ass in.

23
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:46,868
×ÖÄ»
Hey, hey!

24
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:48,774
×ÖÄ»
There is nothing left for me here anymore.

25
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:49,674
×ÖÄ»
What about me?

26
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,451
×ÖÄ»
Tough break, but a deal's a deal.

27
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,246
×ÖÄ»
I left some clean towels for you at the cabin.

28
00:00:53,246 --> 00:00:57,782
×ÖÄ»
I've gotten the feeling that he might blame me for his arrest.

29
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,371
×ÖÄ»
Hey, baby, I'm home.

30
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,538
×ÖÄ»
Good morning, sunshine.

31
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,921
×ÖÄ»
Uh, what are you doing?

32
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:21,273
×ÖÄ»
Just watching you sleep.

33
00:01:21,273 --> 00:01:22,135
×ÖÄ»
I missed that.

34
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:23,499
×ÖÄ»
Well, isn't that romantic?

35
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:25,209
×ÖÄ»
I've been in prison for a while.

36
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:28,163
×ÖÄ»
I can't believe I'm actually here with you.

37
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:36,795
×ÖÄ»
Was it worth the wait?

38
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:37,776
×ÖÄ»
You tell me.

39
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:41,754
×ÖÄ»
So, your first day as a free man.

40
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:43,365
×ÖÄ»
What are your plans?

41
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:47,016
×ÖÄ»
I was thinking maybe we could take that

42
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:49,507
×ÖÄ»
honeymoon we've been putting off.

43
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:53,358
×ÖÄ»
Oh, well, that sounds great, but...

44
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:56,826
×ÖÄ»
where are we gonna go on such short notice?

45
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,856
×ÖÄ»
As it turns out, I got a little spot I know about.

46
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:00,679
×ÖÄ»
A little bed and breakfast? Hmm.

47
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:02,428
×ÖÄ»
A five-star resort and spa?

48
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:03,382
×ÖÄ»
Ah, now, it wouldn't be a surprise

49
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:04,283
×ÖÄ»
if I told you, would it?

50
00:02:04,283 --> 00:02:07,325
×ÖÄ»
Oh, well, come on, just a little hint.

51
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,419
×ÖÄ»
Please tell me.

52
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,210
×ÖÄ»
Let's just say that this weekend

53
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:18,352
×ÖÄ»
my bride finally gets everything she deserves.

54
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,164
×ÖÄ»
It's Thayer.

55
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:39,134
×ÖÄ»
You know what to do.

56
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:41,704
×ÖÄ»
Hey, it's me again. 

57
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,664
Ä»
I tried your cell and you didn't answer, 

58
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,147
×Ö
so I'm trying you here. 

59
00:02:45,972 --> 00:02:47,389
×ÖÄ»
I just want to know that you're okay. 

60
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:49,038
×ÖÄ»
I hate the way we left things.

61
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:50,080
×ÖÄ»
Please call me.

62
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:57,522
×ÖÄ»
Thayer?

63
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:58,907
×ÖÄ»
Nope, it's me.

64
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:01,503
×ÖÄ»
I wanted to see how your night at the cabin was.

65
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:02,885
×ÖÄ»
You're checking on me?

66
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,057
×ÖÄ»
Well, of course, you're my sister.

67
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:07,946
×ÖÄ»
Plus, I know how lonely it can get there.

68
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,828
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

69
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:12,307
×ÖÄ»
But it's just for a few days, right?

70
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:14,620
×ÖÄ»
We're switching back after tennis regionals.

71
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,669
×ÖÄ»
That was the deal.

72
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:18,450
×ÖÄ»
Anyway, I'm calling

73
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,267
×ÖÄ»
because I wanted to make sure you're not mad at me 

74
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:24,513
×Ö
for what I told you 

75
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:27,874
Ä»
the other day about, you know.

76
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,135
×ÖÄ»
About you sleeping with Ethan?

77
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:30,887
×ÖÄ»
I told you, it's fine.

78
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:31,679
×ÖÄ»
Really?

79
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,993
×ÖÄ»
Yes, sleep with whomever you want. 

80
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:36,425
×ÖÄ»
Just promise me you won't do anything

81
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,296
×ÖÄ»
to rock the boat with Ted and Kristin.

82
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:39,073
×ÖÄ»
If you haven't noticed,

83
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:40,759
×ÖÄ»
They're getting along better now. 

84
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,971
×ÖÄ»
I get it, Emma.

85
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,379
×ÖÄ»
You have my word.

86
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:47,071
×ÖÄ»
And, in fact, I think you'll find that 

87
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:51,100
×Ö
I am going to be a sweeter, nicer version of myself 

88
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,084
Ä»
than you.

89
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:54,552
×ÖÄ»
Do you have a sec?

90
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:56,311
×ÖÄ»
You have nothing to worry about. I have to go. 

91
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:58,144
×ÖÄ»
What's up?

92
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:01,097
×ÖÄ»
I wanted to talk to you about what happened last night.

93
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:02,320
×ÖÄ»
What happened last night?

94
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:05,315
×ÖÄ»
When I saw Jordan kissing Mads outside?

95
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:07,555
×ÖÄ»
Oh, right, yeah, that...

96
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:08,735
×ÖÄ»
That was rough.

97
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,456
×ÖÄ»
I thought things were going so well between me and Jordan,

98
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:14,433
×ÖÄ»
and then Mads just totally goes behind my back...

99
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,726
×ÖÄ»
Okay, look, Laurel.

100
00:04:15,749 --> 00:04:17,119
×ÖÄ»
What you need to remember

101
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:20,590
×ÖÄ»
is that Jordan Lyle is a worldly,

102
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:24,635
×ÖÄ»
older, dangerously sexy guy

103
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,488
×ÖÄ»
who, let's face it,

104
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,079
×ÖÄ»
is way out of your league.

105
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:35,646
×ÖÄ»
If I remember correctly, uh, the other day,

106
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:37,755
×ÖÄ»
you said he'd be lucky to have me.

107
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:39,978
×ÖÄ»
And clearly you blew it,

108
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:43,149
×ÖÄ»
so I think you should move on.

109
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:47,796
×ÖÄ»
I mean, go for some lower hanging fruit like a sophomore.

110
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:50,134
×ÖÄ»
Or one of those guys in the clubs

111
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:51,756
×ÖÄ»
in the back of the yearbook.

112
00:04:55,148 --> 00:04:56,440
×ÖÄ»
I-I don't get it.

113
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:58,712
×ÖÄ»
I know, I know.

114
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:01,805
×ÖÄ»
Love-- it's very confusing.

115
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,374
×ÖÄ»
I'm hungry for breakfast, though.

116
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:06,513
×ÖÄ»
I'm thinking tofu scramble?

10117
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:29,649
aaaa

118
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:33,580
aaa

119
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,916
×ÖÄ»
What are you doing here?

120
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,120
×ÖÄ»
Hi, kiddo. Your father has some news.

121
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:38,023
×ÖÄ»
What is it?

122
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:40,402
×ÖÄ»
Well, remember all that pro bono work I was doing

123
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:42,182
×ÖÄ»
at the burn clinic last summer?

124
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:44,092
×ÖÄ»
Turns out i was just named

125
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:47,097
×ÖÄ»
Phoenix Surgical Humanitarian of the Year.

126
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,401
×ÖÄ»
That's awesome.

127
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,332
×ÖÄ»
Is there, like, some kind of ceremony or something?

128
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:52,154
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, the banquet's tomorrow.

129
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,751
×ÖÄ»
Originally I was gonna go myself,

130
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:55,433
×ÖÄ»
but then, since they're giving me this award,

131
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:57,170
×ÖÄ»
I was kind of hoping...

132
00:05:57,248 --> 00:05:58,771
×ÖÄ»
Well, of course, we'll be there.

133
00:05:58,771 --> 00:05:59,492
×ÖÄ»
There's one more thing.

134
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,379
×ÖÄ»
They usually ask the recipient's significant 

135
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:06,058
×ÖÄ»
other to say a few words before the presentation.

136
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:08,491
×ÖÄ»
So I guess the committee doesn't know about our situation?

137
00:06:08,491 --> 00:06:09,465
×ÖÄ»
Actually, I was going to mention it,

138
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:10,488
×ÖÄ»
but then I thought things were going

139
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:12,458
×ÖÄ»
pretty well between us, so...

140
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,405
×ÖÄ»
I know it's a lot to spring on you.

141
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:20,486
×ÖÄ»
Maybe we can discuss it during family therapy tomorrow.

142
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:21,479
×ÖÄ»
Maybe.

143
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:23,508
×ÖÄ»
Great. I'll see you then.

144
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,515
×ÖÄ»
Bye.

145
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:26,466
×ÖÄ»
Bye, Dad.

146
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,679
×ÖÄ»
Bye, hon.

147
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:28,750
×ÖÄ»
Bye.

148
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,027
×ÖÄ»
Well, that was awkward.

149
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:35,771
×ÖÄ»
We are going, right, Mom?

150
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,079
×ÖÄ»
Of course, of course.

151
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,365
×ÖÄ»
But, I mean, for me to be giving a speech is...

152
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,828
×ÖÄ»
Mom, please, it would mean so much to him.

153
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:43,663
×ÖÄ»
And you guys have been doing better.

154
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:44,407
×ÖÄ»
Well, yes, in the sense

155
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,852
×ÖÄ»
that we can be in the same room without fighting.

156
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:49,244
×ÖÄ»
But for me to stand up in front of an audience

157
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:50,952
×ÖÄ»
and pretend that we're a happy couple...

158
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,748
×ÖÄ»
No, why don't Laurel and I do it?

159
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:55,466
×ÖÄ»
Really?

160
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,485
×ÖÄ»
I mean, sure, yeah, we can do it.

161
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,919
×ÖÄ»
Sweetie, it's short notice.

162
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,200
×ÖÄ»
Do you have time to prepare a speech?

163
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:04,463
×ÖÄ»
For a bunch of nerdy doctors? Yeah.

164
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:07,797
×ÖÄ»
Plus, I already know what I'm going to say.

165
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:13,202
×ÖÄ»
Mads, I wasn't expecting you.

166
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:15,241
×ÖÄ»
Uh, because I'm not here to see you.

167
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:16,752
×ÖÄ»
Hey, is this about last night?

168
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:18,600
×ÖÄ»
'Cause until Laurel had her little meltdown,

169
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,567
×ÖÄ»
you and I were getting pretty hot and...

170
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,428
×ÖÄ»
I'm not here to discuss that.

171
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,930
×ÖÄ»
Okay, why are you here?

172
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,890

Maddie?

Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

176
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:31,082

Mr. Rybak,

179
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:34,917
×ÖÄ»
we didn't get a chance to meet last night.

180
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:35,747
×ÖÄ»
I'm Jordan Lyle. 

181

Jordan. Rebecca's stepson. Yes, sir.

182
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:39,508

You can call me Alec. All right.

183
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,893
×ÖÄ»
I see you two have already met? Barely.

184
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:43,834
×ÖÄ»
We've bumped into each other a couple times, yeah.

185
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:47,272
×ÖÄ»
Hmm, well, glad you're acquainted.

186
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,517
×ÖÄ»
Maddie, since I've moved in here with Rebecca,

187
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:51,753
×ÖÄ»
I was kind of hoping you might think about doing the same.

188
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:52,767
×ÖÄ»
Really?

189
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:55,240
×ÖÄ»
That's an interesting idea, sir.

190
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:57,125
×ÖÄ»
We'll see.

191
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,442
×ÖÄ»
It's good to see that everybody's getting to know each other.

192
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:02,212
×ÖÄ»
Honey, did you tell them about our honeymoon plans?

193
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:03,290
×ÖÄ»
Honeymoon?

194
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,212
×ÖÄ»
Um, yeah...

195
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:07,398
×ÖÄ»
Sutton?

196
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:08,642
×ÖÄ»
What are you doing here?

197
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,354
×ÖÄ»
Well, the door was open, so...

198
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:12,588
×ÖÄ»
So you just walked in?

199
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:16,703
×ÖÄ»
Well, my godfather is back and

200
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:18,462
×ÖÄ»
I was just so excited to see him.

201
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:21,590
×ÖÄ»
Well, you're kind of interrupting a family moment.

202
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:24,499
×ÖÄ»
So let me show you out.

203
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:29,592
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I'm sorry.

204
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,736
×ÖÄ»
I didn't realize I was walking

205
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:33,523
×ÖÄ»
into the Bizarro family reunion back there.

206
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,764
×ÖÄ»
Why are you freaking out?

207
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:37,665
×ÖÄ»
I'm not freaking out.

208
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:38,895
×ÖÄ»
You were being careless.

209
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:40,879
×ÖÄ»
Fine, I screwed up, but I'm just really excited to tell you

210
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,816
×Ö
what happened this morning. 

211
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:42,750
Ä»
What?

212
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,356
×ÖÄ»
My dad's getting this award...

213
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,272
×ÖÄ»
What award?

214
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:47,281
×ÖÄ»
I don't know. I wasn't really listening.

215
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,393
×ÖÄ»
Maybe for giving homeless people free boob jobs or something?

216
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:52,131
×ÖÄ»
Anyway,

217
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,556
×ÖÄ»
he asked Kristin to introduce him at the ceremony.

218
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:55,709
×ÖÄ»
She said no.

219
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:57,408
×ÖÄ»
Guess who offered to speak instead.

220
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:58,484
×Ö
Excellent. 

221
00:08:58,484 --> 00:09:00,277

Mm-hmm, and get this:

222
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:01,908
×ÖÄ»
we're going to family therapy. Mm-hmm.

223
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,884
×ÖÄ»
And don't worry, I already know what I'm going to say.

224
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:06,595
×ÖÄ»
Okay, even so, I want you to run it by me first.

225
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:08,298
×ÖÄ»
Our plan is moving to the next phase,

226
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,953
×ÖÄ»
and I don't want to leave anything to chance.

227
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:13,631
×ÖÄ»
Call me later.

228
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:15,974
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

229
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:27,922
×ÖÄ»
Look, if you want to take a break, we...

230
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:29,377
×ÖÄ»
No, let's just keep going.

231
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:31,422
×ÖÄ»
We have a ton of chemistry to do left.

232
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:32,301
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

233
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,303
×ÖÄ»
Emma, I just want you to know that I, 

234
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,853
×ÖÄ»
I appreciate you still tutoring me.

235
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:43,362
×ÖÄ»
'Cause I know you're probably going through 

236
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:45,744
×ÖÄ»
a lot with Thayer leaving.

237
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,349
×ÖÄ»
Ethan, let's not do this.

238
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:49,698
×ÖÄ»
What?

239
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:52,212
×ÖÄ»
I'm-I'm just trying to be a friend here.

240
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:54,623
×ÖÄ»
You're not my friend.

241
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:57,815
×ÖÄ»
And I may be helping you study here, but I don't want to discuss 

242
00:09:57,815 --> 00:09:59,267
×ÖÄ»
Thayer any more than I want to talk about 

243
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,921
×ÖÄ»
what happened with you and Sutton.

244
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:05,114
×ÖÄ»
Of course.

245
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:10,730
×ÖÄ»
She told you that we slept together after Jordan's party.

246
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:12,967
×ÖÄ»
It's not my business.

247
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:14,802
×ÖÄ»
Then, why are you acting like it is?

248
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:19,563
×ÖÄ»
Because I used to think you were better than that.

249
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,655
×ÖÄ»
What are they doing here?

250
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:35,983
×ÖÄ»
Oh, crap.

251
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:43,030
×ÖÄ»
Alec, I know you wanted to surprise me, but this place?

252
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,549
×ÖÄ»
What are we, hillbillies?

253
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,078
×Ö
Hurry, grab everything. They can't know we were here. 

254
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,247
Ä»
All right.

255
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,763
×Ö
Is this yours? 

256
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:52,102
Ä»
Doesn't matter, just take it.

257
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:55,334
×ÖÄ»
Damn it.

258
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:57,804
×ÖÄ»
Hang on, uh, here, give me a towel, quick.

259
00:10:58,402 --> 00:10:59,487

Here, take this.

260
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:01,785

×ÖÄ»
Got it. Got it.

263
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:18,361
×ÖÄ»
What?

264
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:21,046
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:23,227
×ÖÄ»
I'm a little rusty.

266
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:24,996
×ÖÄ»
Oh. Come here.

267
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:27,016
×ÖÄ»
I had no idea you were so old-fashioned.

268
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:29,282
×ÖÄ»
Oh, well, there's more surprises where that came from.

269
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:30,362
×ÖÄ»
That sounds good.

270
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:32,944
×ÖÄ»
Look, flat screen.

271
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,743
×ÖÄ»
: Are they on their honeymoon?

272
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,238
×ÖÄ»
I guess.

273
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:38,603
×ÖÄ»
Oh, my God, what if they start getting naked?

274
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:42,132
×ÖÄ»
Ted bought this place when they were still in diapers.

275
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:44,690
×ÖÄ»
Now you couldn't pay 'em to come up here.

{\an8}Ó²×ÖÄ»

277

Oh, well, I'm sure i will come to love it.

278
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,720
×ÖÄ»
After all, you brought me up here for some reason.

279
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:57,585
×ÖÄ»
I'm sure I'll figure out what that is.

280
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:02,587
×ÖÄ»
Why don't I give you the grand tour? 

281
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:06,554
×ÖÄ»
She saw us.

282
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:07,291
×ÖÄ»
No, she didn't.

00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,095

Yes, she did. She looked right at me.

284
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:12,267
×ÖÄ»
Wait, w-wait, slow down, cowboy.

285
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:14,935

I'm not done with you in this room.

286
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,216

We have to go.

Laurel, come on, I want to apologize

for last night, all right? I...

290
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:27,001
×ÖÄ»
I don't want it to be weird between us.

291
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,449
×ÖÄ»
Hmm, think it's late for that, don't you?

292
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,734
×ÖÄ»
Well, it doesn't have to be.

293
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:32,047
×ÖÄ»
When you invited me to the club the other night,

294
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:34,614
×ÖÄ»
I didn't know that was a date. All right, that's my bad.

295
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:36,955
×ÖÄ»
Look, you're very pretty, all right?

296
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:42,172
×ÖÄ»
I'm pretty?

297
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:43,128
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

298
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:46,343
×ÖÄ»
Okay, look, Jordan, any misguided feelings

299
00:12:46,343 --> 00:12:49,373
×ÖÄ»
I might have briefly had for you are definitely over,

×ÖÄ»
so you can save your patronizing compliments.

301
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:53,383
×ÖÄ»
That's fair enough.

302
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,045
×ÖÄ»
Anything else?

303
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:58,206
×ÖÄ»
All right, let me tell you what.

304
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,431

and you can yell at me all you want.

306
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:03,915

What do you say?

307
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:04,936

×ÖÄ»
Yeah, Alec honeymooning at the cabin.

311
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:38,661
×ÖÄ»
I kind of figured him for a Turks and Caicos kind of guy.

312
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,722
×ÖÄ»
You gonna be okay here?

313
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:40,699
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

314
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:43,237

×ÖÄ»
when her car went into the lake.

316
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:48,017

×ÖÄ»
No. I'm fine. Thanks.

318
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:55,584
×ÖÄ»
So this means tutoring is out, I guess?

319
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:57,685
×ÖÄ»
No.

320
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:01,486
×ÖÄ»
Believe it or not, I don't want to see you go back to juvie.

321
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:02,692
×ÖÄ»
So...

322
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:06,057
×ÖÄ»
Just meet me back here later.

323
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:08,018
×ÖÄ»
We'll finish our session.

324
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:12,077
×ÖÄ»
Hey.

325
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:13,154
×ÖÄ»
Emma?

326
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:15,638
×ÖÄ»
Thanks.

327
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,196
×ÖÄ»
Hi, I need a room, please.

328
00:14:28,973 --> 00:14:30,061
×ÖÄ»
It's you.

329
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:31,071
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry?

330
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:33,954
×ÖÄ»
You owe me money.

331
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:38,617
×ÖÄ»
I do owe you money

332
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:40,659
×ÖÄ»
from the last time I was here.

333
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,405
×ÖÄ»
What was the bill again?

334
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:44,391
×ÖÄ»
You know, this isn't about the bill.

335
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:45,754
×ÖÄ»
I did you a favor.

336
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,656
×ÖÄ»
When that guy came in asking questions,

337
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:50,692
×ÖÄ»
you paid me to lie and say you were in that room alone.

338
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:53,088
×ÖÄ»
Right.

339
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:54,783
×ÖÄ»
Alone, well, I...

340
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:56,815
×ÖÄ»
I was with that woman.

341
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:58,413
×ÖÄ»
That woman. You mean women.

342
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:00,287
×ÖÄ»
What? Wow.

343
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:03,171
×ÖÄ»
You really did take a knock on the head that night.

344
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:07,126
×ÖÄ»
Girly, there were two women with you in that room.

345
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:07,789
×ÖÄ»
Two women? Yeah, two.

346
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:10,370
×ÖÄ»
So, where's my 80 bucks?

347
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:23,278
×ÖÄ»
I got to say, this crappy motel room

348
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,523
×ÖÄ»
isn't exactly the ideal place for studying Faulkner.

349
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:27,788
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

350
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,589
×ÖÄ»
Maybe if we talk louder,

351
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,497
×ÖÄ»
the hookers next door will learn something.

352
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:36,136
×ÖÄ»
Hey, maybe that's them now.

353
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:43,195
×ÖÄ»
Sutton, what are you doing here?

354
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:44,671
×ÖÄ»
What does it look like I'm doing here?

355
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:48,487
×ÖÄ»
Ethan gave me a little hint about your cram session.

356
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:51,070
×ÖÄ»
So I thought I'd hit the books.

357
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:52,093
×ÖÄ»
Really?

358
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:54,755
×ÖÄ»
You're here to study?

359
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,470
×ÖÄ»
Well, yeah, thanks to you,

360
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,443
×ÖÄ»
Sutton Mercer has a hefty GPA to maintain, so...

361
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:05,551
×ÖÄ»
And studying is all that's going on here, right?

362
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:06,838
×ÖÄ»
What do you think?

363
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,166
×ÖÄ»
Anyway, you know,

364
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,740
×ÖÄ»
I figured you'd be pretty busy working on your speech.

365
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:13,517
×ÖÄ»
What speech?

366
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:14,448
×ÖÄ»
Oh, it's nothing.

367
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:16,833
×ÖÄ»
Just some stupid awards thing for my dad.

368
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,760
×ÖÄ»
Being here brings back so many memories, 

369
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,982
×ÖÄ»
which is surprising,

370
00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:26,144
×ÖÄ»
considering I had a head wound last time I was here.

371
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:27,501
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, funny you should say that,

372
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,473
×ÖÄ»
because when I was checking in,

373
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:32,215
×ÖÄ»
the desk clerk said something kind of weird to me.

374
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,055
×ÖÄ»
Well, he's weird.

375
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:35,751
×ÖÄ»
What did he say?

376
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,774
×ÖÄ»
He said that when you were here,

377
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,709
×ÖÄ»
Annie wasn't the only person with you.

378
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:43,417
×ÖÄ»
Someone else was here.

379
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,647
×ÖÄ»
Did he now?

380
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:50,073
×ÖÄ»
Well, he was so busy hitting on me that night

381
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:53,578
×ÖÄ»
that he couldn't have possibly noticed who I was with.

382
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,140
×ÖÄ»
Who did he think he saw?

383
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:00,661
×ÖÄ»
He didn't say.

384
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:03,832
×ÖÄ»
But anyway, you're right.

385
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:04,957
×ÖÄ»
He...

386
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:06,461
×ÖÄ»
creeped me out, too.

387
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:11,612
×ÖÄ»
This is nice.

388
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:13,540
×ÖÄ»
Cloth napkins,

389
00:17:14,695 --> 00:17:16,120
×ÖÄ»
candlelight.

390
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:19,336
×ÖÄ»
Le poulet en croute.

391
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:20,458
×ÖÄ»
It's from Celine,

392
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,170
×ÖÄ»
your favorite spot.

393
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:25,564
×ÖÄ»
Well, you really did think of everything.

394
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,760
×ÖÄ»
It's a very special wine.

395
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:30,945
×ÖÄ»
I've been saving it for a very special occasion.

396
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:35,662
×ÖÄ»
I think tonight might just be that night.

397
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:45,170
×ÖÄ»
Let's celebrate like tonight

398
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:48,078
×ÖÄ»
is our last night on Earth.

399
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:55,981
×ÖÄ»
You know, one of the things we never talked about 

400
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:57,810
×ÖÄ»
is what you did the whole time I was gone. 

401
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,445
×ÖÄ»
I mean, that must have been tough for you, 

402
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,000
×ÖÄ»
having your new husband locked up.

403
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,153
×ÖÄ»
It was.

404
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:06,136
×ÖÄ»
They were the hardest days of my life.

405
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:07,006
×ÖÄ»
I'll bet.

406
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:09,201
×ÖÄ»
Did you ever wonder if I was ever getting out of there?

407
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:10,558
×ÖÄ»
Now, why would I?

408
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:13,141
×ÖÄ»
You're an innocent man.

409
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:15,692
×ÖÄ»
I have faith in the system.

410
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:19,071
×ÖÄ»
Although there was this one moment.

411
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:21,581
×ÖÄ»
Oh, it's nothing.

412
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:23,922
×ÖÄ»
We were both under a lot of stress.

413
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:27,877
×ÖÄ»
There was this one time that I went to see you in jail,

414
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:30,700
×ÖÄ»
and... I...

415
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:33,627
×ÖÄ»
could have thought that you...

416
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:36,613
×ÖÄ»
thought that I was somehow...

417
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:40,233
×ÖÄ»
...behind framing you for Derek's murder.

418
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:41,751
×ÖÄ»
That's crazy talk.

419
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:45,332
×ÖÄ»
And we both know you were my rock,

420
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,803
×ÖÄ»
you know, through the whole thing.

421
00:18:46,803 --> 00:18:47,481
×Ö
Of course. 

422
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:51,634
Ä» ×ÖÄ»
Plus, if I thought you were framing me about anything,

423
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:53,689
×Ö
I don't think we'd be sitting here 

424
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:55,843
Ä»
drinking an $800 bottle of wine.

425
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,001
×ÖÄ»
I'd be outside, burying you in the woods.

426
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,297
×ÖÄ»
Not if I buried you first.

427
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:07,840
×ÖÄ»
TouchÃ©.

428
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:19,804
×ÖÄ»
Hey, girlie, hold up.

429
00:19:21,556 --> 00:19:22,258
×ÖÄ»
Can I help you?

430
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:24,147
×ÖÄ»
Actually, I was thinking I could help you.

431
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:26,203
×ÖÄ»
You know how earlier you couldn't remember

432
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:28,905
×ÖÄ»
how there were two ladies with you that night you were here?

433
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:32,368
×ÖÄ»
Yes.

434
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,330
×ÖÄ»
My mind was blank, but yes.

435
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,868
×ÖÄ»
So, to jog your memory,

436
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:40,018
×ÖÄ»
I, uh, put together a couple sketches of the women you were with.

437
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:45,029
×ÖÄ»
So what do you think?

10438
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,430
×ÖÄ»
I think you're a very talented artist, Carl.

439
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,671
×ÖÄ»
Correct me if I'm wrong,

440
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:09,660
×ÖÄ»
but wasn't our deal that, if I won our tennis match,

441
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:11,904
×ÖÄ»
you stay hidden until after regionals?

442
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:15,514
×ÖÄ»
Actually, the deal was that I stay in the cabin,

443
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,446
×ÖÄ»
which is now full of middle-aged honeymooners.

444
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:19,447
×ÖÄ»
Here.

445
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:21,455
×ÖÄ»
What is this?

446
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,449
×ÖÄ»
It's a speech.

447
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:25,602
×ÖÄ»
I was thinking about Ted's awards banquet,

448
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:27,611
×ÖÄ»
and I just thought I'd help.

449
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:29,249
×ÖÄ»
That's really sweet of you, Emma,

450
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:31,115
×ÖÄ»
but I have it covered. Thank you.

451
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:32,343
×ÖÄ»
Are you sure?

452
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:35,071
×ÖÄ»
Because this is huge, Sutton.

453
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:37,128
×ÖÄ»
I mean, the family is going to be together,

454
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:39,750
×ÖÄ»
and Ted and Kristin are in such a precarious place.

455
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,613
×ÖÄ»
I said no.

456
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,653
×ÖÄ»
LAUREL: Sutton?

457
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:49,018
×ÖÄ»
Laurel, wait!

458
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,834
×ÖÄ»
What's going on?

459
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:52,570
×ÖÄ»
Look who finally decided

460
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,072
×ÖÄ»
to do her hair today.

461
00:20:54,635 --> 00:20:56,250
×ÖÄ»
What are you doing? What do you want?

462
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,693
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I can't believe I'm actually about to say this,

463
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:01,775
×ÖÄ»
but I wanted to thank you

464
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:03,836
×ÖÄ»
for the advice you gave me about Jordan.

465
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:05,147
×ÖÄ»
Seriously?

466
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:07,556
×ÖÄ»
Yeah. I mean, I don't buy

467
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:09,334
×ÖÄ»
the whole out-of-my-league thing,

468
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,188
×ÖÄ»
but you were right about him being wrong for me.

469
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,784
×ÖÄ»
Well, you're welcome.

470
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:15,568
×ÖÄ»
I'll show you to...

471
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:18,143
×ÖÄ»
Actually, no. Uh, so,

472
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,976
×ÖÄ»
after I told off Jordan,

473
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:22,023
×ÖÄ»
which was incredibly fun, by the way,

474
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:24,708
×ÖÄ»
I got to wondering.

475
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:28,417
×ÖÄ»
What's wrong with us?

476
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:30,574
×ÖÄ»
Why do the Mercer sisters

477
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:32,638
×ÖÄ»
keep picking the wrong guys?

478
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:35,407
×ÖÄ»
Justin, Jordan, Ethan?

479
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:37,774
×ÖÄ»
Is this you giving me love advice?

480
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:39,175
×ÖÄ»
I'm just asking.

481
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:43,221
×ÖÄ»
Why are you wasting your time tutoring Ethan, the guy

482
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:45,620
×ÖÄ»
who broke your heart, when you have someone like Thayer?

483
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,815
×ÖÄ»
Oh, yeah, Thayer.

484
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:51,063
×ÖÄ»
Of course, he's just so sweet and kind

485
00:21:51,063 --> 00:21:53,435
×ÖÄ»
and loyal as a puppy dog.

486
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:55,839
×ÖÄ»
You say that like it's a bad thing.

487
00:21:57,658 --> 00:21:59,327
×ÖÄ»
He cares about you.

488
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:02,569
×ÖÄ»
And for a while there,

489
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:04,671
×ÖÄ»
I thought you cared about him, too.

490
00:22:16,473 --> 00:22:17,426
×ÖÄ»
Damn it!

491
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,793
×ÖÄ»
Alec? Alec?!

492
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:27,937
×ÖÄ»
What happened to the power?

493
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:32,609
×ÖÄ»
Alec? Are you there?

494
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,546
×ÖÄ»
Alec, where are you?

495
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,801
×ÖÄ»
Alec?

496
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:01,517
×ÖÄ»
Is this a joke?

497
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:39,621
×ÖÄ»
That was quite a spill you took.

498
00:23:42,474 --> 00:23:43,655
×ÖÄ»
Get away.

499
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,106
×ÖÄ»
You did that on purpose.

500
00:23:46,106 --> 00:23:48,107
×ÖÄ»
What? I know what you're doing.

501
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,985
×ÖÄ»
This whole honeymoon,

502
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:53,693
×ÖÄ»
the little looks, the cryptic comments.

503
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:55,997
×ÖÄ»
You're, you're screwing with my head!

504
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:57,663
×ÖÄ»
I know those lights

505
00:23:57,663 --> 00:23:59,248
×ÖÄ»
didn't go off by themselves.

506
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:01,508
×ÖÄ»
Yes, they did. That's exactly what happened, honey.

507
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,258
×ÖÄ»
I went outside to check the breakers,

508
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:04,296
×ÖÄ»
and the box was locked.

509
00:24:04,296 --> 00:24:05,846
×ÖÄ»
I had to come back in and get the key.

510
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:08,795
×ÖÄ»
I changed it. You're lying.

511
00:24:09,443 --> 00:24:11,697
×ÖÄ»
Why don't you just cut this whole loving husband act

512
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:13,940
×ÖÄ»
and tell me why you brought me up here?

513
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,050
×ÖÄ»
Do you really think I framed you?

514
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,686
×ÖÄ»
Sweetheart, we've been through this.

515
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:22,262
×ÖÄ»
If I still thought that, then where are the divorce papers?

516
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:25,087
×ÖÄ»
What are we doing up here on our honeymoon?

517
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:26,886
×ÖÄ»
Why would I move into your house and ask

518
00:24:26,886 --> 00:24:29,559
×ÖÄ»
my daughter to do the exact same thing?

519
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:34,259
×ÖÄ»
How could I possibly make love to you?

520
00:24:35,902 --> 00:24:38,923
×ÖÄ»
Sweetheart, if I thought you betrayed me

521
00:24:38,923 --> 00:24:40,855
×ÖÄ»
and yet did all those things,

522
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,979
×ÖÄ»
what kind of man would that make me?

523
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:46,987
×ÖÄ»
Come here.

524
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:21,316
×ÖÄ»
Why do I get the feeling you're not just running late?

525
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,313
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry.

526
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,494
×ÖÄ»
I would have called earlier,

527
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:26,662
×ÖÄ»
but something really important came up.

528
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:28,144
×ÖÄ»
Sound like you're on the road.

529
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:33,859
×ÖÄ»
I'm on a bus... to L.A.

530
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:37,600
×ÖÄ»
Of course you are.

531
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:40,039
×ÖÄ»
I care about him, Ethan.

532
00:25:40,282 --> 00:25:42,418
×ÖÄ»
And we both know you're better off being tutored

533
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:44,004
×ÖÄ»
by somebody else anyway.

534
00:25:44,004 --> 00:25:44,865
×ÖÄ»
You're right.

535
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:47,781
×ÖÄ»
Tell Thayer hey.

536
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:52,144
×ÖÄ»
I'm... really sorry.

537
00:25:53,477 --> 00:25:54,843
×ÖÄ»
So am I.

538
00:25:59,628 --> 00:26:01,758
×ÖÄ»
Thought Sutton was coming over to help you study.

539
00:26:01,758 --> 00:26:03,181
×ÖÄ»
It's a change of plans.

540
00:26:03,181 --> 00:26:04,764
×ÖÄ»
You pissed her off, didn't you?

541
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:07,511
×ÖÄ»
Yes, I did. Anything else?

542
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:12,144
×ÖÄ»
Ethan, the way I see it, you can either sit here

543
00:26:12,144 --> 00:26:13,866
×ÖÄ»
and feel sorry for yourself,

544
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:16,094
×ÖÄ»
or you can go find Sutton and beg for forgiveness.

545
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:17,541
×ÖÄ»
Because I'm telling you,

546
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,699
×ÖÄ»
her help is the only thing that is standing between you

547
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:21,547
×ÖÄ»
and a trip back to juvie right now.

548
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,423
×ÖÄ»
It's a good speech, Dan.

549
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:28,226
×ÖÄ»
Just a little too late.

550
00:26:33,095 --> 00:26:34,678
×ÖÄ»
Look, nobody wants

551
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,796
×ÖÄ»
these two back together more than I do,

552
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:40,933
×ÖÄ»
but, I mean, one day, they're fighting in public,

553
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,931
×ÖÄ»
and the next day we're in counseling trying

554
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:45,024
×ÖÄ»
to work things out.

555
00:26:45,024 --> 00:26:47,065
×ÖÄ»
Meanwhile, everyone's miserable..

556
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,833
×ÖÄ»
Honey, it's a process.

557
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,875
×ÖÄ»
Your mother and I are both working very hard to try...

558
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,601
×ÖÄ»
When does it end? I'm sorry,

559
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:54,217
×ÖÄ»
I know this is going to sound terrible,

560
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:57,128
×ÖÄ»
but sometimes I look around me and see how

561
00:26:57,128 --> 00:26:58,838
×ÖÄ»
this is affecting everybody,

562
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:03,357
×ÖÄ»
and I just think maybe the two of you are better off...

563
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,143
×ÖÄ»
What are you saying, Sutton?

564
00:27:06,097 --> 00:27:08,826
×ÖÄ»
You want Mom and Dad to get a divorce just because

565
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,550
×ÖÄ»
it's too hard for you to watch them work things out?

566
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,463
×ÖÄ»
I'm saying that they need to make a decision

567
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:15,871
×ÖÄ»
and stick with it.

568
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:18,290
×ÖÄ»
Do you have any idea how selfish you sound right now?

569
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,814
×ÖÄ»
Oh, really, Laurel? And what if Mom actually wants a divorce?

570
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:24,107
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I think maybe everyone needs to take a little time-out.

571
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:25,211
×ÖÄ»
Who asked you?

572
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:26,709
×ÖÄ»
Laurel! That's okay.

573
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:29,981
×ÖÄ»
Actually, I think...

574
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,397
×ÖÄ»
I think I understand what Sutton is saying.

575
00:27:32,397 --> 00:27:36,112
×ÖÄ»
And in her own way, she's, she's just trying to look out for me.

576
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,427
×ÖÄ»
Why do you think that?

577
00:27:37,427 --> 00:27:39,917
×ÖÄ»
Well, Sutton's always been strong-willed,

578
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:43,054
×ÖÄ»
and while it hasn't made it easy being her mom,

579
00:27:44,342 --> 00:27:47,576
×ÖÄ»
I've always just admired that strength.

580
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,965
×ÖÄ»
You know, when she was a baby,

581
00:27:50,965 --> 00:27:53,214
×ÖÄ»
the night Sutton came home to live with us was

582
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:58,630
×ÖÄ»
the happiest of my life, but I was terrified.

583
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,674
×ÖÄ»
I mean, the adoption-- it happened so quickly.

584
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:03,395
×ÖÄ»
I felt so unprepared.

585
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:07,070
×ÖÄ»
What if I did something wrong?

586
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:12,665
×ÖÄ»
What if you cried, and I couldn't comfort you?

587
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:17,192
×ÖÄ»
I stayed with you in the nursery all night just holding you.

588
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:18,972
×ÖÄ»
And you know what?

589
00:28:20,144 --> 00:28:21,553
×ÖÄ»
You didn't cry at all.

590
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,691
×ÖÄ»
You were so calm, just looking around,

591
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:27,212
×ÖÄ»
taking everything in.

592
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:32,682
×ÖÄ»
I know this sounds crazy, but it was almost...

593
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:37,053
×ÖÄ»
it's almost like you were being strong for me.

594
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:43,817
×ÖÄ»
REBECCA:It's great that you intercepted that drawing of me, 

595
00:28:43,817 --> 00:28:47,523
×ÖÄ»
but it is just a reminder that we are running out of time.

596
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:50,163
×ÖÄ»
I think it's time we step things up.

597
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:51,467
×ÖÄ»
Well, what does that mean exactly?

598
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:53,226
×ÖÄ»
Because we're doing everything that we can.

599
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:54,695
×ÖÄ»
Well, are we?

600
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:55,957
×ÖÄ»
I mean, I hate to say it, Sutton,

601
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:58,625
×ÖÄ»
but it sounds like family therapy was kind of a bust.

602
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:01,726
×ÖÄ»
Okay, look, I know it didn't go as well as I had planned,

603
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:03,853
×ÖÄ»
but I'm working on this speech for the banquet,

604
00:29:03,853 --> 00:29:05,102
×ÖÄ»
and trust me...

605
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:08,088
×ÖÄ»
I am covering everything:

606
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:11,577
×ÖÄ»
the lies, the infidelity, the fights

607
00:29:11,577 --> 00:29:13,642
×ÖÄ»
between Ted and Kristin.

608
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:16,103
×ÖÄ»
Well, that's good,

609
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:19,143
×ÖÄ»
um, but I think we need to take things a little bit further.

610
00:29:19,143 --> 00:29:20,644
×ÖÄ»
Well, how much further?

611
00:29:20,644 --> 00:29:22,894
×ÖÄ»
I mean, when you take that stage

612
00:29:23,122 --> 00:29:25,210
×ÖÄ»
with Kristin sitting in the front row,

613
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,996
×ÖÄ»
that's when you tell everybody the truth;

614
00:29:27,996 --> 00:29:31,497
×ÖÄ»
that Dr. Ted Mercer is your biological father.

615
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:33,222
×ÖÄ»
You're kidding. Not at all.

616
00:29:33,222 --> 00:29:34,220
×ÖÄ»
But are you sure?

617
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,992
×ÖÄ»
I mean, look, I know that that's huge,

618
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:40,856
×ÖÄ»
But don't you think it's a little much?

619
00:29:40,856 --> 00:29:44,329
×ÖÄ»
Plus, people will know that you're my mother if I say that.

620
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:45,364
×ÖÄ»
I know...

621
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:48,089
×ÖÄ»
And no one will be more shocked than I. 

622
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,959
×ÖÄ»
After all, who knew that you were the daughter

623
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:56,268
×ÖÄ»
I was forced to give up 17 years ago?

624
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,314
×ÖÄ»
Well, what about Alec?

625
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:01,408
×ÖÄ»
What's he gonna say when all of this comes out?

626
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:03,174
×ÖÄ»
Don't worry about that.

627
00:30:03,206 --> 00:30:05,186
×ÖÄ»
You just work on the speech,

628
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:07,223
×ÖÄ»
and when the time comes,

629
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,460
×ÖÄ»
I'll take care of Alec Rybak.

630
00:30:16,753 --> 00:30:18,539
×ÖÄ»
What's with the suitcase?

631
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:23,033
×ÖÄ»
I mean, I know we've been kind of been avoiding each other,

632
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,662
×ÖÄ»
but you're moving out?

633
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:30,293
×ÖÄ»
You're right, I have been avoiding you,

634
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:32,961
×ÖÄ»
but that's not why I'm leaving.

635
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:33,616
×ÖÄ»
Um...

636
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,217
×ÖÄ»
my dad is staying at Rebecca's now

637
00:30:38,438 --> 00:30:40,552
×ÖÄ»
and wants me to move in with him tomorrow.

638
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:44,110
×ÖÄ»
Rebecca's... where Jordan lives.

639
00:30:44,296 --> 00:30:45,799
×ÖÄ»
Unfortunately.

640
00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:48,294
×ÖÄ»
You know, if you liked him, you could have just told me.

641
00:30:48,294 --> 00:30:50,404
×ÖÄ»
Well, the thing is, I don't.

642
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,769
×ÖÄ»
And now I'm just really sorry that this whole

643
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,999
×ÖÄ»
stupid incident came between us.

644
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:59,254
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, me, too.

645
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,757
×ÖÄ»
We're friends?

646
00:31:02,757 --> 00:31:04,998
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, friends.

647
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:08,295
×ÖÄ»
Well, then, as your friend--

648
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:10,703
×ÖÄ»
and I know you say you're not interested--

649
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,804
×ÖÄ»
but I'm totally over Jordan,

650
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,763
×ÖÄ»
so if you're thinking of kissing him again, go for it.

651
00:31:15,763 --> 00:31:18,075
×ÖÄ»
Thank you, but there are a million reasons why

652
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:19,466
×ÖÄ»
that's never gonna happen,

653
00:31:19,466 --> 00:31:22,031
×ÖÄ»
including the fact that we are practically related.

654
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:23,219
×ÖÄ»
And you're sure about that?

655
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:24,456
×ÖÄ»
Positive.

656
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,463
×ÖÄ»
Hi! Thayer, thank God.

657
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,006
×ÖÄ»
Why didn't you call me back?

658
00:31:39,006 --> 00:31:40,619
×ÖÄ»
Did you get my message about the desk clerk telling me

659
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:42,365
×ÖÄ»
that there were two women at the motel?

660
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:43,336
×ÖÄ»
Okay, slow down.

661
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:45,027
×ÖÄ»
What? I thought you'd be happy to see me.

662
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:48,195
×ÖÄ»
You asked me to come here, and here I am.

663
00:31:48,195 --> 00:31:52,521
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, I am, but I asked you to come with me... two days ago.

664
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:56,022
×ÖÄ»
I didn't realize there was an expiration date.

665
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:57,914
×ÖÄ»
Oh, hey! Who's this?

666
00:31:59,515 --> 00:32:00,754
×ÖÄ»
Uh...

667
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:03,146
×ÖÄ»
uh...

668
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,106
×ÖÄ»
No one.

669
00:32:08,377 --> 00:32:09,237
×ÖÄ»
Emma...

670
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:12,448
×ÖÄ»
Emma, could you stop for a second?

671
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:13,546
×ÖÄ»
That girl you saw is just...

672
00:32:13,546 --> 00:32:14,885
×ÖÄ»
What? Payback? Look, maybe

673
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:17,010
×ÖÄ»
I should have said yes and come with you out here.

674
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,745
×ÖÄ»
But you need to get past the stupid idea

675
00:32:18,745 --> 00:32:20,368
×ÖÄ»
that I have feelings for Ethan!

676
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:21,272
×ÖÄ»
Okay, listen, I really don't

677
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,756
×ÖÄ»
want to talk about this right now, okay?

678
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:24,813
×ÖÄ»
Right now or ever?

679
00:32:25,332 --> 00:32:26,789
×ÖÄ»
Listen, stop.

680
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,320
×ÖÄ»
Can I at least give you a ride to the bus station?

681
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,531
×ÖÄ»
Don't bother.

682
00:32:30,755 --> 00:32:32,772
×ÖÄ»
You don't want to keep your blonde waiting.

683
00:32:32,522 --> 00:32:44,139
{\8an}Ó²×ÖÄ»

684
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,214
×ÖÄ»
Hey. Hi.

685
00:32:49,214 --> 00:32:50,453
×ÖÄ»
Big day, huh?

686
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:51,532
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

687
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:57,041
×ÖÄ»
It could end up being a lot bigger than people realize.

688
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:58,950
×ÖÄ»
What are you talking about?

689
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,654
×ÖÄ»
Nothing.

690
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:03,102
×ÖÄ»
Just nervous for my speech.

691
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:05,887
×ÖÄ»
Still I'm not quite sure what I'm going to say.

692
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:09,779
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, well, before she left, Emma seemed

693
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,267
×ÖÄ»
kind of worried about that, too.

694
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:13,817
×ÖÄ»
Big surprise.

695
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,790
×ÖÄ»
She always expects the worst of me.

696
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,891
×ÖÄ»
Well, maybe this is your chance to prove her wrong.

697
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,435
×ÖÄ»
Oh, hey, sweetheart.

698
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,360
×ÖÄ»
Oh, you look beautiful.

699
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,498
×ÖÄ»
Thank you.

700
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:28,866
×ÖÄ»
You, too.

701
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:31,275
×ÖÄ»
You feeling nervous about your speech?

702
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:33,740
×ÖÄ»
Little more than I thought I would.

703
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,064
×ÖÄ»
It's gonna be fine.

704
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:36,744
×ÖÄ»
Um...

705
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:40,391
×ÖÄ»
Hey, Mom, that story you told yesterday

706
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:43,367
×ÖÄ»
at therapy about my first night at home?

707
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:46,506
×ÖÄ»
How come you never told me that before?

708
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:51,182
×ÖÄ»
Well, honey, I'm-I'm sure I did.

709
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:54,434
×ÖÄ»
Maybe it's just the first time you listened.

710
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:17,048
×ÖÄ»
Oh, my.

711
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:19,758
×ÖÄ»
Hey there.

712
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,473
×ÖÄ»
Moving in already?

713
00:34:22,473 --> 00:34:24,082
×ÖÄ»
No, not until tomorrow.

714
00:34:24,082 --> 00:34:25,271
×Ö
I'm just dropping off a few things. 

715
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,233
Ä» ×ÖÄ»
Why don't you drop your bags and hang out for a minute?

716
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,076
×ÖÄ»
No, thank you.

717
00:34:28,076 --> 00:34:29,518
×ÖÄ»
Well, why don't you let me help you?

718
00:34:31,073 --> 00:34:32,217
×ÖÄ»
Unpack later.

719
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:36,003
×ÖÄ»
What the hell was that?

720
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,579
×ÖÄ»
Stop smiling.

721
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:40,830
×ÖÄ»
'Cause whatever you think is about to happen really isn't.

722
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,113
×ÖÄ»
Oh, is that right?

723
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,101
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

724
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,035
×ÖÄ»
What's really going on here, Mads?

725
00:34:45,035 --> 00:34:46,583
×ÖÄ»
And don't say dropping the sweaters off and stuff,

726
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,107
×ÖÄ»
'cause you could do that tomorrow.

727
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:53,571
×ÖÄ»
I promised myself I wouldn't.

728
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,868
×ÖÄ»
Well, then, I guess you lied.

729
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:07,455
×ÖÄ» ×Ö
The biggest gift my father has given me is

730
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:09,181
Ä»
the example he's set

731
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:13,442
×ÖÄ»
by donating his time and talents to others in need.

732
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:15,391
×ÖÄ»
That's why we're here today,

733
00:35:15,391 --> 00:35:17,783
×ÖÄ»
and it's why I'm proud to call him my dad.

734
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,483
×ÖÄ»
So...

735
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,364
×ÖÄ»
I had written a speech

736
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:39,601
×ÖÄ»
about my dad...

737
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:43,604
×ÖÄ»
um, bunch of clichÃ©s

738
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:45,807
×ÖÄ»
about how great of a doctor he is,

739
00:35:45,807 --> 00:35:47,900
×ÖÄ»
how great of a humanitarian, and don't get me wrong,

740
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,140
×ÖÄ»
that's very true.

741
00:35:51,687 --> 00:35:55,430
×ÖÄ»
But today I want to talk about

742
00:35:55,813 --> 00:35:57,530
×ÖÄ»
another truth.

743
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:02,428
×ÖÄ»
Something you don't know about Ted Mercer.

744
00:36:04,669 --> 00:36:06,773
×ÖÄ»
And that...

745
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,772
×ÖÄ»
And that...

746
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,597
×ÖÄ»
is...

747
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:24,138
×ÖÄ»
that his greatest accomplishment and the smartest thing

748
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:28,188
×ÖÄ»
he has ever done was to marry my mom Kristin Mercer.

749
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:31,837
×ÖÄ»
Because she is the one who makes this family work.

750
00:36:31,837 --> 00:36:34,384
×ÖÄ»
And together, she and my dad

751
00:36:35,256 --> 00:36:37,313
×Ö
have built a life that any child 

752
00:36:37,313 --> 00:36:40,820
Ä» ×ÖÄ»
would be so lucky to be a part of.

753
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,126
×ÖÄ»
Even an ungrateful daughter

754
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:46,670
×ÖÄ»
who hasn't always paid attention

755
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,562
×ÖÄ»
enough to notice.

756
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:57,305
×ÖÄ»
Honey, that was...

757
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,238
×ÖÄ»
Ladies and gentlemen,

758
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:04,334
×ÖÄ»
Phoenix Surgical Humanitarian of the Year, Dr. Ted Mercer.

759
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:05,229
×ÖÄ»
Hey, Sutton.

760
00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:06,508
×ÖÄ»
Ethan, not right now, please.

761
00:37:06,508 --> 00:37:07,981
×ÖÄ»
W-What? That was great.

762
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:10,550
×ÖÄ»
No, it wasn't.

763
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,686
×ÖÄ»
You don't understand. It wasn't great.

764
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:15,529
×ÖÄ»
Are you kidding me? You were real up there.

765
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:19,153
×ÖÄ»
Okay, so many times you've talked about how you've changed,

766
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:20,904
×ÖÄ»
but that was from the heart.

767
00:37:20,904 --> 00:37:22,561
×ÖÄ»
All right, that was the...

768
00:37:22,948 --> 00:37:25,149
×ÖÄ»
that was the Sutton Mercer from the ranch that night.

769
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:28,985
×ÖÄ»
Well, wonderful.

770
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:30,978
×ÖÄ»
I gave a sappy speech about my parents

771
00:37:30,978 --> 00:37:32,256
×ÖÄ»
in front of a bunch of doctors.

772
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:33,997
×ÖÄ»
What is that going to get me?

773
00:37:36,864 --> 00:37:37,805
×ÖÄ»
This.

774
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:55,010
×ÖÄ»
Home sweet home.

775
00:37:57,861 --> 00:37:59,309
×ÖÄ»
So quiet.

776
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:00,365
×ÖÄ»
Jordan.

777
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,618
×ÖÄ»
I think I hear him out by the pool.

778
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:05,290
×ÖÄ»
All right, well, will you say hi for me?

779
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,861
×ÖÄ»
I'm gonna go upstairs and take a bath. Sure.

780
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:08,867
×ÖÄ»
Bye, baby.

781
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:19,985
×ÖÄ»
Alec.

782
00:38:20,412 --> 00:38:21,188
×ÖÄ»
Hey.

783
00:38:22,026 --> 00:38:23,761
×ÖÄ»
How was the, uh, how was the honeymoon?

784
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:26,566
×ÖÄ»
It was memorable.

785
00:38:26,566 --> 00:38:27,224
×ÖÄ»
Good.

786
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:29,744
×ÖÄ»
You're doing laps at this hour, huh?

787
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:30,421
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

788
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:33,787
×ÖÄ»
You haven't seen Mads, have you?

789
00:38:34,782 --> 00:38:37,432
×ÖÄ»
She was going to stop by here and drop some stuff off.

790
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:39,228
×ÖÄ»
No, I haven't seen her.

791
00:38:39,614 --> 00:38:40,192
×ÖÄ»
She might have been here earlier

792
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,546
×ÖÄ»
while I was gone, though.

793
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,350
×ÖÄ»
Don't know. Good night.

794
00:39:00,209 --> 00:39:02,646
×ÖÄ»
I thought you said you weren't going to do that anymore.

795
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:05,108
×ÖÄ»
Well, I thought so, too.

796
00:39:06,631 --> 00:39:08,602
×ÖÄ»
And now we're living under the same roof.

797
00:39:09,128 --> 00:39:10,999
×ÖÄ»
So, things went pretty bad with Thayer, huh?

798
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:11,862
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

799
00:39:12,404 --> 00:39:13,803
×ÖÄ»
Should have known it wouldn't work out, though,

800
00:39:13,803 --> 00:39:16,010
×ÖÄ»
when he didn't return any of my phone calls.

801
00:39:16,347 --> 00:39:18,369
×ÖÄ»
Oh, well, when are you coming back?

802
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:19,192
×ÖÄ»
Soon.

803
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:21,130
×ÖÄ»
The last bus out last night was canceled,

804
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,652
×ÖÄ»
so I had to sleep here at the station, and it was just...

805
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,894
×ÖÄ»
Shower's free if you want it.

806
00:39:24,894 --> 00:39:25,905
×ÖÄ»
Who are you talking to?

807
00:39:27,189 --> 00:39:29,225
×ÖÄ»
Sutton. Oh, great.

808
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:32,906
×ÖÄ»
Hey, I didn't realize you'd left already, but I just wanted

809
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:35,187
×ÖÄ»
to say good luck at regionals

810
00:39:35,187 --> 00:39:37,165
×ÖÄ»
and reiterate how completely genius

811
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:38,952
×ÖÄ»
that speech was last night.

812
00:39:39,907 --> 00:39:41,034
×ÖÄ»
Thank you.

813
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:42,159
×ÖÄ»
Love you.

814
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:46,391
×ÖÄ»
Anyways, um,

815
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:49,413
×ÖÄ»
I guess I will just check in on you later, okay?

816
00:39:49,413 --> 00:39:51,063
×ÖÄ»
Wait, Mads, no, don't, tell me what...

817
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:00,769
×ÖÄ»
Sutton, I thought you were on your...

818
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:02,470
×ÖÄ»
Running late, so do you mind moving?

819
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,875
×ÖÄ»
I can get a yogurt.

820
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,720
×ÖÄ»
Thank you.

821
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:12,220

823
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,638
×ÖÄ»
Thank you.

824
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:31,361
×ÖÄ»
You missed this.

825
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:34,298
×ÖÄ»
What are you doing here?

826
00:40:34,527 --> 00:40:35,653
×ÖÄ»
Oh, I checked the bus schedule,

827
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:37,776
×ÖÄ»
figured I still might be able to catch you.

828
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,652
×ÖÄ»
Listen, Emma, that girl you saw at my apartment

829
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:45,095
×ÖÄ»
is just a friend.

830
00:40:45,564 --> 00:40:48,008
×ÖÄ»
We surf together, but that's it.

831
00:40:48,008 --> 00:40:49,992
×ÖÄ»
Well, why didn't you just tell me that?

832
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,548
×ÖÄ»
Because I can be hardheaded sometimes.

833
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:55,059
×ÖÄ»
But I also don't want to be one of those guys

834
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:57,308
×Ö
That lets pride get in the way of what he really wants. 

835
00:40:57,481 --> 00:40:59,025
Ä» ×ÖÄ»
and what do you really want?

836
00:40:59,478 --> 00:41:00,773
×ÖÄ»
One question:

837
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,845
×ÖÄ»
those messages you left about Sutton

838
00:41:02,845 --> 00:41:04,457
×ÖÄ»
and the second woman at the motel--

839
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:06,902
×ÖÄ»
did you come here because you want my help

840
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:08,471
×ÖÄ»
or because you want me?

841
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,907
×ÖÄ»
Both.

842
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,868
×ÖÄ»
Thayer, when you left, I-I...

843
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:30,992
{\8an}Ó²×ÖÄ»

844
00:41:38,093 --> 00:41:39,986
×ÖÄ»
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

845
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:43,015
×ÖÄ»
What the hell happened at the banquet?

846
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:44,877
×ÖÄ»
I don't know, I...

847
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:48,406
×ÖÄ»
You had a golden opportunity and you folded.

848
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,099
×ÖÄ»
Are you going soft on me?

849
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:51,050
×ÖÄ»
No...

850
00:41:52,908 --> 00:41:54,775
×ÖÄ»
Look, I just realized that my feelings for Kristin

851
00:41:54,775 --> 00:41:57,534
×ÖÄ»
are a little bit more complicated than I had thought.

852
00:41:57,534 --> 00:42:00,567
×ÖÄ»
And I know she's not my mother, but I...

853
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:03,041
×ÖÄ»
But maybe you prefer her to be.

854
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:03,878
×ÖÄ»
No.

855
00:42:05,294 --> 00:42:07,773
×ÖÄ»
I was just up on that stage, and-and to humiliate her

856
00:42:07,773 --> 00:42:09,315
×ÖÄ»
in front of everybody--

857
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,753
×ÖÄ»
I'm just not as okay with it as you are.

858
00:42:11,753 --> 00:42:13,751
×ÖÄ»
Well, I'm very sorry to hear that, sweetheart,

859
00:42:13,751 --> 00:42:15,309
×ÖÄ»
because now you've forced me to do something

860
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:17,060
×ÖÄ»
I was hoping I could avoid.

861
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,389
×ÖÄ»
What is this?

862
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:21,526
×ÖÄ»
It's a journal, handwritten by Kristin Mercer.

863
00:42:21,526 --> 00:42:23,759
×Ö
Read it and you'll see, when you were a baby, 

864
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:27,456
Ä» ×ÖÄ»
that this "Wonderful mother" That you spoke so glowingly about

865
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:30,307
×ÖÄ»
wanted to give you away.
