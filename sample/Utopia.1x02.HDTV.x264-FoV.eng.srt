2
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:25,200
'It's a comic?'

3
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,480
No, it's a graphic novel.

4
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,800
It's called Utopia Experiments.

5
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:33,240
You had this. Where is it?

6
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:35,720
It's just one of those conspiracy
theories.

7
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,660
- What about Utopia, then?
- Tell him, Becky.

8
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:41,745
Utopia Part Two, there must be
something in it that they want.

9
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:43,745
I also live with my mum.

10
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:47,065
Jesus Christ! You're going
to make me cry now, Ian.

11
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,265
I'm mission?

12
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,225
You should persuade him to take it.

13
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:54,225
What about the vaccine? Russian flu.
I think we could reconsider.

14
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:56,025
He signed.

15
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:57,505
He's fucking resigning, Michael.

16
00:01:57,506 --> 00:02:01,305
My mate's going to ask you
a question.

17
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:05,305
Where is Jessica Hyde?

18
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:23,945
My name is Jessica Hyde.

19
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:26,265
Come with me now or you'll all die.

20
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:28,505
Who are you and what's going on?

21
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:30,105
Ian, don't point that gun at me.

22
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:33,705
How... how do you know my name?

23
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:35,305
Jessica Hyde?

24
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:39,305
Wilson? They did this.

25
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:42,985
We all have to go now.

26
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:45,305
We're not going anywhere until
you tell us who you are,

27
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:47,505
how you know my name
and what the fuck is going on.

28
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:49,025
Ian, you won't be able to shoot me.

29
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:50,585
Yeah? Don't imagine I won't, "Jess".

30
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,505
No, really, you won't
be able to shoot me.

31
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:56,505
You've got the safety catch on.

32
00:02:56,506 --> 00:03:00,505
They don't generally have
safety catches, except on telly.

33
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,785
Every second we stay here is a
second they are getting closer

34
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:12,785
and they'll kill us all.
Please, come with me.

35
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,985
What about my dad? He's going home.

36
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:19,065
I've arranged for someone to pick
up your dad from where he works.

37
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,025
You don't know where he works.

38
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:23,025
Davingdon's on Vesta Road.

39
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:27,025
They're picking him up now.
I promise.

40
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:35,385
I'm not sure about this.

41
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:37,865
You two ready?

42
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:40,305
Yeah, we're ready.

43
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:44,305
There's CCTV at both ends of your
street. We'll go through the back.

44
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:08,905
Stay there.

45
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:18,825
What if someone's in?

46
00:04:57,346 --> 00:05:00,425
Social uprest
if prices continue to rise.

47
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:04,185
The Shadow Home Secretary has
suggested the Government's apparent

48
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:08,185
lack of planning
could lead to outbreak of...

49
00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:19,665
Is this your car?

50
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:23,665
You're so cute.

51
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:29,785
Are you going to tell us what's
going on? Who's after us?

52
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:38,305
In the 1970s, the Soviets set up
a germ warfare programme called

53
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:42,265
Biopreparat. It was huge.

54
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:46,265
They were weaponising anthrax,
Ebola, smallpox, on a massive scale.

55
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:51,265
The West panicked and created an
organisation to combat the threat.

56
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:53,785
It was known as The Network.

57
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,785
It was based in no country,
reported to no-one

58
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:58,225
and was utterly deniable.

59
00:05:58,226 --> 00:06:02,225
It did things democratic
governments couldn't.

60
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:06,025
They were insane,
totally out of control.

61
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:09,145
What's that got to do with us?

62
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:13,145
Basically, that's who's after you.

63
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:17,985
You're fucking joking, right?

64
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:54,745
Right.

65
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:58,745
Do you know where that is yet?

66
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,705
No.

67
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:05,705
I'll come later, anyway.

68
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,905
Gimmme the gun.

69
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,945
We need clothes and money.
Your accounts are useless now.

70
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:38,905
You're going to rob them?

71
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:42,905
Let me make this very clear. Your
lives as you knew them are over.

72
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,265
What the next 48 hours are about
is abandoning everything you knew

73
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,625
or thought you could rely on
and adjusting to the new reality.

74
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:54,625
If you can adjust you will live.
If you can't you will die.

75
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:57,985
Now we need to change
the way you look.

76
00:07:57,986 --> 00:08:01,985
We need to get very far away
and we need drugs for Wilson.

77
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:08,705
Give me the gun.

78
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:12,705
Ian, hang on,
can we talk about this?

79
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:16,585
I mean, it's an armed robbery.

80
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:20,585
It's adjust or die, Ian.

81
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,545
I don't know what to think of her.

82
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:06,545
You could've fooled me.

83
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:12,545
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

84
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:23,465
What, you just going
to watch, are you?

85
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:28,145
Here. Diamorphine.

86
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:29,345
What, heroin?

87
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:32,185
It's a painkiller. Do for now.

88
00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:34,145
You look good.

89
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:37,145
Should wear that colour more often.

90
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:41,145
You look shit. But in a good way.

91
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:44,865
We need to get out of the city.

92
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:47,185
We'll transfer to a van to
keep Wilson out of sight,

93
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:51,185
then burn this out.

94
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:09,665
Do you have the manuscript, Ian?

95
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:14,505
Utopia Part Two.

96
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:17,865
You need to tell me if you have it.

97
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,665
We don't.

98
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:24,145
Bejan never turned up.

99
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:27,545
I haven't got Wilson's father.

100
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:30,025
I need to do things
to keep us alive.

101
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:32,465
Some of those things you
wouldn't normally approve of.

102
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,305
This is insane.

103
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:36,985
Yesterday I was arrested for a
sex crime, today I'm on the run

104
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:39,565
from ex-government nutters
who want to pull out my eyes.

105
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:41,711
I'm a fucking IT consultant.

106
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:47,946
Geoff?
Hmmm?

107
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,186
Have you seen this?

108
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:52,786
Oh yes.

109
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:56,146
Those bastards have got real
a bee in their bonnet about
the bloody vaccine.

110
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:59,186
But they've named me.

111
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:03,186
Well, you did buy it, Michael.

112
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:07,626
In any case, there's nothing we can
do about it. We're tied into the
contract.

113
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:11,626
Well... we're not, actually.

114
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:13,426
I've found a cancellation clause.

115
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:16,346
It can be enacted
if the department's total spend with

116
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:19,204
the supplier is over 240 million.

117
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:22,324
It's to ensure diversity of supply.

118
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,764
Yeah, but this is only 83 million,
Michael, I mean...

119
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:28,764
No, but it's total spend. We get
two other vaccines from Corvadt.

120
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:35,244
Plus a wide range of antibiotics,
cytotoxics, hypoglycaemics...

121
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:41,644
I mean, this puts us
well over 240 mil.

122
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:48,204
Have the contracts sent to me
immediately. No-one to see them.

123
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:51,004
Look, whatever Corvadt
are paying you,

124
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:54,924
we are not going to
get away with it.

125
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:57,364
We can stop all this.

126
00:11:57,365 --> 00:12:01,364
We can stop it all now.

127
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:07,244
It's horrendous trying
to conceive, isn't it?

128
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:11,644
The medical nature of it all,
the IVF, all that science.

129
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,004
A man needs warmth.

130
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,164
So I understand you fucking
a prostitute, I do.

131
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:22,164
What I don't understand
is you getting her pregnant.

132
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:28,884
Do you think
your wife will understand?

133
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:34,604
Get the contract
straight over to me now.

134
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:38,804
It's for the best.

135
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,964
Ian and I are going up ahead to...

136
00:12:57,965 --> 00:13:01,964
Great. Have fun.

137
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,444
Where are we going?

138
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:13,404
I hack airline companies,
look for people going on holiday,

139
00:13:13,405 --> 00:13:17,404
stay at their houses.
They never know.

140
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,444
This is connected to
a trip wire in the drive.

141
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:24,164
Have everything by the back door,
always be ready to leave

142
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:27,924
within 60 seconds.

143
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:29,484
What if you're in the bath?

144
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:32,564
No baths, no showers.

145
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:35,124
It's time to stop worrying
about looking pretty, Becky.

146
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:39,124
Are you trying to wind me up?

147
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:43,124
There'd be no value
to that that I can see.

148
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:46,404
You got a thing for
tough women, is it?

149
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,404
Don't worry, Ian. I get it.

150
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:52,324
Imagine her big,
strong arms around you.What?

151
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:54,284
You let us walk into this.

152
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:56,244
I mean, how much did you know?

153
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:58,644
Because we had no idea.
Look at Wilson's face.

154
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:00,164
And that is not my fault!

155
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:01,924
Tell that to his dad.

156
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:05,924
Because she doesn't have him,
by the way.

157
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:11,284
Tell us the truth. All of it,
not bits, not pieces, all.

158
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:15,044
Or I leave.

159
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:17,204
Would you at least like
to sit down first, Becky?

160
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:21,204
No, Jessica. I fucking wouldn't.

161
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:28,284
The Network was created by two men.

162
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:32,244
A geneticist called Philip Carvel,
and someone called Mr Rabbit...

163
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:34,004
Mr Rabbit?

164
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:37,844
It's a codename, no-one knows
the real identity.

165
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:40,004
When the cold war began to wind down,

166
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,164
the various governments involved
decided to back away.

167
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:47,164
Only thing was, Mr Rabbit and
Carvel had no intention of stopping.

168
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:53,684
At some point, Carvel wanted out.

169
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:56,204
So they tortured him
to keep him working

170
00:14:56,205 --> 00:15:00,204
and held his daughter hostage.

171
00:15:00,285 --> 00:15:04,284
Eventually, his mind snapped
and he went mad.

172
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:10,324
He was going be got rid of
but somehow he was smuggled out,

173
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:14,324
given a new name and hidden
in a psychiatric hospital.

174
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:18,404
The hospital was Shenley.

175
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:20,844
And the new name was Mark Dane.

176
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:22,684
What, you...

177
00:15:22,685 --> 00:15:26,684
you mean Carvel wrote Utopia?

178
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:30,684
A therapist got him drawing.

179
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:33,604
What he drew was...

180
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:34,804
incredible.

181
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:38,044
So all the things
in Utopia are real?

182
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:42,044
What, like BSE, they created that?

183
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:44,524
It's hard to say
what's real and what's not.

184
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:48,524
But, yeah. BSE was theirs.

185
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:52,564
How do you know all this?

186
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:56,404
I'm Philip Carvel's daughter.

187
00:15:56,405 --> 00:16:00,404
I was smuggled out
with him when I was four.

188
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:04,884
I've been on the run ever since.

189
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:42,084
Did you pricks give me heroin?

190
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:46,084
We had to, for the pain. Oh.

191
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:49,844
Hope it wasn't Afghan.

192
00:16:49,845 --> 00:16:52,924
Taliban have been altering it
for years to make us infertile.

193
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:56,924
Everyone knows that.

194
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:19,124
We need to find Utopia.

195
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,124
We start with where it came from.

196
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,324
What? What about the others?

197
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:27,324
It's fine. I left a note.

198
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:30,084
"Back soon, don't have a bath."

199
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:31,964
Look, Wilson needs someone to...

200
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:33,324
That is not the reason!

201
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:37,044
Don't you see what she's doing?
She's trying to divide us!

202
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:39,364
- Becky, that makes no sense.
- Then why take you and not me?

203
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:41,284
Because you're not strong enough.

204
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:44,084
I can't risk taking you.

205
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:47,284
I know stuff.
I know more than he does.

206
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:48,924
What about Corvadt?

207
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:51,004
They're involved,
they gave people disease.

208
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:55,004
What about Corvadt?
They're involved, so what?

209
00:17:55,085 --> 00:17:59,084
They're a bit player.

210
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:03,244
You're not ready, Becky.

211
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:08,564
- Look, you just need time to...
- Right, go on then.

212
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:12,564
Fuck off!

213
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:35,324
What's that?

214
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:38,484
It's nothing.

215
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,084
It's work.

216
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:44,084
Don't worry.

217
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,244
'I very scared.'

218
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:50,044
I know, I mean...

219
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:54,044
They find out I pregnant,
they angry.

220
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:57,364
You just have to get me some time.

221
00:18:57,365 --> 00:18:59,484
Michael, I think I watched.

222
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:01,684
Watched? By who?

223
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:04,444
Don't know. I scared.

224
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:07,244
They come now.
Michael, you help, yes?

225
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:11,244
You good man, yes...?

226
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,244
Michael Dugdale?

227
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:21,324
My name's William Kaye,
I'm a journalist,

228
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:25,124
I want to talk
about the flu vaccine.

229
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:29,844
- No, no, I'm sorry...
- Listen to me! Your life is in danger.

230
00:19:30,245 --> 00:19:32,684
This isn't about a fucking story!

231
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,084
If I just wanted a story,

232
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:38,084
I'd report the fact that you've got
a Russian prostitute pregnant.

233
00:19:39,565 --> 00:19:43,564
There's my card.

234
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:47,484
Things are going to get mad.

235
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:51,484
You'll need me when they do.

236
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:59,884
Bejan got Utopia
from the comic shop.

237
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:05,924
They got it from
a dealer in Scotland...

238
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,044
who is now dead.

239
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:12,804
And he got it from this guy,
Jack Tate.

240
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,364
And who's Jack Tate?

241
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:18,364
The man who published Utopia.

242
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:24,404
Mrs Tate?

243
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:25,444
Yes.

244
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:27,084
We need to speak to your husband.

245
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:29,204
Right.

246
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:33,204
My... husband's dead.

247
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:36,324
Do you want to come in?

248
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:40,324
This was his study.

249
00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:45,484
Can you tell us where he died?

250
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:50,484
The A22 under the Hailsham Bridge.

251
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:52,964
He walked out in front of a lorry.

252
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,804
I'm sorry. Do you miss him?

253
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:59,804
Of course I miss him.

254
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:04,684
Actually, I have something
you might be interested in.

255
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:08,684
Yes, it's a... thing, I can't
describe it, papers and drawings.

256
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:13,604
That sounds like exactly
the sort of thing we're looking for.

257
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:24,524
We have to get out of here, now.

258
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:28,524
What? Why?

259
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:33,364
You might want these papers...

260
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:36,684
What the fuck have you done?!

261
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:37,524
She's with them.

262
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:39,284
What? What are you talking about?

263
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:43,284
Police turn up asking to see your
dead husband and you don't ask why?

264
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:47,444
Ah, shit.

265
00:21:47,445 --> 00:21:49,804
Glock 22.

266
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:50,924
She's CIA.

267
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:53,644
It means she knows
next to fucking nothing.

268
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,684
That's how they work.

269
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:57,004
They have people high up

270
00:21:57,005 --> 00:22:01,004
who get their drones
to do their work for them.

271
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:24,644
You're going to answer my questions.

272
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:28,644
And if I think
you've told me even one lie...

273
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:31,724
I'll put this wire
in the water...

274
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,564
plug this in,

275
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:36,364
flip the switch.

276
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:40,364
Understand?

277
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:53,164
Why are you here?

278
00:22:53,365 --> 00:22:55,924
We got a tip-off.

279
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:58,404
The man who lived here

280
00:22:58,405 --> 00:23:02,404
has been wanted on terrorism
charges for over 25 years.

281
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:06,324
We were too late,
he'd killed already himself,

282
00:23:06,325 --> 00:23:10,324
so... so we took his wife in.

283
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:14,084
Has the wife given
you any information?

284
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:18,084
I don't know.

285
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,524
What did she say when you got here?

286
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:24,524
On the day he died he was talking
crazy, he wasn't making sense,

287
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:27,444
he said he'd been
visited by a tramp...

288
00:23:27,445 --> 00:23:30,964
"A tramp"?

289
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:34,964
"A tramp" or "THE tramp"?

290
00:23:35,525 --> 00:23:38,364
I don't know, "the" maybe, or...?

291
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:39,644
Look, hang on...

292
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:43,164
I asked you a question.

293
00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:45,884
Was it "a tramp",

294
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:47,844
or "the tramp"?

295
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:51,844
"The". It was "the",
definitely "the".

296
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:57,393
She said "the".

297
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:04,298
- A select committee?
- Yes.

298
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:08,367
With powers to look into all
aspects of the acquisition process.

299
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:12,647
This is not going away, Geoff.
They're announcing it tomorrow.

300
00:24:14,448 --> 00:24:18,247
Do nothing. Keep quiet.

301
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,647
The morning will bring something new.
It always does.

302
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:24,047
Geoff, we can't do nothing!

303
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:27,420
Well, it's sort of an order,
actually.

304
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:30,660
Worry less.

305
00:24:30,661 --> 00:24:33,620
Look, I know it's scary now.

306
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:37,620
But tomorrow you'll be a hero,
I promise.

307
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:32,700
You didn't call in.

308
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:36,420
We were worried.

309
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:38,780
You're not agency. Who are you?

310
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:42,060
No.

311
00:25:42,061 --> 00:25:46,060
I'm not agency.
I'm a specialist.

312
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:51,980
What did you tell them?

313
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:54,060
What did I tell them?

314
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:58,060
They were going to fucking fry me,
what do you think I told them?
I told them everything I knew.

315
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:03,580
Was it her?

316
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:05,820
Yeah.

317
00:26:05,821 --> 00:26:08,100
Yeah, it was her.

318
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:12,100
She was with
a young black male, 25, 28.

319
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:20,420
Was a young man there?

320
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:25,460
Messed-up face, missing an eye?

321
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,580
Er...

322
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:35,860
no.

323
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:39,860
No, just them.

324
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:55,500
Look, are you going to untie me?

325
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:06,820
Wow. That looks great.

326
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:10,820
It's like, um, pirate chic.

327
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:13,020
How's your sight?

328
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:17,020
Er... I can see shapes and colours.

329
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:23,940
Thanks for looking after me, Becky.

330
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:31,820
Where's my dad?

331
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:36,260
She lied.

332
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:39,060
She had to get us out, Wilson.

333
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:41,060
I mean, he's probably fine.

334
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:42,100
I need to find out.

335
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:43,700
We can't.

336
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:46,460
They'll be monitoring our families,
we'll put them in danger...

337
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:49,020
Look online, I'll show you how to
disguise the search.

338
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:50,900
I swear they won't know it
came from here.

339
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:52,020
Wilson, we can't.

340
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:56,020
I need to know.

341
00:27:56,461 --> 00:28:00,420
Please.

342
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:02,580
His name's Milton.

343
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,660
Milton? Milton Wilson?

344
00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:09,660
What is it
with your family and names?

345
00:28:10,261 --> 00:28:12,500
Right, you're sure they can't trace
this?

346
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:14,980
Positive. He's a cricket nut,
he logs in every day.

347
00:28:14,981 --> 00:28:17,260
You'll see whether or not
he's logged in.

348
00:28:17,261 --> 00:28:18,460
Is he there?

349
00:28:18,461 --> 00:28:22,460
Hang on, I'm not in yet.

350
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:33,340
Is he there?

351
00:28:36,101 --> 00:28:40,100
Er... Yeah.

352
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:47,220
Yeah, yeah, he's there, he's fine.

353
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:56,620
Grant has the manuscript.

354
00:28:56,861 --> 00:29:00,860
I heard them talking about it,
they mentioned him.

355
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:05,740
I weren't going to fucking tell her.

356
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:28,460
Who are you, then?

357
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:33,100
I'm Alice.

358
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:35,580
What are you doing?

359
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:37,100
You're not from this school.

360
00:29:37,101 --> 00:29:38,580
Just fuck off before you get hurt!

361
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:41,060
I'm not scared of you!

362
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:44,780
What's that?

363
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:46,180
Comic.

364
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:50,180
Well? Are you going to show me or
are you going to be a twat all day?

365
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:59,660
Are you going to tell me your name,
then, twat?

366
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:01,340
Grant.

367
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,940
Pleased to meet you, Grant.

368
00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:06,940
Alice.

369
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:10,940
Shit!

370
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:12,620
Don't go.

371
00:30:12,621 --> 00:30:16,620
Same time tomorrow, twat.

372
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:28,300
Are you sure this'll work?

373
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:30,340
Fanaticomix?
Grant's addicted to it.

374
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:31,620
It's nerd heaven.

375
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,020
And you have to read the personals
or you miss the good stuff.

376
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:39,020
I don't, but other people do.

377
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:43,340
But what if they're monitoring it?

378
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,500
Say to meet at the Embassy.

379
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:48,100
Dane based the Embassy
on the Taunton building

380
00:30:48,101 --> 00:30:49,940
on the Kame Hill Estate.

381
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:53,940
Only a real twat would know that.

382
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:56,460
And me.

383
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:59,140
Never deny your inner twat, Wilson.

384
00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:01,300
It's part of your charm.

385
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:05,300
Oh.

386
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:23,060
20...

387
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:27,060
and then six plus something
equals 20...

388
00:31:42,261 --> 00:31:44,260
Don't forget to brush.

389
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:45,620
I won't.

390
00:31:45,621 --> 00:31:47,260
Good night, Mummy.

391
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:48,780
Sleep tight, darling.

392
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,780
Love you.

00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:14,300
What are you doing?

400
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:17,940
Can I sleep on your floor?

401
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:21,940
I won't do nothing, I promise.

402
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:32,180
Have you got that comic?

403
00:32:32,221 --> 00:32:34,180
This is so beautiful.

404
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:36,460
Yeah. And that's part two.

405
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:40,460
No-one's ever seen that,
just you and me.

406
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:45,460
You're quite surprising, you know.

407
00:32:45,461 --> 00:32:49,460
You strike me more as a
Spider-Man type.

408
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:53,180
Oh, we should sleep.

409
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:55,047
If my mum sees a light,
she'll come in.

410
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:53,715
Twat.

411
00:33:53,716 --> 00:33:57,715
Thanks for letting me read Utopia.

412
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:13,355
Just to look after, like.

413
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:16,475
Keep it under your bed.

414
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:19,755
I-I-I'll come back...

415
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:23,755
for that.

416
00:34:34,076 --> 00:34:36,115
Did they come back last night?

417
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:40,115
Nope. Wankers.

418
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:43,835
What we going to do?

419
00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:45,995
I know what I'm going to do.

420
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:49,795
I'm going to have a fucking bath.

421
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,815
'We're getting more information

422
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,339
'on our breaking news story -

423
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,779
'the outbreak of flu
in the Shetland Islands.

424
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,219
'We can confirm
two more people have now died

425
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,859
'bringing the death toll to 11.

426
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,939
'That's 11 now dead
on the Shetland Island of Fetlar

427
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,819
'from the suspected
outbreak of Russian flu.'

428
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,059
Shit!

429
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:17,139
18 dead, 33 infected.
There's only 86 on the island.

430
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,619
Geoff's ordered a quarantine.
No-one gets in or out.

431
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,299
Right.

432
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,299
If it's a new strain, it's got
infection rates already of 58%.

433
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,659
Michael, thank god
you got the vaccine.

434
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:37,019
You're a fucking hero.

435
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,899
You tell them my name?
Did you tell them my fucking name?

436
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,539
No, no, I didn't say anything.

437
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,859
I think they're on to me.

438
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,939
I think I'm being followed.
I saw two men.

439
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:01,507
Jesus Christ!

440
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:03,387
Have you seen the news?

441
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:06,427
It's happening. I told you.

442
00:36:06,428 --> 00:36:09,307
What do I do?

443
00:36:09,308 --> 00:36:13,307
I mean, people are dying!

444
00:36:14,948 --> 00:36:17,467
We need a sample of the vaccine.

445
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:19,667
You can request one
direct from Corvadt.

446
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:22,787
It's within your remit as advisor.
There's a man in Sheffield.

447
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:26,787
A scientist called Donaldson.
Get it to him.

448
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:30,947
What about you?

449
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:36,067
What about you?

450
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:14,547
Do exactly as I fucking say!

451
00:37:18,188 --> 00:37:22,067
The Tramp used to be a scientist
with the Network. He got out.

452
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:24,587
Now he monitors their activities.

453
00:37:24,588 --> 00:37:27,987
He has to keep under the radar
to stay alive.

454
00:37:27,988 --> 00:37:29,747
I reckon that's his office.

455
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,307
A public phone?

456
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:36,227
Here we go.

457
00:37:36,228 --> 00:37:38,627
Him? But...

458
00:37:38,628 --> 00:37:40,827
He really is a tramp?

459
00:37:40,828 --> 00:37:44,827
Yeah, he's called 'The Tramp', Ian.

460
00:37:52,388 --> 00:37:56,027
Hello, Danny.

461
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:59,467
Oh, shit! Oh!

462
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:03,467
Fucking hell!

463
00:38:03,988 --> 00:38:07,707
You nearly broke my nose. You
nearly broke my fucking nose!

464
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,187
Jessica, how lovely.

465
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:12,987
How did you know Utopia
had a part two?

466
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:15,667
He's on our side, isn't he?

467
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,787
There's no sides.

468
00:38:18,788 --> 00:38:22,747
Just people who help you
and people who don't.

469
00:38:22,748 --> 00:38:25,827
Now, now, Jess, you know
a gentleman never reveals his...

470
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:29,827
Don't make me ask you again, Danny.

471
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:34,187
Jack told me years ago.

472
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:38,107
I went to see him now
because I wanted part two.

473
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,987
I knew Jack from
the old days, you see.

474
00:38:39,988 --> 00:38:41,627
Why?

475
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:43,347
What's in it?

476
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:44,587
He never told me,

477
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:48,307
and when your father died
it didn't matter any more

478
00:38:48,308 --> 00:38:52,307
but now they have something.

479
00:38:54,188 --> 00:38:58,187
Your father was working on a project
called Janus before he died.

480
00:39:00,148 --> 00:39:03,147
They've replicated his research.

481
00:39:03,148 --> 00:39:07,147
They have it.
They're going to test it.

482
00:39:07,908 --> 00:39:11,587
And what does Janus do?

483
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:14,267
I swear I don't know.

484
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,307
The last thing
your father was working on

485
00:39:16,308 --> 00:39:20,307
were viral delivery vectors
that attack the human genome.

486
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:25,747
And Tate? What did he say?

487
00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:28,547
He said that this is the end.

488
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:32,147
He said we are all finished.

489
00:39:32,148 --> 00:39:36,147
And he took his own life.

490
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:40,587
We need to work together, Jess,
you and I...

491
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:44,587
What I still don't get is
what you were going to do with it.

492
00:39:46,748 --> 00:39:50,747
I mean, what use would it be to a
decrepit old sack of filth like you?

493
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:58,347
What do you think your last breath
will feel like, Danny?

494
00:40:05,588 --> 00:40:07,827
There's a woman. MI5.

495
00:40:07,828 --> 00:40:09,287
They already have MI5.

496
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:13,314
Not this one. She's like us.
Works in secret, trusts no-one.

497
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:16,121
She can help.

498
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:20,121
Now, Jess, if you get me
the manuscript I can get it to her.

499
00:40:20,562 --> 00:40:24,561
What's her name?

500
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:29,041
Please don't make me
tell you that, Jessica.

501
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:39,681
Milner. Her name's Milner.

502
00:40:40,322 --> 00:40:44,321
She's a good woman, Jessica.

503
00:40:44,722 --> 00:40:48,201
Ian, we need a vehicle.
You've seen me enough times.

504
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:52,201
It's time for you to do it.

505
00:41:01,402 --> 00:41:04,441
Why didn't he give it to you?

506
00:41:04,442 --> 00:41:08,441
Bit odd?

507
00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:12,921
I'm on your side, Jessica,
you know that.

508
00:41:12,922 --> 00:41:16,921
I'm one of the...

509
00:41:55,762 --> 00:41:57,921
If we found him, they would.

510
00:41:57,922 --> 00:42:01,201
He gave up Milner's name like that.
You saw what they did to Wilson.

511
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:03,121
So you just killed him?

512
00:42:03,122 --> 00:42:06,081
- I pulled up the ladder.
- What?

513
00:42:06,082 --> 00:42:09,521
You fucking killed him!
You took his life!

514
00:42:09,522 --> 00:42:13,521
You just kill people if they're
not convenient, is that it?

515
00:42:15,762 --> 00:42:19,761
Why are you being so odd?

516
00:42:32,162 --> 00:42:36,161
What the fuck are you doing?

517
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:44,201
They... They just came in.

518
00:42:44,202 --> 00:42:46,241
So you tied them up?

519
00:42:46,242 --> 00:42:49,881
Children? You tied up children?

520
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:52,481
We're making it
look like a burglary!

521
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:55,441
You did the right thing.

522
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:58,001
We meet here tomorrow, 10pm.

523
00:42:58,002 --> 00:43:02,001
Keep Wilson out of sight.
Stay on country roads, avoid CCTV.

524
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:06,041
You did exactly the right thing.

525
00:43:10,242 --> 00:43:14,241
So, I-I-I want
a sample of the vaccine.

526
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:20,681
I-I-I'm sure you understand,
with the events of last night.

527
00:43:20,802 --> 00:43:24,801
So, this is an R680 request...

528
00:43:25,682 --> 00:43:28,841
Excellent, yes. You want a sample.

529
00:43:28,842 --> 00:43:32,841
Yes, it's all filled. It's all
in order. The paperwork is...

530
00:43:33,242 --> 00:43:37,241
What do you want it for?

531
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:44,121
You are contractually obliged
to supply a sample within 48 hours.

532
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:47,401
Yes, of course. Something wrong?

533
00:43:47,402 --> 00:43:50,881
No, no, nothing's wrong.
I just need... I want a sample.

534
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,201
I can do that.

535
00:43:52,202 --> 00:43:55,721
'Freelance journalist,
William Kaye has been murdered

536
00:43:55,722 --> 00:43:58,241
'in a car park in Wapping
in East London,

537
00:43:58,242 --> 00:44:02,201
'in what is being described by police
as a gangland-style execution.

538
00:44:02,202 --> 00:44:06,201
'Mr Kaye was shot three times
in the chest and once in the head.

539
00:44:06,202 --> 00:44:08,161
'Police have a suspect in custody,

540
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:11,441
'a Russian National
named as Anya Lutchenko.'

541
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:12,841
Anya?!

542
00:44:12,842 --> 00:44:16,081
'Police have described her
as a sex worker. The detective...'

543
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:28,561
How's your wife, Dugdale?

544
00:44:28,562 --> 00:44:32,561
Still trying to conceive, are you?

545
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:36,961
Still trying for a little baby?

546
00:44:39,162 --> 00:44:43,161
Forget the vaccine, Mr Dugdale.
You're not a spy.

547
00:44:46,362 --> 00:44:49,281
Becky, they'll be in
the Taunton Building.

548
00:44:49,282 --> 00:44:52,361
It's a huge water tower

549
00:44:52,362 --> 00:44:53,721
and, Becky, be careful.

550
00:44:53,722 --> 00:44:57,721
Grant's a city trader.
He's bound to be a cock.

551
00:45:36,962 --> 00:45:40,481
Are you Becky?

552
00:45:40,482 --> 00:45:44,481
Grant?

553
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:53,041
I thought you were a city trader?

554
00:45:59,682 --> 00:46:01,201
Fuck me.

555
00:46:01,202 --> 00:46:05,201
Don't worry. It's just Wilson.
He's been hurt.

556
00:46:05,242 --> 00:46:09,241
You better get in the back with him.

557
00:46:09,322 --> 00:46:11,681
Wilson Wilson?

558
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:13,561
You look a mess, man.

559
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,321
Bloody hell, you sound about ten.

560
00:46:15,322 --> 00:46:17,001
Close. He's 11.

561
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:19,401
What? Really?

562
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:22,921
You said you owned a Porsche and that
your girlfriend was a supermodel.

563
00:46:22,922 --> 00:46:24,761
Yeah, I've got ambitions.

564
00:46:26,562 --> 00:46:30,561
Stay here and be nice, both of you.

565
00:46:34,362 --> 00:46:38,361
She got a boyfriend?

566
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:42,921
I'm just going to get some water
for us from the shop, OK?

567
00:46:54,162 --> 00:46:58,161
It's me. The manuscript exists.

568
00:46:58,922 --> 00:47:00,601
The boy.

569
00:47:00,602 --> 00:47:04,601
The boy knows where it is.

570
00:47:22,202 --> 00:47:26,201
Where is Jessica Hyde?

571
