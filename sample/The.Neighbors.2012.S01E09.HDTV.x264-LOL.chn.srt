1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,810
各位圣诞节快乐
Merry crap-mas, everyone.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,120
太无聊了
This sucks.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,150
好吧 孩子们
Okay, guys.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,960
我知道这个圣诞节没能按我们的计划进行
I know christmas didn't go exactly how we planned.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,180
我们的圣诞树下没有礼物
We don't have any presents under the tree.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,180
- 我们连树都没有 - 但是圣诞老人
- We don't have a tree. - But santa...

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,260
圣诞老人打电话过来说他今年不能来了
Santa called. He's not gonna be able to make it this year.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,050
但关键是 我们还在一起
But here's the thing... we have each other.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,760
我们又一起走过了一年 那才是真正重要的
We got through another year together, and that's what really matters.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,380
- 耶 没有人挂掉 - 真心圣诞快乐啊
- Yay, none of us died. - Merry christmas.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,350
所以我们这样 行吗
So this is what we're gonna do, okay?

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,770
我们下楼 然后充分享受这段时光
We're gonna go downstairs, and we are gonna make the best of this.

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,580
怎么样 走吧
All right? Let's go.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,540
动起来
Come on.

15
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,450
神赐福我们 各位
God bless us, every one!

16

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,770
你帮Max买了Ipad了吗 我想我们忘了买Ipad了
Did you get Max's Ipad? I think we forgot the Ipad.

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,840
我们没忘 就在这里
We didn't forget it. It's right there.

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,270
- 用蓝色包装纸包的这个 - 你确定那个装的是Ipad吗
- It's the blue wrapping paper. - Are you sure that's the Ipad?

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,250
亲爱的 你一般都会记得你给你8岁的孩子买了什么
Honey, you tend to remember something you bought your 8-year-old

21
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,160
如果你接下来三年都要为它分期还款的话
that you're gonna be paying for for the next three years.

22
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,790
好吧 我买了Amber的滑雪板 购物单上的东西买齐了
Okay, I got Amber's snowboard, and our list is officially complete.

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,770
其他的就交给圣诞老人了
The rest is up to Santa.

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,700
好嘞
Ho!

25
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,620
- 哈喽 - 嘿 你们好
- Hello! - Hey, guys!

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,270
怎么穿着围裙呢 在做饭吗
What's with the apron? You cooking something?

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,780
不 我只是喜欢它的修身功能
No. I just like what it does for my silhouette.

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,170
他超爱围裙的
He loves the apron.

29
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,490
是这样的 需要你们帮个小忙
So, guys, we need a small favor.

30
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,300
我们需要藏圣诞礼物的地方
We need a place to hide our christmas gifts.

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,200
我们有一窝嗅觉敏锐的孩子 然后
We got some nosy kids, and...

32
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,960
圣诞节耶 我一直都对这个感到兴奋不已的
Christmas! I've been so excited for this one!

33
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,230
哦 你们人类
Oh, you people.

34
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,290
所以说 我们对这个也不应该感到兴奋吗
So, we're not excited about this one, either?

35
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,310
- 他又要开始了 - 你是说我从3月起就一直听到的
- Here we go. - You mean the orgy of commercialism

36
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,380
商业狂欢么 我想不是
I've been hearing about since March? No.

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,260
我只是不明白两个相对理智的人类
I just don't see how two relatively sane human beings

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,290
会参与到这么不理智的节日中
can participate in such an insane holiday.

39
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,930
哦 这没有不理智 Larry 这给我们
Oh, it's not insane, Larry. It's fun for us,

40
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,460
和孩子们带来快乐 而且Abby现在6岁
and for the kids, and Abby's 6,

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,840
她还陷在圣诞的魔法之中无法自拔呢
and she still gets caught up in the magic of it all.

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,030
啊 又是这个 Abby 老是关于Abby
Ah, there it is. Abby. It's always about "Abby."

43
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,230
别在我女儿名字上加引号 Larry
Don't put my daughter in quotations, Larry.

44
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,430
那个小女孩有什么特别的吗 就我看来 一点都没有
What's so special about that little girl? Nothing, as far as I can see.

45
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,500
你们却编造了另一个借口
Yet you two have concocted yet another excuse

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,440
将一次性的商业垃圾
to lavish both her and the more worthwhile Weaver children

47
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,380
塞给她和Weaver家其他更好的孩子
with disposable commercial crap.

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,080
- Larry 你完全理解了 - 听着 圣诞节是一个家庭的事
- Larry, you've got it all wrong. - Okay, christmas is about family

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,370
是大家在一起欢笑 享受彼此的陪伴
and smiles and the joy of being together.

50
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,710
礼物只是个很小的部分
The gifts are just one tiny part of it.

51
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,590
哦 是啊 然后还有一个浑身是膘 邋里邋遢的入室窃贼
Oh, yes. And there's that fat, slovenly burglar

52
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,670
你们叫他作圣诞老人 说句心里话
you call Santa Claus. Honestly.

53
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,940
看在上帝份上 穿个围裙吧 胖子
Put on an apron for god's sake, fatso.

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,300
他和圣诞老人杠上了
He's struggling with Santa Claus.

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,530
当然你们可以把礼物放在我们这儿
Of course you can keep your presents here.

56
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,280
- 好的 绕到背后去 - 准备好了吗 亲爱的
- All right, get around back. - Ready, babe?

57
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,470
- 1... 2... - 小心上面
- 1... 2... - Watch the top.

58
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,830
- 推着你装满垃圾的手推车进来吧 - 我没事
- Wheel your barrow your full of crap... - I'm okay.

59
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,970
门 门
The door. The door.

60
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,600
掉下来了 掉下来了
Man down. Man down.

61
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,530
没事 好了 我接住了
All right. Yeah, we got it.

62
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,100
小心着点地板 那是竹制的
Just watch the floors. They're bamboo.

63
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,830
好的 没问题了
I got it. Yes. Okay.

64
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,900
怎么了
What's wrong?

65
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,730
你觉得Larry说的对吗 也许我们太在意于礼物了
Do you think Larry's right, and we're too caught up in the presents?

66
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,240
不 亲爱的 Larry那只是本性难移 懂吗
No, babe. Larry's just being Larry, okay?

67
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,610
我们的孩子知道圣诞节的意义
Our kids understand the meaning of christmas.

68
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,820
他们甚至不需要礼物
They don't even need presents.

69
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,200
嘿 老妈 确认下我的滑雪板是要有穿入式固定装置的 不是傻乎乎的搭扣式的
Hey, mom, make sure my snowboard has step-in bindings and not those lame straps.

70
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,010
那要看圣诞老人带来的是什么了
We'll see what Santa brings.

71
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,440
好吧 也用不着操心包装了
Yeah, uh, don't even worry about wrapping it.

72
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,200
那只会是浪费时间
It's just gonna slow me down.

73
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,190
还有 Jeremy打电话来 说是
Also, Jeremy called, and it turns out

74
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,120
我们那个滑雪旅行从圣诞后一天改到
we're going on the ski trip the day before christmas

75
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,030
圣诞前一天了 所以我要早点拿到礼物
instead of the day after, so I'm gonna need my presents early.

76
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,320
等一下 Amber
Hold up, Amber.

77
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,090
- 我们一家人要一起过这个圣诞节 - 是啊
- This family celebrates christmas together. - Yeah.

78
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,730
好 我会在山上给你们发短信的
Yeah. I'll text you from the mountain.

79
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,470
什么啊
What...

80
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,800
没事 我还在呢
Well, I'll be here.

81
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,740
我还想要些新Xbox游戏
And I want some new games for the Xbox.

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,960
等等 我还以为你要ipad
Wait. I thought you wanted an Ipad.

83
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,860
我都要 对了 我还想要辆新自行车
I'll multitask. Oh, and I also want a new bike.

84
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,610
一辆新的自行车 你呢
A new bike. What about you, huh?

85
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,360
你需要做些改动吗
You have any changes you'd like to make?

86
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,110
不麻烦了 Santa知道我想要什么 他会准备好的
Nah. Santa knows what I want. He'll take care of me.

87
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,280
对了 这是我新的愿望清单
Oh, and, uh, here's my new list.

88
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,770
我把有变动的地方特别标出来了
I've highlighted the changes.

89
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,630
一定要注意看第三页
Be sure to look at page 3.

90
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,600
第三页
Page 3.

91
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,930
你应该发传真给圣诞老人 时间不多了
You should probably fax it. It's getting pretty late.

92
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,890
好的 我就去 谢谢
Okay, I'll get on that. Thank you.

93
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,800
天啊 怎么回事 这难道是宪法吗
God! What the hell? Is this the constitution?

94
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,280
谁会给圣诞节礼物单写修正案啊
Who makes amendments to a christmas list?

95
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,650
你知道吗 你说的没错
You know what? You're right.

96
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,930
他们只在乎圣诞礼物 孩子们都疯了
It's become all about this stuff. Our kids are completely out of control.

97
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,600
我恨他们三个熊孩子 Marty
I hated all three of them just now, Marty.

98
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,780
那一刻 我恨他们三个
In that moment, I hated all three of our children.

99
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,270
嘿
You know what?

100
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,320
也许我们今年可以过个与众不同的圣诞
Maybe we should try something different this year.

101
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,710
别管那些礼物了
Forget the presents.

102
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,430
我们去哪儿度个假吧
Let's take a nice vacation somewhere

103
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,000
和家人一起过圣诞节
and hang with the family for christmas.

104
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,860
去个好点的地方 去热带的某个地方
Somewhere nice. Maybe somewhere tropical.

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,100
不错 但我们去不起热带啊
Yeah, but we can't afford tropical.

106
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,270
买那堆礼物花了一大笔钱呢
We just spent a buttload of money on all their presents.

107
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,300
我们把礼物退掉 拿这笔钱去旅游
No! We return the presents and we use the money for the trip!

108
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,060
- 我们可以这么做吗 - 我们可是家长
- Can we do that? - We're the parents.

109
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,880
我们可是给这帮贪心的小妖孽取名字的人
We named those greedy little monsters.

110
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,460
- 我们想怎样就怎样 - 我的天
- We can do whatever we want! - Oh, my god!

111
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,890
我们可以在圣诞节晒成古铜色了
We could have christmas tans.

112
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,350
超级碗的时候我就是古铜色的啦
I'm gonna be brown for the super bowl!

113
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,740
看看这一大堆实体化了的消费主义
Look at this bloated pile of consumerism.

114
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,930
大部分还都是给那个小姑娘的
And most of it for that little girl.

115
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,270
她是什么情况 她真有这么可爱吗
What's her deal? Is she really that cute?

116
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,300
老公 她可可爱了
She is pretty cute, husband.

117
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,440
老爸 她可以说是我见过的最可爱的小孩了
Dad, she's pretty much the cutest kid ever.

118
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,520
她还一直在掉牙
And her teeth keep on falling out of her face.

119
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,380
接下来要掉什么 鼻子么
What's gonna fall off next, her nose?

120
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,930
老爸 我超爱听你吐槽小孩子的
Oh, father! I love it when you make fun of children.

121
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,370
这一切都很可笑
The whole thing is ridiculous. I mean,

122
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,130
什么东西能长成这样
what could possibly be this shape,

123
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,040
还让收到的人觉得很高兴呢
and yet be so exciting to receive?

124
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,190
刚刚不是在反问 我是真的在问问题
No, really. It's not a rhetorical question.

125
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,340
- 你觉得这是什么 - 它看起来像一块巨大的板
- What do you think it is? - It looks like a giant board,

126
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,010
可能是某种冬季运动用的
perhaps for some sort of, um, winter sport.

127
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,640
别傻了 Reggie
Don't be a dolt, Reggie.

128
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,330
到底是什么惊喜
What's the surprise?

129
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,370
我和你们的爸爸经过讨论
Well, your dad and I were talking,

130
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,200
决定今年要过一个与往年不同的圣诞节
And we decided to do christmas a little different this year.

131
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,510
提前发礼物 不
Presents early? No.

132
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,180
我们可以过犹太式圣诞然后连着八天拿礼物吗
Can we do jewish christmas and get presents for eight days?

133
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,330
不不 我们决定今年不发礼物了 改成
What? No. We decided that instead of presents this year...

134
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,460
全家去旅游
We're going on a family trip!

135
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,510
我们没有在开玩笑
We're not joking.

136
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,420
他们没有在开玩笑
They're not joking!

137
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,000
你们没有在开玩笑吗
You're not joking?

138
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,020
你们在玩什么烂把戏
What kind of sick game are you playing?

139
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,920

我们还只是孩子呢
We're just children!

140
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,240
也许这是一只加拉帕戈斯群岛上的陆龟 它的壳是平的
Perhaps it's a galapagos turtle with a flattened shell.

141
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,760
一把巨型枪
A giant stick of gum?

142
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,300
好吧 再问一下 为什么我们这么快就把滑雪板否定了
Okay, one more time, why are we so quick to dismiss snowboard?

143
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,020
哦我的天
Oh, my.

144
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,010
这感觉实在太好了
Oh, that felt really, really good.

145
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,510
太美妙了
It's beautiful.

146
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,570
- 老公 这是什么 - 这是 这是
- What is it, husband? - It's a... it's... it's...

147
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,530
这是一样东西
It's a thing.

148
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,650
- 它美妙极了 - 它就像它看起来那么好玩吗
- And it's glorious. - Okay, was that as fun as it looked?

149
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,850
也许更好玩
Even better.

150
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,710
- 我想要 - 我也要
- I want one! - Me, too!

151
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,830
没问题 人人有份
Yes! Presents for everyone!

152
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,790
我拿到了自行车 真棒
I got a bike! Cool!

153
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,920
圣诞节最棒了
Christmas is the best thing ever!

154
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,110
耶
Yeah!

155
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,000
所以今年圣诞节没有礼物了
So no presents for christmas this year?

156
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,490
很好 你们毁了圣诞节 一年中唯一一个我认为这个家庭还可以忍受的日子
Great. You've ruined the one day a year I actually find this family tolerable.

157
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,890
我们说清楚
So just to be clear,

158
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,300
我一整年都很乖
I've been good all year,

159
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,140
我却要和她归在一起么
and I'm getting lumped in with her?

160
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,640
好吧 我猜全家旅行也挺有意思
Well, I guess a trip for the family sounds fun.

161
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,970
哦 闭嘴 马屁精
Oh, zip it, kiss-ass.

162
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,160
你说过我可以和Jeremy一起去旅行
You already told me I could go on a trip with Jeremy.

163
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,510
好吧 我觉得我们都忘记了圣诞节的真正意义
Okay. I think we've all lost sight of what christmas is really about.

164
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,900
意义不在于礼物
It is not about presents.

165
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,810
而在于团聚
It's about being together,

166
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,050
我们要全家一起出动 所有人一起
and we are gonna go away as a family, all of us.

167
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,080
这是不是意味着我们得把给你们的礼物退回呢
Does this mean we have to return the presents we got for you?

168
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,670
你给我们买了礼物
You got us presents?

169
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,610
当然没有 但你知道那是什么感觉了
Of course not, but do you see how that feels?

170
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,070
妈妈 我很困惑
Mommy, I'm confused.

171
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,900
我在购物中心看到圣诞老人了
I saw Santa at the mall,

172
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,660
他说我今年很乖
and he said I was very good this year,

173
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,510
我会得到想要的一切
and I would be getting everything I asked for.

174
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,940
哦 别担心 亲爱的
Well, don't worry about that, sweetie,

175
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,270
因为爸爸今早一直在和圣诞老人发短信 猜猜说了什么
because daddy was texting back and forth with Santa this morning, and guess what?

176
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,420
-他批准了我们的旅行  -知道么 这很有趣
- He approved our trip!  - You know what? That's interesting,

177
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,970
因为在你与圣诞老人发完短信后 我还和他视频来着
Because I was skype-ing with Santa after you finished texting with him,

178
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,180
他说我可以和我的朋友一起去滑雪行
and he said that I could go on a ski trip with my friends.

179
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,490
什么
What?

180
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,840
我也认识圣诞老人
I know Santa, too.

181
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,190
好吧 你知道么 鬼灵精
All right. You know what, smart-mouth?

182
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,620
让我声明一下
Let me be really clear.

183
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,740
你不许去什么滑雪行
You are not going on your ski trip.

184
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,740
真逊
So lame.

185
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,830
来吧 伙计们 回房间吧 趁他们没把房间也收走
Come on, guys. Let's go to our rooms before they take those away, too.

186
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,190
能再提醒我下么 为什么想要与这些孩子在岛上独处
Can you remind me again why want to be alone on island with these children?

187
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,970
这圣诞电影真是个精彩的故事
That Christmas movie is a wonderful story.

188
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,600
我爱这个幽灵
I love the ghost.

189
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,430
同意 尽管我不喜欢小Tim
Agreed. Although I didn't like tiny Tim.

190
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,780
小只 诡异 完全不搭情节
Little, weird, and totally unrelatable.

191
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,560
我承认 我对圣诞节的看法错了
I admit it. I was wrong about christmas.

192
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,870
这是个可爱的节日
It's a lovely holiday.

193
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,870
这些东西 树啦 雪啦
The things, the trees, the snow.

194
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,990
那些东西
The things.

195
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,360
圣诞节充满魔力 父亲 魔力
Christmas is magical, father! Magical!

196
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,940
Dick Dick 伸直你的膝盖
Dick, Dick, fix your joints.

197
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,400
你会肚子痛的
You're going to get a bellyache.

198
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,070
但我还是无法对圣诞老人那个家伙释怀
I still can't get past that Santa fellow, though.

199
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,450
5.26亿儿童庆祝圣诞节
526 million children celebrate christmas.

200
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,300
意味着他每小时要送礼物
That means he has to deliver presents

201
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,040
给2200万儿童
to 22 million children an hour.

202
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,110
我是说 真的
I mean, really!

203
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,110
我们假设他在一晚上就环游世界
I mean, we're saying he gets around the whole world in one night...

204
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,640
还胖成那样
at that weight.

205
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,920
我说 他都挤不进雪橇了
I mean, he can't fit into a sleigh,

206
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,470
更别说驾雪橇飞了
Let alone fly in one.

207
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,540
抱歉 我知道跑题了
I'm sorry. I know this is off topic,

208
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,480
但是这玩意我穿对了吧
but is anyone gonna admit that I got this right?

209
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,190
没有
No.

210
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,830
要不然
Tell you what.

211
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,560
我们再看一遍 圣诞颂歌木偶剧
Let's watch "The Muppets: A christmas carol" again.

212
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,230
我喜欢木偶
The Muppets I like.

213
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,020
我还能学得很像
I could really get down with the muppets.

214
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,070
Kermit
Kermit.

215
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,220

非常好

220
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,130
哦 我找好了 Marty 看这个
Oh, I got it, Marty. Look at this...

221
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,550
享受夏威夷时光 可预订
"available time-share in hawaii.

222
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,600
三间卧室 新潮厨房 海滩步行可及 装有坐浴盆
"three bedrooms, updated kitchen,
short walk to the beach, bidet"!

223
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,840
传说中洗屁屁的玩意
The tushie-squirting thing?

224
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,550
天哪 他们还有专门洗屁屁的浴盆
Holy crap, they have the tushie-squirting thing!

225
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,350
等下 等下 我们预算够吗
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Can we afford this?

226
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,220
在我们的接受范围内 Marty 就是它了
It's in our price range. Marty, this is ours!

227
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,080
我们可以的 我们要去夏威夷
We can do this! We're going to hawaii!

228
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,620
-是的  -我们去拿礼物再退回去
- Yeah! - Oh, let's go get the gifts and return them

229
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,570
-这样我们就能付得起了  -我的屁股已经感觉到潮湿了
- so we can pay for this thing. - My tushie feels wet already.

230
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,970
祝我圣诞快乐
Merry christmas to me.

231
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,380
之前我真是大错特错了
I have never been so wrong about anything in my life.

232
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,970
我爱圣诞节
I love christmas!

233
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,850
Larry 你出什么事了
Larry, what the hell is the matter with you?

234
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,100
自来在这蠢星球上起 第一次没出事
For the first time on this stupid planet, nothing.

235
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,030
我沉浸在快乐中 脑海里充满了甜蜜
I'm totally joyous. I have sugarplums in my head!

236
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,710
怎么 你出什么事了
Why? What's the matter with you?

237
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,410
你应该帮我们看管好礼物
You were supposed to hold on to our gifts

238
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,280
管几天 而不把它们送掉
for a few days, not give them away!

239
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,720
-也不是摧毁它们  -圣诞快乐
- Or destroy 'em! - Merry christmas!

240
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,150
我不敢相信居然发生了这种事
I can't believe this is happening.

241
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,440
说实话 我觉得你们做事完全不靠谱
To be honest, I think you're being completely illogical

242
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,130
就像龌龊的小妖精
and a bit of a nasty elf.

243
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,430
你说过 圣诞节就是给予
You said christmas is about giving.

244
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
我不会让你毁了我的圣诞节 绝不会
I won't let you ruin christmas for me. I just won't!

245
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,150
你说什么 我们毁了你的圣诞节
I'm sorry. We're ruining your christmas?!

246
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,290
你把我们的礼物送了出去
You gave our gifts away!

247
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,540
那些外星人为什么在玩我们的礼物
Why are the aliens playing with our presents?

248
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,390
他们是在扔我的Ipad吗
Are they throwing my Ipad?

249
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,970
Jackie 这回真是惹大祸了
Jackie, this is a major screw-up.

250
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,930
哦 不 又来了
Oh, no, not again.

251
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,290
你们真是有太多节日能让我们糟蹋了
It's just that you have so many holidays　for us to screw up.

252
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,130
我们能不能直接跳到一切完美结局以后
Can't we just get to the part　where everything ends up being all right

253
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,980
我们开始相互学习的那一部分
and we learn　from one another?

254
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,120
-不能那样吗  -Jackie 我们攒了一年的钱才买到这些
- Can't we do that?　- Jackie, we save up all year for this.

255
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,240
可现在它们退不掉了 我们还要用退款去夏威夷呢
And now we can't return those gifts and use the money to go to hawaii!

256
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,880
真的很抱歉 我的丈夫不是故意
I'm so sorry. My husband didn't mean...

257
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,880
不要再替他道歉了 Jackie
Stop apologizing for him, Jackie.

258
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,910
你不能每次都替他犯的错道歉
You can't keep apologizing for him every time he makes a mistake

259
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,050
然后就不了了之
and expect everything to be better.

260
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,990
史上最糟圣诞节
Worst christmas ever!

261
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,570
期待一整年的一天就这么给搞砸了
Whole year of being good right down the crapper!

262
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,190
你真淘气 Bird先生
I'm afraid you've been naughty, Mr. Bird.

263
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,200
圣诞老人知道你什么时候调皮
And Santa knows when you've been naughty,

264
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,940
什么时候很乖
and he knows when you've been nice.

265
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,320
他知道健身房在哪儿吗
Does he know where the gym is?

266
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,420
因为他就快要因糖尿病截肢了
Because he's going to lose a foot to diabetes.

267
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,620
你好啊 我不起眼的小朋友
Hello, my little overlooked friend.

268
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,570
丈夫 我觉得我们真的犯了大错了
Husband, I think we've made a terrible mistake.

269
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,860
我们确实犯了大错了 我们漏了一个 哇
You bet your sweet bippy we did. We missed one. Ohh!

270
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,010
-全新Ipad  -丈夫
- The new Ipad! - Husband.

271
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,050
哦 没什么大不了的 那些东西
Oh, it's fine. It's just stuff

272
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,610
他们本来玩没两天就会腻的
They would have got bored with within a day or two.

273
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,500
但这个例外 乔布斯这个做的真是太赞了
But not this. Steve jobs really got it right with this one.

274
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,460
Larry Bird Weaver一家对我们一直都很好
Larry Bird! The Weavers have been so good to us,

275
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,740
可我们总是让他们失望
and we keep on disappointing them.

276
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,200
我们得弥补我们的错误
We have to make this right.

277
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,010
你要是不行动 那么我来
Either you do it, or I will.

278
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,130
等等 Jackie 你想要我做什么呢
Wait, Jackie.What do you want from me?

279
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,370
你是不是想要我送点花给他们  那样行吗
Do you want me to send them some flowers? Is that it?

280
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,560
Siri 我真的毁了他们的圣诞了吗
Siri, did I really ruin their christmas?

281
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,650
Siri
Siri?

282
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,780
我都不知道是怎样发生的
I don't even know how it happened.

283
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,510
只是看见那满地的包装纸和礼盒
Just seeing all that wrapping paper and boxes...

284
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,070
我知道你不会原谅我们了
I know you can't ever forgive us,

285
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,130
但是我们真的 真的为我们所做的一切感到很抱歉
but we are truly, truly sorry for what we did.

286
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,050
Jackie 你想要我说什么
Jackie, what do you want me to say?

287
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,060
我知道你们不是故意要伤害我们
I know you didn't mean to hurt us.

288
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,810
你们只是兴奋过头了 我了解
You guys got carried away.I get it.

289
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,300
你们在庆祝你们第一个圣诞
You celebrated your first christmas.

290
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,090
第一次总是最美好的
The first ones are always the best ones.

291
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,510
甚至对Amber也是
Even Amber.

292
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,810
她小时候过圣诞时 满脸都是甜蜜的兴奋
She had the sweetest look of excitement on her face her first few christmases.

293
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,250
每当她对我说出伤人的话时 我就回想那些记忆
I hang on to that memory when she says hurtful things to me.

294
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,110
呜
Ooh.

295
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,260
我猜你每天一定要回忆好多次
I imagine you must think of that several times a day.

296
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,600
是啊 是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

297
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,050
你想干什么
What do you want?

298
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,850
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

299
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,220
随着孩子们一天天长大
With the kids all getting older,

300
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,050
我们很担心这是一家人一起迎接美妙早晨的
we were afraid that this was gonna be the last christmas where we'd have

301
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,290
最后一个圣诞节了
one of those magical mornings together.

302
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,170
Marty和我只是情难自已了
Marty and I just got carried away.

303
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,990
所以这次我们真的干坏事了
So we really screwed your pooch on this one.

304
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,020
噢 Jackie 你们不只是毁了这个圣诞
Oh, Jackie. Not only did you screw my pooch,

305
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,940
还深深伤了我们的心
but you didn't call her the next day, either.

306
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,260
这 很好喝
It's... Very good.

307
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,680
谢谢你
Thank you.

308
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,150
我一直在观察你
I've been watching you.

309
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,210
我看得出 你很难过
And I can tell you're sad.

310
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,950
所以我过来是想告诉你不要难过了
So I came over to tell you not to be sad,

311
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,200
因为圣诞老人会让一切都好起来的
cause Santa's going to make everything all better.

312
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,330
圣诞老人会让一切都好起来的
Santa's going to make everything all better.

313
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,770
我4岁的时候得了流感
When I was 4, I got the flu,

314
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,350
因此不能去见圣诞老人
So I coun't visit Santa.

315
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,430
我妈妈叫我写封信
So my mom told me to write a letter

316
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,130
她可以帮我在圣诞前寄给圣诞老人
so she could mail it to him before christmas.

317
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,440
从那以后 我一直在担心圣诞老人会把我忘了
The whole time, I was really worried that he had forgotten about me.

318
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,580
-可你猜怎么着  -怎么了
- But guess what? - What?

319
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,200
他给我回信了
He wrote me back.

320
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,940
噢 拜托
Oh, please.

321
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,560
他写了点啥
What did he write?

322
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,580
他要我即使在没人的时候 也要乖乖的
He reminded me to be good even when no one was watching,

323
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,280
永远不要忘记圣诞节的真谛
and to never forget what christmas is all about.

324
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,310
那是啥
What's that?

325
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,200
家人啊 白痴
Family, silly.

326
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,920
圣诞老人 这么跟你说的?
Santa... told you that?

327
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,560
所以别哭丧着脸了 Bird先生
So no more sad faces, Mr. Bird,

328
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,960
因为圣诞老人会让明天更美好的
'cause Santa's going to make everything all better.

329
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,350
他总会把问题解决的
He always comes through.

330
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,110
感谢您的款待 希望日后还有机会一起喝茶
Thank you for the tea. Let's do it again sometime.

331
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,250
哦 天啊
Oh, dear.

332
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,660
我真的是 真的太不懂事了
I've been very, very naughty.

333
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,900
天啊 你又想怎样
Oh, goodness. What are you up to now?

334
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,020
你是对的 老婆
You were right, wife.

335
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,030
Weaver一家一直对我们很好
The Weavers have been good to us,

336
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,860
所以我要补救这一切
so I'm going to make this right.

337
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,060
我要成为圣诞老爷爷 给他们一个完美的圣诞节
I'm going to be like Santa Claus and save their christmas.

338
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,870
我现在需要一个小精灵帮手 衣服我都已经准备好了
All I need is a helper elf. I've already made the costume.

339
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,540
噢 老公 你太棒了啦
Oh, husband, love of my life,

340
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,230
我永远是你的小精灵
I would be your elf any day.

341
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,950
快别傻了 你太高了
Don't be ridiculous. You're too tall.

342
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,130
我对事情的下一步发展甚为忧虑
Oh, I do not like where this is going.

343
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,630
我钱多的没处花 我想买辆车
I have a limitless amount cash and desire to buy a car.

344
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,240
头奖哎
Jackpot.

345
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,550
不好意思 你这个圣诞有什么计划么
Excuse me. Do you have any plans this christmas?

346
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,290
喔 我家人都死光了
Oh, my family's all dead.

347
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,010
太好了
Perfect.

348
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,220
完胜
Boo-yah!

349
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,400
抓住它 快跑儿子
Kept it. Move rapid, son.

350
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,230
抓住那只圣诞小猪
Capture the christmas swine!

351
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,570
抓最好看的那只
Get the pretty one!

352
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,470
- 剩蛋快乐 各位   - 好无聊啊
- Merry crap-mas, everyone.   - This sucks.

353
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,660
好了 伙计们
Okay, guys.

354
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,560
我知道圣诞和我们想象中的不太一样
I know christmas didn't go exactly how we planned.

355
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,050
- 圣诞树下没有礼物   - 我们连树都没有
- We don't have any presents under the tree.   - We don't have a tree.

356
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,830
我们现在这么办
So this is what we're gonna do, okay?

357
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,420
我们一起下楼
We're gonna go downstairs,

358
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,470
努力过个开心的圣诞节
and we are gonna make the best of this.

359
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,120
好吗  走吧
All right? Let's go.

360
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,170
来吧
Come on.

361
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,250
走
Come on.

362
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,840
上帝保佑我们
God bless us, every one!

363
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,030
圣诞快乐 Weaver一家
Merry christmas, Weavers!

364
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,300
这是个什么情况
What the heck is going on?

365
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,990
我们知道你想要一个完美的圣诞节
Well, we know you wanted the perfect christmas...

366
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,360
我们知道你们想去夏威夷
and we know you wanted to go to hawaii,

367
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,090
所以我们让你们二者兼得了
so we decided to give you both.

368
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,450
信不信由你 这是Larry Bird的主意
Believe it or not, it was Larry Bird's idea.

369
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,590
Larry人呢
Where is Larry?

370
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,140
哈 哈 哈
Ho, ho, ho!

371
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,330
我知道孩子们今年的圣诞礼物
I understand your children had a bit of a mishap

372
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,290
出了点小意外
with their presents this year.

373
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,550
这是临时通知的 但是我也能拿到他们单子上关键的几样哦
It was short notice, but I was able to get the key items on their lists.

374
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,920
来 大家现在都到树跟前 我们把烛台点燃
Now gather 'round the tree, let's light up the menorah,

375
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,920
我们会举行宽扎庆典 直到午夜
and we'll kwanzaa till the break of dawn.

376
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,140
来看看有什么
Check it out.

377
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,850
我和你爸都知道 你特别想和朋友们去滑雪
Your dad and I know how badly you wanted to go snowboarding with your friends...

378
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,350
- 是滑雪   - 啥
- Snowboarding!   - Wh...

379
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,500
这么办吧
So here's the deal.

380
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,980
你现在如果马上去收拾你的东西
If you can be packed and ready to go in a couple hours,

381
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,310
我一会儿就开车送你去
I will personally drive you there myself.

382
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,550
你在开玩笑嘛
Are you kidding me?

383
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,570
错过这场大闹剧嘛 不可能的事儿
And miss this insanity? There's absolutely no way.

384
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,270
这么多年 我终于看到了这张在圣诞节应该出现的笑脸
There's the christmas face I've been hanging on to for all these years.

385
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,950
你欠我一个滑雪板
You owe me a snowboard.

386
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,060
你说这句话我还勉强能接受
And there's the one I've learned to accept.

387
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,130
我听说你想要一个新的平板电脑
Now, I hear you wanted the new ipad.

388
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,020
天啊 谢谢啦
Gee, thanks.

389
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,020
无线网络有点问题
The wi-fi's a bit spotty.

390
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,410
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

391
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,300
我只知道你是外星人
I knew you were an alien,

392
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,920
可我不知道原来你也是圣诞老人
but I didn't know you were also Santa Claus.

393
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,810
我不是真的
Oh, I'm not real...

394
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,010
别告诉其他人
Don't tell anyone.
