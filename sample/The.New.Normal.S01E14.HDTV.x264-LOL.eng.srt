1
00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:08,130
Oh, good, you're doing nothing.

2
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:09,465
I'm watching the playoffs.

3
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:10,516
That's what you said
last Sunday.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,600
Hey...

5
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:13,335
Anyway, I've been kicking
around some ideas

6
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:14,687
for birth announcements.

7
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:17,306
I just need you to sign off
on one more thing.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,359
I'm sure whatever you want
is fine, it's...

9
00:00:21,862 --> 00:00:23,562
What the hell is that?

10
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:26,315
It's his wardrobe for the
christening announcement photo.

11
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:29,068
Oh, no.

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,853
My son is not wearing that.

13
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:33,188
Oh, no, no, no... if you're
afraid it's derivative,

14
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:34,356
it is intentionally so.

15
00:00:34,374 --> 00:00:35,958
It is modeled after
Lucy Harker's funeral gown

16
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:38,077
from Francis Ford Coppola's
<i>Dracula.</i>

17
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:40,713
Good eye, David. My son is
not wearing a dress, Bryan.

18
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:42,031
It is not a dress.

19
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:44,366
It is a classic turn of
the century dressing gown.

20
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:46,719
They were very common infant
attire and a lot of parents

21
00:00:46,753 --> 00:00:48,587
still use them in birth
and christening announcements.

22
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:50,222
I'm just kind of hoping
to get to his first birthday

23
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:51,557
without him being
called "a baby homo."

24
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:53,809
Who would call an infant
"a baby homo"

25
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:56,228
except for a toddler
Michele Bachmann?

26
00:00:56,263 --> 00:00:59,732
David, clothes do not
define what somebody is.

27
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:01,434
I mean, look at me.

28
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:02,885
If you had to pick what
my sexuality was

29
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:04,770
based on what I was wearing,
what would you say?

30
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:06,655
Lesbian bagger vance.

31
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,891
I love the way you dress,
I'm just saying we have

32
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,110
to be careful about what kind
of impression we put out there.

33
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:13,045
Meaning what? Meaning that
people make snap judgments

34
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,229
based on appearances

35
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:16,165
and it could affect him
for the rest of his life.

36
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:18,918
Fine, if you don't
like my idea,

37
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:20,336
come up with one of your own.

38
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:25,735
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

39
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:30,079
Hello.

40
00:01:30,097 --> 00:01:31,580
Welcome.

41
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:33,682
Jane Forrest,
exquisite properties

42
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:34,767
for appropriate buyers.

43
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,752
My God, it's dead in here.

44
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,938
It's more like
a haunted open house.

45
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,557
And you must be
one of the ghosts.

46
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:42,808
Judging by your outfit,

47
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:44,777
I'd say you died around
the time <i>argo</i> was set.

48
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:46,896
I am dressed as what I am,

49
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,647
which is a damn good
real estate agent.

50
00:01:48,698 --> 00:01:50,649
Now, are you here
to view the property

51
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,785
or just to air out those
dazzling new tooth caps

52
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,954
of yours?
Oh, relax Janey, I'm Brice.

53
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:56,622
Nancy Niles' broker associate.

54
00:01:56,656 --> 00:01:59,274
She sent me here to check out
your first open house.

55
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:01,961
Let's see.

56
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:05,047
You see that? I just...
I just cruised myself.

57
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,332
I am literally a Greek God.

58
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:07,616
Tell me, does this

59
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:09,218
pant make my package
look too big?

60
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:12,471
Certainly pales in comparison
to the size of your ego.

61
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:14,006
Now, thank you
very much, price...

62
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:17,009
Brice... as in Dallas Howard.

63
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,310
So, Jane, tell me.

64
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,062
Where'd you get your start
in real estate?

65
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,347
Ohio.
Right.

66
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:22,631
And I bet the smell

67
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:23,632
of these cookies baked
fresh from a tube

68
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,900
is your secret weapon?

69
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,435
Yes.
No.

70
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:28,637
See, here in L.A. it's just
a reminder of your client's

71
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:29,805
eating disorder, but see

72
00:02:29,823 --> 00:02:31,323
that is not what's
driving people

73
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:32,474
away from your open house.

74
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:34,827
Okay, I'll bite...
what is?

75
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:37,613
Well, we could quickly slap
on a fresh coat of paint,

76
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:41,534
but I think the real problem
lies within the foundation.

77
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:44,486
I mean, the whole design scheme
is so tacky and outdated.

78
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:47,289
Are you insane? We can't
flip an entire house.

79
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:50,292
Keep up with me, honey... I'm
not talking about the house.

80
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:52,211
I'm flipping you.

81
00:02:52,262 --> 00:02:54,329
It was so nice
meeting you, Shania.

82
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:55,548
I hope you had fun
on the set tour,

83
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,433
though I don't normally

84
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:59,001
give it myself. (Laughs)

85
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,586
There are special
privileges that come

86
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,605
with being the kid of
my boss's surrogate.

87
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,356
You don't have any more
children, do you?

88
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,274
Oh, no.

89
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:06,842
Okay, see you guys later.

90
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,511
Hey, girls, hate to interrupt
but picture's up in ten

91
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:11,363
and our star needs
to be touched up.

92
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,115
Oily faces don't
powder themselves.

93
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,116
No, they don't.

94
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:15,734
Bye.

95
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:19,038
Oh, how do I look?

96
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:20,039
Great.

97
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:21,407
Is there something in my teeth?

98
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,358
How's my breath?
Did you eat bologna?

99
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:25,360
That's Chris.

100
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:26,361
He's a grip.

101
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,963
What's a grip?
Got me.

102
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:28,964
We have a bit of a thing going.

103
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,083
Oh, um, what about Darnell?

104
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:33,469
I thought you guys
were hot and heavy.

105
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:35,337
Well, when things got intimate,
Darnell kept taking

106
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:37,223
the bus downtown,
which I do like,

107
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:39,141
but he never got off
at the right stop.

108
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:41,644
He kept taking it all
the way to skid row.

109
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:43,596
I couldn't look him
in the eye anymore,

110
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,314
you know what I'm saying?
Not at all.

111
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:47,766
Hey, baby girl.
Hey.

112
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:49,902
Hey. Kisses...
mm-wah, mm-wah.

113
00:03:49,936 --> 00:03:52,721
Two things... number one,
you look stupid fierce.

114
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,890
Number two, we have
a date... Mary J. Blige

115
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:57,610
is playing at the Nokia,
no is not an option, and...

116
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:58,894
No more drama.

117
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:00,663
(Both laughing)

118
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:02,998
Aren't you gonna introduce me
to these two lovely ladies?

119
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,166
Oh, Chris, these
are my friends.

120
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:05,668
This is Goldie and Shania.

121
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:07,569
I bet you break boys' hearts
left and right.

122
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:09,071
Don't you know it, girlfriend?

123
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:10,839
We should go out
boy-hunting sometime.

124
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:13,842
Goldie (Laughs):
Isn't she precocious?

125
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:15,010
She taught me that word
when she was four.

126
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,545
Yeah, well,
I better get back to work.

127
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,630
I got a jib arm to rig.

128
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,635
What was that, saying
you want to go hunting

129
00:04:22,686 --> 00:04:24,253
for boys with my boyfriend?

130
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:25,521
Rocky, I was kidding.

131
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:27,139
I'm too young
to get into gay bars.

132
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,224
(Bell rings)

133
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:29,858
Man:
All right, picture's up.

134
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:34,196
Okay, we want
to upgrade her look.

135
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:36,065
But I don't want
anything crazy.

136
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:37,132
Crazy is what you've got, girl.

137
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,267
Brice:
I know, it's so

138
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:41,392
***

139
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:44,266
- ***
- ***

140
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:48,464
***

141
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:49,921
It looks hot on my wife.

142
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,591
It's easy to wear
it down for work.

143
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:54,628
Or tie it up for chasing
our kids around the house.

144
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,963
Hairstylist: I say we do
some subtle layering.

145
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:59,132
Something to highlight
your great jaw line.

146
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:02,135
Natasha, I never noticed
how soft you hair is.

147
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,254
Don't let me leave without
the name of your conditioner.

148
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:05,439
And your phone number.

149
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,140
(Laughs)

150
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,425
What are you doing?

151
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:10,644
Hopefully getting her number.

152
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:12,262
And it's a game?

153
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,231
Oh, sweetheart, it's
definitely a game.

154
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:15,949
Uh-huh, to what end?

155
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,534
To what...
I don't know.

156
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,454
Go to dinner, a movie,
or see where the night takes us.

157
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:23,206
I have a boat.

158
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,708
Are you even thinking about her?

159
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,209
What about her feelings?

160
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:27,461
What if she likes you?

161
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,279
Is it the fumes in here?

162
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:31,715
I know rayburn uses a
two-step emulsifying bleach.

163
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,467
Please, I know you, Brice.

164
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:36,053
I was married to a man
just like you.

165
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,839
And I think you are cruel
and you are selfish.

166
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,724
And if you were
a decent human being,

167
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,309
you would leave
that young girl alone

168
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,894
and stick to your own kind.

169
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,512
What's my own kind?

170
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:47,647
Gay.
I'm not gay.

171
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:50,016
Oh, please,
you are wearing a bracelet.

172
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:52,152
Jane, it's a new world.

173
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,820
Just because a guy's
into fashion and culture

174
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,856
and hair processing
doesn't make him gay.

175
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:57,074
Hear, hear.

176
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:00,077
Oh...

177
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,312
I mean,
what is David's problem?

178
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,997
That's a perfectly lovely gown

179
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,749
for a boy or a girl.

180
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,702
Um, I think I might have to
side with David on this one.

181
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,538
It's a little... girly?

182
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,823
Well, so what? I mean,
clothing doesn't necessarily

183
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,425
have to indicate gender.

184
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,044
Right, but, um...
Most people aren't that evolved.

185
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:19,379
They go with their
first impressions

186
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,663
and sometimes that can hurt.

187
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,499
(Knocking on door)

188
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,168
I need to talk to the child.

189
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,938
Child, you have lost your damn

190
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:32,008
stinking mind suggesting that my
boyfriend Chris is a homosexual.

191
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:34,861
Oh, so he's secretly gay,
but dates women as a cover?

192
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,196
You know, on the down low?

193
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,065
What? The down low?

194
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:41,518
My man is on the up high...
he is straight.

195
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:42,986
I'm sure you think he is, Rocky,

196
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,739
but my gaydar
is pretty impeccable.

197
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,630
Yes, miss Shania?

198
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,632
Diego, I wanted to tell you.

199
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,051
Despite how difficult it
must be in your community

200
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,503
to proudly declare who you are,

201
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:00,587
I know.

202
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:01,671
<i>¿Cómo?</i>

203
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:03,640
I know the hanky
in your left pocket

204
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,091
is part of the gay hanky code.

205
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:08,895
Well, I just, uh, use it to wipe
my sweat when I trim the bushes.

206
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,046
Okay, we'll go with that.

207
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,932
Here, I got you this.

208
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:13,817
It's Bryan's screener
for <i>Les Miz.</i>

209
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,437
Maybe you know someone
who'd enjoy watching it.

210
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:23,577
I just know on, like,
a molecular level.

211
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,862
Sorry, Rocky, but Chris is gay.

212
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:30,033
Ooh, Jane, what's with
the scarf? Chemo?

213
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,751
My hair is not thinning,

214
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,203
if that's what you're implying.

215
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:35,755
Why is Rocky sweating?

216
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,041
Oh, well, Shania accused
Rocky's boyfriend

217
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:39,876
of being gay...
Which he is not.

218
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,179
And we were just, uh,
clearing up the situation.

219
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,247
I am going through
this exact same thing

220
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:45,515
with this fellow at work.

221
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,083
Well, it's not as easy
to tell who's gay

222
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,518
and who's straight anymore.

223
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,270
If I'm confused, I can't imagine
how you straights feel.

224
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,471
Well, Chris is straight.

225
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:52,772
Well, your not-gay,

226
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:53,807
gay boyfriend can't be

227
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:55,025
any gayer than gay Brice.

228
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,309
Why do you even care?

229
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,311
I need to find out if I
should like him or hate him.

230
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:00,197
And make him deal
with his life choices

231
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,698
so he doesn't hurt
innocent women.

232
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:02,782
Like me.

233
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,317
Ooh, what if we have a dinner,

234
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:05,952
and then we can put these guys

235
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,871
to a gay test...
like a game show.

236
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,406
Whoo-hoo!
Well, I'm in.

237
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,624
Because I know I'm gonna win.

238
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:13,326
Okay, I'll do anything
to find out the truth.

239
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,078
If this works,
I can repackage it

240
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:16,546
with has-beens
and then sell it to FOX.

241
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:17,614
Beach house!

242
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:21,639
I found the ***

243
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:24,807
outfit for the birth
announcement picture.

244
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,625
(Imitates fanfare)

245
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:28,644
Huh? I was gonna get

246
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,929
a little mouth guard,
but then I realized

247
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:31,764
he's not gonna have
any teeth to protect, so...

248
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:33,966
(Sighs):
Well, it beats the dress.

249
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:36,235
It's not a dress, it's a gown.

250
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,469
And there's a difference.

251
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:39,699
Yeah, one is for girls,
the other's for gays.

252
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:40,725
Wow.

253
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,887
I'm just trying
to live my life.

254
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:42,881
I didn't realize I was

255
00:08:42,915 --> 00:08:43,915
living it with a homophobe.

256
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,517
That's not what I meant, Bry.

257
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,435
I'm just saying,
it's gonna be weird enough

258
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,720
for some people to receive
a birth announcement

259
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:49,888
with two dads on it.

260
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:51,389
Oh, my God, David.

261
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:52,974
If you're <i>so</i> concerned

262
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,609
about what other
people might think,

263
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:56,227
I'll just write
on the back of it,

264
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:58,429
"it's just a gown.
He's not gay.

265
00:08:58,447 --> 00:08:59,698
"At least, not yet.

266
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:01,432
We'll check back
at puberty."

267
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,568
Please, don't even
joke about that.

268
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,269
All the people who judge us

269
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:07,455
will get on their soapboxes
and say, "see?"

270
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,907
"He was surrounded
by so much gay,

271
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:10,108
it probably rubbed off on him."

272
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:11,376
Just like my parents
surrounded me

273
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,378
with all their straightness,
and it rubbed off on me?

274
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:15,213
It doesn't work
that way, David.

275
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:17,082
Yeah, but you know
how the world is.

276
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:18,216
People like to condemn

277
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,918
the things they
don't understand.

278
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:21,970
There was this...

279
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:23,121
(Sighs)

280
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:26,474
...kid on my junior
high mock U.N. team.

281
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:28,643
I called him a fag,

282
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:30,428
'cause I was afraid

283
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:31,730
that people would call me that.

284
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:33,832
'Cause even back then,

285
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,433
I knew that I was one.

286
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,986
I hope...

287
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,905
Our son won't
experience the same

288
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,142
pain and humiliation
and exclusion that we did.

289
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,309
David,

290
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:47,162
I'm not concerned about that,

291
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:48,363
because I do believe

292
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:50,415
that a kid's parents
rub off on them.

293
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:52,667
But the things that are gonna
rub off on our kids

294
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:54,252
are things like strength

295
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:56,487
and tolerance and love.

296
00:09:57,707 --> 00:09:59,824
(Doorbell rings)

297
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:01,826
Can we talk more
about this later?

298
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:03,428
Sure.

299
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:08,016
♪

300
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,602
Good evening, and welcome to...

301
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:13,004
Both:
"Gay or not gay?!"

302
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:14,672
(Rocky laughs)

303
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,674
Yeah, are you guys sure
this is a good idea?

304
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:18,343
Yes. Yes. Yeah.

305
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,651
(Sighs)

306
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,187
Jane.

307
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:31,156
Oh, my lord,

308
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,290
you look

309
00:10:32,324 --> 00:10:34,325
amazing.

310
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:37,862
I do not use the word "fabulous"

311
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,130
very often...

312
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:40,548
Okay, maybe I do.

313
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,884
But I've never meant it
more than I do right now.

314
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:44,669
Really? I feel

315
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:46,805
<i>so</i> unladylike in these clothes.

316
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,473
It's too late to go
home and change, right?

317
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:50,225
Boys are coming soon. Okay.

318
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,210
(Mouths)

319
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:53,978
How does the gay test work?

320
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,047
Okay, we've devised
a series of tests

321
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:57,715
to see which way your men sway.

322
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,901
The first topic we're gonna
throw at them is...

323
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:01,719
Female Oscar winners.

324
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:02,987
Dead giveaway.

325
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:04,889
Here you go.

326
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:06,224
That's very gentlemanly of you.

327
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:08,326
If you knew what I was
thinking about your new look,

328
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,611
you wouldn't call me
a gentleman.

329
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:12,063
You look hot as hell, Jane.

330
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:14,115
Now that seemed like genuine
boy-girl stuff to me.

331
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,500
What's your man-tenna
picking up?

332
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:17,535
I need more time.

333
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:22,874
Okay, guys, we have Bryan's
famous gruyère crisps

334
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:25,326
with a truffled-lobster paste.

335
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:28,079
All: Ooh! Bryan:
I'm a great cook.

336
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:30,748
Diet starts tomorrow.

337
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:33,885
Beep-beep-beep-beep.

338
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,437
Aren't you allergic?

339
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:38,022
Speaking of allergies, I about
busted out in hives when I saw

340
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:40,258
what diablo Cody was
wearing to the 2008 oscars.

341
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:41,259
Anybody remember?

342
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:42,426
Oh, my God,

343
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:43,945
that floor-length
cheetah-print frock?

344
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:46,430
She looked like a thrift store
sofa with tattoos.

345
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:48,533
Hmm. Welcome to
the jungle, honey.

346
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,618
Very confusing.
He took the bait,

347
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:53,104
but then he threw in that
reference to guns n' roses.

348
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:54,205
To what?

349
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,790
Never mind.

350
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:58,126
Over salad, we'll initiate
round two of testing,

351
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,044
based on gay men's
innate ability

352
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,996
to identify any top ten song.

353
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:03,882
Goldie, we'll need
your help with this.

354
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,134
This green goddess dressing
is delicious,

355
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:07,952
and Chris is delighted.
Bryan: Oh.

356
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:11,422
Oh, uh, I always enjoy music

357
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:12,891
with my salad.

358
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:15,059
Bryan, would you turn on
the radio?

359
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:17,395
Wait, mom,
I brought my recorder.

360
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:19,230
Would you like
to hear me play it?

361
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:21,799
Great idea! Wait. I know.
Let's make a game out of it.

362
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,401
Name that tune!

363
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:25,270
Yay!
Oh, play it.

364
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:26,771
(Plays two notes)
"Diamonds."

365
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:28,907
By Rihanna.

366
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:31,776
Come on. It was two notes.
It could be any song.

367
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,644
It could, but it isn't.

368
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:35,479
He's right.

369
00:12:35,498 --> 00:12:36,698
(Laughing)

370
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,484
That Rihanna.
Is so hot.

371
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:43,821
And then, for dessert,

372
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,292
we'll retire to the parlor
for a rousing game of celebrity!

373
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:48,676
Celebrity?
What's that?

374
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:51,129
Celebrity is a guessing game,
where you draw names out

375
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:52,680
of an orange Bauer cookie jar,
and then you try

376
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:54,332
to get your teammates to guess
the names that you're holding.

377
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,683
Bryan and I will stack the deck

378
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:58,102
with some very gay-centric
personalities.

379
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:00,939
All right, Brice, Chris,

380
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:02,473
our team is up, let's do it.

381
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:04,609
You guys are going down. Watch a
professional.

382
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:05,894
Here we go.

383
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:07,195
Shania, whenever you are ready.

384
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:08,279
All right, here we go.

385
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:09,614
All right, this guy
is an artist

386
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:11,149
or a photographer...

387
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:12,650
Both: Robert mapplethorpe!
Yes.

388
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:14,452
Okay, what do we got?

389
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:16,654
I don't know who this person is.

390
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:19,324
First name starts with,
is like "kanga..."

391
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:20,491
Rue!
McClanahan!

392
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,160
Yes! Bam!

393
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:26,164
Okay, all right, this is
the daughter of someone.

394
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:27,882
Liza Minnelli.
Lourdes Ciccone.

395
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,500
It was lourdes.

396
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:31,035
That's amazing.

397
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:32,720
Okay, oh, this one's easy,
this one's mine.

398
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:35,557
This was the quarterback for the
aggies, heisman trophy winner.

399
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:37,175
Johnny Manziel.

400
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,394
Time.

401
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:40,845
Okay, so after all that,

402
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,381
what if the data
is inconclusive?

403
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,566
There is one, final test.

404
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,185
It is absolutely 100% accurate.

405
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:48,486
But it is so horrible

406
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,988
to make a man sit through
if he's not gay.

407
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:53,241
I will only break this out
as an absolute last resort.

408
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:56,227
Oprah's legends ball.

409
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:58,746
No straight male has ever
sat through an entire viewing

410
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:01,532
without his body shutting down
to protect itself.

411
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:04,085
And, oh, yes, there
will be Cicely Tyson.

412
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,237
<i>Ay, dios mio.</i>
<i>Look at them sitting there</i>

413
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:09,040
in their Sunday best
on Oprah's front lawn!

414
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:11,376
Ooh! Miss Leontyne Price.
Work it, girl.

415
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,461
Phylicia Rashad,
I wish you were my mom!

416
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:15,546
Get off the screen,
Maria Shriver!

417
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,881
Ooh, this is my favorite part.

418
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:19,767
They pass the microphone
to miss Patti LaBelle!

419
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:20,969
Sing it, girl!
Sing it!

420
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,637
It is over!
Ah!

421
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:24,272
I'm gonna get a teensy Brandy.

422
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:27,058
Oh, Lena horne, you're alive!

423
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:28,276
It looks like your fella's

424
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,528
waving the rainbow flag
in surrender.

425
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:32,030
We don't know that
for sure, Jane.

426
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:34,399
Miss della Reese. Mm!

427
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,117
Why don't you just ask him,
Rocky?

428
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:38,820
Yeah, isn't it more honest
than playing this silly game?

429
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:40,822
I can't.
It's too hard.

430
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:42,790
Oh, sing it, Diana, sing it.
(Whispers): You look crazy.

431
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:44,292
No, the gay test is working.

432
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:45,660
Let it play out.

433
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:47,245
So that's what this is,
a bitch-hunt?

434
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:51,082
Well, I already know what I am,
so I'm gonna go.

435
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:52,800
(Singing continues on video)

436
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:53,968
Looking good, Gladys,

437
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:56,804
looking good. Nice.
She's back on top.

438
00:14:57,923 --> 00:15:00,975
Brice?

439
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,477
Please don't go.

440
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:04,462
You know, Jane, I thought you
were sharp and funny, shrewd,

441
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,514
with this new look of yours,
super sexy,

442
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,966
but this little dinner party
you're throwing

443
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:10,768
to find out if I'm gay?

444
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,136
That's pathetic.

445
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:19,477
(Both mouthing)

446
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:21,996
Aw, hell! Chris,
are you gay or straight?

447
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:23,665
Am I what?

448
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,283
Are you gay or straight?

449
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:26,868
Because this game we're playing

450
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,653
isn't working and if we're
gonna be a thing,

451
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:31,322
then I need to know. Now!

452
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:37,128
Well, I don't think I care to
answer that question, rock

453
00:15:37,162 --> 00:15:38,680
I will tell you this though:
You and I

454
00:15:38,714 --> 00:15:40,181
are most definitely
not a thing.

455
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:42,050
Not anymore.
(Snaps fingers)

456
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:48,749
Goldie, I'm so sorry
I involved Shania

457
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,485
in that gaydar dinner
last night.

458
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,619
We hurt people's feelings and
we perpetuated ugly stereotypes.

459
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,953
As an apology, please accept

460
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,788
these French lavender macaroons
from ladurée.

461
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:57,856
Oh!

462
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,541
Oh!

463
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,627
Neh, neh, neh,
they're too beautiful to eat.

464
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,161
Shania:
I'm so ashamed.

465
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,630
I messed up Rocky's relationship
with Chris,

466
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,832
and I might have
been wrong about him.

467
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,501
Maybe I never really had an
amazing gaydar power at all.

468
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,887
I'm going to write a letter
of apology on my blog

469
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,138
to the city of Portland

470
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,308
for describing its entire
female population as lesbian.

471
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,727
That's very sweet, baby.

472
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:20,312
It's a whole new sexually
ambiguous world

473
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,563
out there, and that's good.

474
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:24,149
I mean, no one can be 100% sure
that I'm gay.

475
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,654
Sure.
Yes.

476
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,322
(Speaks gibberish) But I...

477
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,606
Can I...?
Don't even...

478
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,908
(Muffled):
I'm sorry.

479
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:36,378
(Bell ringing) Man: All
right, that's a wrap, folks.

480
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,763
Take an hour for lunch.

481
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:42,734
Chris, what I did was wrong.

482
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,370
I shouldn't have lied to you about
the auspices of our dinner.

483
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,539
I am truly sorry.

484
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:51,209
I've got no right
to criticize you for lying.

485
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,378
Rocky, I am gay.

486
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,547
I don't say that aloud
too often,

487
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,683
'cause look at this crew
I work with.

488
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:58,934
It's like <i>duck dynasty</i>
<i>up in here.</i>

489
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:03,254
And I didn't tell you 'cause
we were too busy having fun.

490
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,758
But when I realized that you had
those kind of feelings for me,

491
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,277
I didn't know how to tell
the truth without hurting you.

492
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:13,315
Well, now that I know the truth,
I still want you in my life,

493
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,600
but just not as a boyfriend.

494
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:19,270
Can I still call you
"girlfriend"?

495
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,206
Oh, I insist. And let
me tell you something:

496
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,625
I am a producer of
<i>sing!</i> And that means

497
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:25,460
I contribute to the
order up in here.

498
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:28,080
And if any person
makes you feel uncomfortable

499
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,948
because of who you are,

500
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,918
you run and tattle to me
and I will bring the justice.

501
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,386
Okay.

502
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,121
And also before the Mary J.
Blige concert tomorrow...

503
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,756
Manis and pedis?

504
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,257
Girl, calm down.

505
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,642
We're doing dinner.

506
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:41,676
I'd love that.

507
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:42,794
Good. See you tomorrow.

508
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,133
Girl, that ass
is still banging.

509
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,743
(Clears throat) I heard you
sold that house on Glendower.

510
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,062
Congratulations.

511
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,131
Thank you.

512
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,916
Anything else?

513
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,451
No.

514
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,006
Actually, yes.
Oh, yeah?

515
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,491
Would you like some tips
on the best bar in Mykonos?

516
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,677
Or maybe we could play
some Lady Gaga trivia.

517
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:18,046
Or perhaps you're looking for
some tips on how to remove

518
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,015
Merlot stains
out of skinny jeans?

519
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:22,667
I wanted to say something to you
about last night.

520
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,854
I wanted to say I was sorry

521
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,773
and that what I did
was not kind.

522
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:28,974
Then why did you do it?

523
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,843
I needed to know if you were gay
or straight.

524
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,146
Oh, my God, you are so quick
to judge everyone.

525
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,314
You want to label everyone up
against some old stereotype.

526
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,201
You are the most stereotypical
person I've ever met in my life.

527
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,352
What do you care what anyone is?
Why do you care what I am?

528
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,521
Because I like you.
Because I'm d...

529
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,707
I'm drawn to you.

530
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,361
I really loved my husband,
Edgar.

531
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,047
I really did.

532
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,698
We had the best time together.

533
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,834
We would go to the theater,

534
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,470
we would discover new bistros.

535
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,839
I was so attracted to all that.

536
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:06,377
But Edgar was not attracted...
To me.

537
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,216
And I do not want to make
that same mistake twice.

538
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,819
Jane, the world has changed.

539
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,687
It's not black and white
anymore.

540
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,073
Well, maybe it's just too much
change for me.

541
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,576
(Knocks on desk)

542
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:22,727
Sit down.

543
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,564
I can help you change
your hair,

544
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,867
I can help you
change your outfit,

545
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,335
but only you can
change yourself.

546
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,903
The question you have to ask is

547
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,923
do you want to hold onto the way
things used to be and be right,

548
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:37,576
or do you want to
change and be happy?

549
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,435
You still think I'm gay?

550
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,937
(Moans)

551
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,225
I don't care.

552
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,690
So, I have been thinking about
the outfit

553
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:59,742
our baby will wear
for the birth announcement.

554
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:02,578
Oh, sweetie, I really don't
want this to be a whole thing.

555
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:05,063
So he can wear whatever
you want him to wear.

556
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:11,370
What made you change your mind?

557
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:12,621
That silly dinner party.

558
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:16,008
Last night, I became that kid
from junior high all over again.

559
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:18,711
Judging someone because I was
afraid of being judged.

560
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:20,345
It wasn't just you.

561
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,747
It was Shania, too.

562
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:23,382
(Chuckles)

563
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,051
If we don't change,
if we don't evolve, then we die.

564
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:28,721
You don't see any theropod
dinosaurs hanging around

565
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:30,773
anymore, do you?
You want to know why?

566
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:31,940
Because dromaeosauridae...

567
00:20:31,975 --> 00:20:33,992
Oh, my God, David,
it's like you want me

568
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:36,428
to stop paying attention.

569
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:39,782
I just don't want our son

570
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:41,917
to grow up the way that I did:

571
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:43,569
Afraid to be myself,

572
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:46,271
playing into stereotypes
so he won't be judged.

573
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:49,875
But he can only do that
if I'm not afraid.

574
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:52,010
So, go ahead.

575
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:55,881
Put our son in
the dress... gown.

576
00:20:55,915 --> 00:20:58,784
But I do have one
slight adjustment.

577
00:21:03,623 --> 00:21:05,557
(Laughs)

578
00:21:05,592 --> 00:21:06,958
It's perfect.

579
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:11,072
It's odd and amazing,
and it will confuse everyone.

580
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:13,202
And I love it.

581
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:20,465
