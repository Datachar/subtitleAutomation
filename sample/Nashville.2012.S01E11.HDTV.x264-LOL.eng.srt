00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:03,424
Previously on "Nashville"...

2
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:04,953
This is gonna be huge.

3
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:07,538
I don't think I can do this.
You can. You know you can.

4
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:09,860
I need to be lettin' you go.

5
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:11,747
So you came to me to find your voice again?

6
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:13,742
Sometimes you gotta blow up the box.

7
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:14,985
What the hell are you doing here?

8
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:16,473
I came to pick up my big brother.

9
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,110
Where's my guitar?

10
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:19,582
I'm gonna get it back for
you real soon, I promise.

11
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,522
Hey! Congratulations, Mr. mayor.

12
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,370
Well, you just got all the girls
following you around here.

13
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:25,771
This is my niece, Cy.

14
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:26,884
Hi. Hi.

15
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:28,705
Okay, please don't do that. No, no, no.

16
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:31,279
I quit.

17
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:37,173

Thank you, Dallas!

39
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:15,063
We love you, Rayna!

40
00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:17,306
That is the third night that
this has happened, okay?

41
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:18,847
They're acting like I'm not even there.

42
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,767
I mean, look, he's her guitar player.
What are you gonna do?

43
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:22,803
So what? Is that some sort of excuse?

44
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:23,925
Okay, I'll say something.

45
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:25,266
But we gotta go. Your plane's waiting.

46
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:26,456
Just do me a favor. Please tell me that

47
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:28,598
I don't have to deal with
her until the party.

48
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,602
Actually...

49
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,778
We're giving her a ride to Nashville.

50
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:35,124
You've got to be kiddin' me.

51
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:38,272
Rayna. Fantastic!

52
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,257
You killed it out there! I
don't even know what that was.

53
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:43,272
Wow! Just the best concert
I've seen in years.

54
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:45,892
Actually, since my last
Rayna James concert.

55
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:47,609
Madison square garden, '09. Oh!

56
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,892
And this is Calista Reeves.

57
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:50,585
She's the president of
countless records. Oh.

58
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,494
Oh, nice to meet you. Uh, she
flew in from L.A. to see you.

59
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:56,121
Came to see her or me, love? Ah. Her, Liam.

60
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:59,708
I would love to talk with you, Rayna,

61
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:00,937
about what's next.

62
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:03,650
Oh. Well, I'd love to talk to
you, but what's next for us

63
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,661
is we're about to hop on Juliette's plane

64
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:06,756
and fly back to Nashville

65
00:03:06,757 --> 00:03:09,234
'cause Edgehill's throwing
us a party for "wrong song."

66
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:11,364
It hit number one. Congrats. Thank you.

67
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,695
Well, you have a safe flight,
and I'll be in touch.

68
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:15,495
Great to meet you.

69
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,142
Liam. See you.

70
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:17,448
Walk with me? Yep.

71
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:19,865
Oh, my gosh.

72
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:21,849
That felt good.

73
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,915
Oh, yeah.

74
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:25,444
She wants you.

75
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,387
Can't say I blame her.

76
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,484
Guys?

77
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:33,460
We got the plane waiting. Okay.

79
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,581

00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:57,477
What?

84
00:03:57,478 --> 00:03:59,664
The damn thing keeps
going out of tune. I...

85
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:01,570
I think the bridge is shot.

86
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:04,065
Where is your Gibson at?

87
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:09,401
I sort of, uh... loaned
it to somebody who...

88
00:04:09,926 --> 00:04:11,363
Loaned it to somebody.

89
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,309
That's because you're one
of the good ones, Gunnar.

90
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,202
Well, you know what they
say about the nice guys.

91
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:18,924
They finish last and...

92
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:20,365
Down a Gibson.

93
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:22,614
Not if we keep writin' songs
like that, you don't.

94
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:24,290
Yeah, well, I just hope somebody...

95
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:26,301
Will do more than just put a hold on it

96
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:27,816
and cut the damn thing.

97
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:30,071
Or we could perform it ourselves.

98
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,872
Winter fest is coming up.

99
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,877
Yeah, you... you don't want
to be going to that.

100
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,777
It's not your thing.

101
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,545
Why is it not my scene?

102
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:43,785
Avery's playing it.

103
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,065
Seriously?

104
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:48,271
Awesome.

105
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,101
I got you a $1,000 guarantee

106
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:55,631
for the belmont show tomorrow.

107
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:56,918
Hell, yeah.

108
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:59,055
It's a grand more than the last gig paid.

109
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:01,344
What's the, uh, party tomorrow night?

110
00:05:01,557 --> 00:05:02,770
The number one party for the song

111
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:05,283
Rayna James and Juliette
Barnes sang at the Ryman.

112
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:06,364
For you, it's a chance to meet

113
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:08,423
everyone you need to know in music city.

114
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,255
You giving Dominic a run for his money?

115
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:13,615
He may give you a car.

116
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:14,952
I'm giving you a career.

117
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,672
What do you think of the backdrop?

118
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:20,756
Want your picture in front of it?

119
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:22,191
You know what?

120
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:25,257
Lose the "the" and "band."

121
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:28,599
From now on, it's just Avery Barkley.

122
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:31,505
All right, guys.

123
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:33,841
Let's do this.

124
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:40,114
Has anyone seen my bean dip?

125
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,236
What's it look like?

126
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:43,891
Like a can that has "bean dip" on the side.

127
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:45,470
Calista Reeves.

128
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:47,019
Pretty big deal.

129
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,311
Yeah. She's one of the most powerful
label heads in the industry.

130
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,501
Maybe the most powerful.

131
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:54,896
Well, I have to do my next
record with Edgehill.

132
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,864
Well, she wants your next five records.

133
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:59,132
"Wrong song" got you back on her radar.

134
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,064
She loves what you did with it.

135
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:03,069
We co-wrote it.

136
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,392
"Co-" means "two."

137
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,632
"Co-" actually means "with."

138
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:08,872
Why's she on my plane?

139
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:11,432
Oh, right. 'Cause she can't afford her own.

140
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:14,871
I'm 3 feet away from you. I can hear you.

141
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:16,637
Can you?

142
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:18,229
That's interesting, 'cause
when we're onstage,

143
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,917
y'all act like I don't even exist.

144
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:21,225
Oh, believe me.

145
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:24,119
We're both painfully
aware of your existence.

146
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:27,512
That is my bean dip!

147
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,007
Guys, we are going back for a party.

148
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:32,209
Can we... look, just have some
fun, for crying out loud.

149
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:36,050
I thought we were going back for
Juliette's mom's court hearing.

150
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:37,891
Stop talking.

151
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:42,434
Hey. Have you seen this?

152
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:45,748
"The axe falls hard on
guitarman Deacon Claybourne."

153
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:51,785
No. No, no, no, no. I know
what I think about it.

154
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,299
I just wanna know what you think about it.

155
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:55,345
No... yeah! The article!

156
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:57,137
You think so? You think
it's true when Cy says,

157
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:59,475
"we tried to give him a chance.
It just didn't pan out"?

158
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:02,410
No! No, Carmen, that's what I'm saying.
It didn't not pan out.

159
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,387
I caught the guy mauling my niece.

160
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:04,988
I said "no comment"

161
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,329
because I want her to have her own privacy.

162
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,421
She deserves some privacy.

163
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:08,516
I don't want to drag her into it.

164
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:10,128
Hold on. Listen to me.

165
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:11,978
"Letting someone go is always hard,

166
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,031
but watching him fall off the
wagon, that's even harder."

167
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,833
You believe that? You
think that's true? No!

168
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:19,498
I haven't had a drink in 12 damn years!

169
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:23,508
4,420 days, to be specific,
if you gotta know.

170
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:25,845
Damn it!

00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,861
Hi, my girls! Oh! Okay.

174
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:47,546
How do I have three shin guards
and only one cleat? Oh, no.

175
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,057
I lost a tooth while you were gone.

176
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:50,547
Lost a tooth and a cleat?

177
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:52,724
What is the world coming
to when I leave town?

178
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:54,274
Good morning. Hey.

179
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,348
This came for you. Hey, kiddo.

180
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,668
Hey, go get dressed for school. Hustle up.

181
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:02,509
All right, breakfast in five. I
have slaved over this stove.

182
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:04,765
Oh, my lord. What is this?

183
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:07,338
You know, you didn't have to sleep
in the guest room last night.

184
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:09,813
It was so late. I didn't wanna wake you up.

185
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,650
Right. "Hope we get some time to talk."

186
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:13,741
For starters, you need your own plane."

187
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,728
Yes, I do need my own plane.

188
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,951
Should I be jealous?

189
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:18,930
I don't think so.

190
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,675
Oh, my gosh.

191
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:23,482
Calista Reeves. Countless records.

192
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:24,749
Oh, my gosh.

193
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,881
What's going on?

194
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:28,264
Well, clearly, she means business.

195
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:29,794
No, I'm talking about us.

196
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:31,427
I mean...

197
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:33,474
We're putting on a good face for the girls.

198
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:36,547
We're sleeping in separate bedrooms.

199
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:39,633
You and I haven't made love in months.

200
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:44,306
I mean, are... are we trying to
fix things between us or not?

201
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:48,106
You know, I think we took this
time apart to get some clarity.

202
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:52,217
And...

203
00:08:53,294 --> 00:08:54,935
I don't have the answers yet.

204
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:10,580
Would you stop pacing, please?
You're making me dizzy.

205
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:14,104
Can you just explain this plea
deal to me one more time?

206
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:15,492
It's simple, jolene.

207
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:16,560
You plead guilty today,

208
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:18,082
and as long as you complete rehab,

209
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,146
the charges will be dropped...

210
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,525
And you won't have to set
foot in this courtroom again.

211
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:22,947
That'd be a relief.

212
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:24,573
Deacon.

213
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:26,867
Hey, you good?

214
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:30,501
Hey. Thank you so much.

215
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:32,946
This is Deacon. He's gonna be
speaking on my behalf. Deacon.

216
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,127
Listen, about that. I just had
this article written about me.

217
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:36,592
I... I'm just not sure

218
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:38,305
how good it's gonna be, me talking for you.

219
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:40,747
Are you talking about that
"tremolo" thing? Yeah.

220
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:42,500
What was that? That's crap.

221
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:44,577
I know what "not sober" looks like, okay?

222
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,764
I grew up with it. That's not you.

223
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:49,227
Well, I appreciate that. I just...

224
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:52,364
I still think it might be
better if you talk today.

225
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:54,725
No. No.

226
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,517
I got her a great lawyer.
You're practically her sponsor.

227
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:58,759
Why would I do the talkin'?

228
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,845
Well, you're the person most affected

229
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:01,376
by your mother's addiction.

230
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:03,815
It would mean a lot more coming from you.

231
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,407
That sucked.

232
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:12,047
Hey. Or maybe you just did.

233
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:14,169
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You...

234
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:16,073
Need to stop being so hard on yourself.

235
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,860
And you need to go do your homework.

236
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,524
All right?

237
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,215
You have a beautiful home.

238
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:23,136
Thank you.

239
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:25,093
Rayna, thank you so much for seeing me.

240
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:27,009
Oh, yeah. My pleasure.

241
00:10:27,274 --> 00:10:28,484
You just can't be afraid of the ball.

242
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:30,913
Such a sweet family. Aw, thanks.

243
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:33,864
Poor Maddie does get her
athletic ability from me.

244
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:35,404
Ohh, so sad.

245
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:37,485
Oh, well, you have other talents.

246
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:38,584
Thank you.

247
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,424
And I appreciate you coming
over to the house today

248
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:42,402
so I could have a little
more time with my girls.

249
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:45,248
You only have 24 hours at home.
I mean, I do the same thing.

250
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:46,428
I'm a mom, too.

251
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,112
And the breadwinner. I get it.

252
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:52,564
I appreciate that.

253
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,193
I can't tell you how many
years I felt like I was

254
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:57,170
hittin' my head against
a wall with Edgehill,

255
00:10:57,171 --> 00:10:58,849
trying to get 'em to understand that.

256
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,810
Yeah, that's what Liam said

257
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:01,960
when he sent me the last
roughs of what you guys cut.

258
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,901
He... he sent you those tracks?

259
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:05,288
Those tracks weren't ready to go out.

260
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,534
Ready enough. No.

261
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:09,605
Uh, yeah, he thinks it's time for a change,

262
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:10,888
and I do, too.

263
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:13,118
You're reinventing yourself.

264
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:16,209
"Wrong song" is great to get you
to the top of the charts again,

265
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,891
but the last thing you
need is to be pressured

266
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:22,681
into doing duets with
some prefab prima Donna

267
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,612
who came up overnight and...

268
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,949
Can be gone just as fast.

269
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,176
No offense.

270
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:30,663
I know how hard leaving is.

271
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:34,568
Believe me, it was hard when
I broke off from capitol.

272
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:36,818
But it doesn't make staying right.

273
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:37,851
Chicken.

274
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,491
I'm not your chicken.

275
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:42,382
Well, you know...

276
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:46,260
It does feel like I sort of
have a lifetime investment.

277
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:48,640
What you wanna do creatively,

278
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:51,359
it's not in Marshall's wheelhouse.

279
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,925
He's a bean counter and
he's never gonna get it.

280
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:57,473
He came up in this business
with his head in the books,

281
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:59,105
not in the headphones.

282
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:01,963
Look, Rayna, I don't want to "sell" you.

283
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:04,835
Ask Liam. He can vouch for me.

284
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:08,667
I want to be your partner.

Let's get out of here.

299
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:21,004
Jolene Barnes has learned from
her mistakes, your honor.

300
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:22,379
She's not a criminal.

301
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,957
She's a-a person with a disease.
She sought out treatment.

302
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:31,131
And she only has 21 more days
left on a 60-day program.

303
00:13:31,218 --> 00:13:33,532
Her daughter Juliette is here

304
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:35,564
to speak on her mother's behalf.

305
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:40,604
Speak from your heart.

306
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:47,131
Um, my mother has been an addict for...

307
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:49,175
As long as I can remember,

308
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:51,821
and I'm...

309
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:55,442
Very glad that she is gettin'
the help that she needs.

310
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,959
There's nobody who hopes
this sticks more than I do.

311
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:04,079
That's all I have to say.

312
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,277
Thank you for your testimonial, Ms. Barnes.

313
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:15,200
I'll take this under advisement
and render a decision.

314
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:17,856
It shouldn't be long.

315
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:31,330
That was a hell of a speech in there.

316
00:14:31,623 --> 00:14:33,378
I mean, really emotional.

317
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:34,776
You know, really moving.

318
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:37,844
You told me to speak from the heart, okay?

319
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:40,484
That's all I had.

320
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:43,605
You okay?

321
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:46,690
Just a busy day.

322
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,770
Oh, that's right. Y'all got that

323
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:51,314
number one song party to go to, huh?

324
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:54,241
I guess congratulations are in order.

325
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:57,666
Don't congratulate me. Congratulate Rayna.

326
00:14:57,848 --> 00:15:00,583
Apparently she's the one
who did it all by herself.

327
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,153
She's the superhero,

328
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:05,759
and I'm the person who just
came in and held her cape.

329
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:06,849
Yeah, well, that's not what happened.

330
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,508
I remember. I was there.

331
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:10,493
Yes.

332
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,372
And now you're here.

333
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:16,977
You know the offer still stands,

334
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:19,243
that you can come on tour with me anytime.

335
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,178
I appreciate it, but I think I'm just gonna

336
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:24,155
come off the road for a little bit.

337
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:26,460
Maybe even the grid.

338
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:27,932
What? No.

339
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:31,637
No way. You are way too good of a musician

340
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:36,102
to hole up and hide behind
patchy facial hair.

341
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,889
You going back to the office?

342
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:46,294
What'd they say? Well, it
didn't work, the plea.

343
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:47,217
She'll have to finish rehab.

344
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:48,126
Then there'll be another hearing

345
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,345
to try to get the criminal charges dropped.

346
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:52,541
All right. Couple more weeks then.

347
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:55,172
Still got a free pass today. Why
don't we go do somethin' fun?

348
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:57,508
I can't. I have to go to that party.

349
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,496
That I have a plus-one to I'm not using.

350
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:00,801
Why don't you come with me? Yeah?

351
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:03,473
No, I don't think it's a good
idea to have a rehab patient

352
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:06,070
at a-an industry party where
there's alcohol everywhere.

353
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:07,841
World's full of alcohol, Juliette.

354
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,769
I gotta do it sometime.

355
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,101
I mean, isn't that why God
created sparkling water?

356
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,551
I am not gonna be able to hang out either.

357
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:15,636
I'm gonna have to socialize.

358
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:16,934
I'm gonna have to talk
to a bunch of people.

359
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,597
That I don't want to talk to. It's okay.

360
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:19,768
All right, I'll just hide behind her

361
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,891
instead of my patchy facial hair.

362
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:24,676
Thank you.

363
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:28,195
Let's all go.

364
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:29,989
Calista outlined the deal for me.

365
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,849
It's gonna be really hard
for Edgehill to beat

366
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,894
or even come close to.

367
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:34,150
Well, it's tempting.

368
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:36,804
You know, and countless' track
record speaks for itself.

369
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:39,567
But I don't know. There's
something that doesn't feel...

370
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:42,802
Calista's a visionary. You're a superstar.
What's the problem?

371
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:46,204
The problem is that it just feels
like it's happening too fast.

372
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:48,708
And I wish you hadn't
given her those tracks.

373
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:50,702
Those tracks were not ready to go out.

374
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:52,665
You should've consulted with me first.

375
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,348
Well, you know, I'm just trying to help.

376
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:55,980
But if you wanna stay

377
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,904
in something stale, old,
and boring, go for it.

378
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,200
Maybe that's your thing.

379
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:02,785
Think of Edgehill like your marriage.

380
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:04,550
The only way to get through it

381
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:06,780
is by fantasizing about someone else.

382
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:13,469
What?

383
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:17,066
I heard his song three times
on the radio yesterday.

384
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,165
Apparently he's the number
one most requested.

385
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,130
Is there no music karma?

386
00:17:21,131 --> 00:17:24,437
What about guys like Gunnar
and Deacon, you guys?

387
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,562
Gunnar's right. Nice guys finish last.

388
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:27,841
Well, you know what we should do?

389
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:29,774
Wrap him in a tarp, drop him in a river?

390
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:31,757
Or band together.

391
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:33,437
Literally.

392
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,742
You know I'm dying to play with you again.

393
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:37,666
I can't bail on Gunnar.

394
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:40,861
And I am not Mr. fabulous
over there, either, so...

395
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:42,838
I'm talking about you and Gunnar.

396
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,941
You know we need a singer,

397
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:47,345
and we could use a kick-ass
guitar player as well.

398
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:49,409
Think about it.

399
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:52,242
Your songs, our rhythm section.

400
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,349
It'd be a huge win for the good guys.

401
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:56,540
Just let me run it by Gunnar.

402
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,109
My guys, our amps, your garage.

403
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,103
Oh, just like old times.

404
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:02,752
To good karma.

405
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:04,352
Oh, yeah.

406
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:12,069
The great Rayna James!

407
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,784
Back on top, back in town.

408
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:15,537
Back for the big party, huh?

409
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:16,525
Yeah.

410
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,796
What are you doin'?

411
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,765
Uh, well, I'm-a go to the party, too,

412
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,584
and then I'm gonna go to
the cabin for a while.

413
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:25,961
Looks like a long while.

414
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:28,584
Oh, yeah. Well...

415
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,544
You know, I just thought I
could use a change, you know?

416
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:35,720
Guess you read the article, huh?

417
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,262
Bunch of crap, right?

418
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:38,536
That's what I said.

419
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:41,768
You wanna talk about it?

420
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:44,888
Cy's a horse's ass. I quit the band.

421
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,424
End of story.

422
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:48,343
That's a short story.

423
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:53,271
You talk to Coleman lately?

424
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:56,678
What do you mean? Since your family
stomped all over his dreams?

425
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,256
No. Well...

426
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,415
Ray, you wanna ask me
somethin', just ask me.

427
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:01,525
Uh, all right.

428
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:04,450
Well, you know, I guess seeing
you like this and all...

429
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:07,424
It kinda scares the hell out of me, so...

430
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,553
I wanna make sure you're all right...

431
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:11,906
you're doing your program,
going to your meetings,

432
00:19:11,907 --> 00:19:13,149
stuff like that.

433
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,342
Well, the good news is,
it's not 12 years ago,

434
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:17,487
so I'm not your responsibility anymore.

435
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:18,394
I know.

436
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,074
I care about you.

437
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:23,968
That's awesome.

438
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:26,588
Why are you so angry with me?

439
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:29,096
I'm... why am I angry with you?
You don't... yeah.

440
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:29,836
I don't know, ray.

441
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,430
Maybe it's 'cause every time I turn around,

442
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:35,139
you're, like, firing me
or breaking up with me

443
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:36,537
or telling me I need to go see

444
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:38,593
what's around the next bend in the river,

445
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,845
some crap like that. Maybe that's why.

446
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,989
It's 'cause I want you to be happy.

447
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:45,757
What, like you're happy with Teddy?

448
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,453
Don't do that.

449
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,436
I forgot to ask you.

450
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:53,480
Did you ever find out if
he was cheatin' on you?

451
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:54,728
He isn't.

452
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:56,856
Well...

453
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,896
I guess you made the
right choice then, huh?

454
00:20:00,494 --> 00:20:01,641
Him over me?

455
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:05,792
Well, you know I didn't have
much choice in that matter,

456
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:07,744
'cause you couldn't stay sober.

457
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:10,211
All I know is that you put me in rehab,

458
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:12,421
and the next thing I know,
you two are gettin' married.

459
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:13,329
All right, that's why I know.

460
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,302
I know...

461
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,735
You could've waited for me,

462
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:19,580
and you didn't.

463
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:22,433
How many times did I have
to go lookin' for you?

464
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:23,057
How many times

465
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:25,200
did I have to drag you out of hotel rooms

466
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:26,609
'cause you were so wasted

467
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,182
I didn't know if you were drunk or dead?

468
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:34,321
I didn't know that the fifth time in rehab

469
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:35,678
was actually gonna take.

470
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:36,849
You lost faith in me.

471
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:39,185
You did then, you did now.

472
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,295
I never lost faith in you.

473
00:20:41,296 --> 00:20:42,154
Mm-hmm.

474
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:44,283
And I have not lost faith in you now.

475
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:45,944
And you got sober.

476
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:49,450
But I'll tell you what, it's
conversations like this

477
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:50,855
that make it so that I can't...

478
00:20:51,242 --> 00:20:52,680
I can't do this with you.

479
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,192
Then don't do it.

480
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:18,946
So you never know. You need
a song to close the show...

481
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:19,871
Boom. Number one.

482
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,938
So how many number ones is this now?

483
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:23,185
I bet you've lost count.

484
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:24,818
Oh, my gosh. You don't lose count.

485
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:25,635
But I will tell you,

486
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:28,190
every single time, it feels damn good.

487
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:29,333
Just one more, Ms. Barnes.

488
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,657
There you go. Thank you very much.

489
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:32,593
Hey!

490
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:36,199
What the hell is that?

491
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,330
Oh. Uh, Juliette,

492
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,202
I-I want you to meet, uh, Adam Wergeles.

493
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:42,344
He blogs for "country fandom" web site.

494
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,378
Hi, Juliette. Great to see you.
Hi. Good to see you.

495
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:44,710
Congratulations. Uh...

496
00:21:45,224 --> 00:21:46,345
This song is such a hit.

497
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,037
Our... our readers are dying to know,

498
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:51,093
were you intimidated by writing
with the queen of country?

499
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:52,369
Intimidated?

500
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,406
Um, no.

501
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:56,394
Well... it must've been great, though.

502
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,250
It was a thrill to see her
contribute a bridge to the song.

503
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,834
Oh! Hey, look. Marshall. Marshall, hey.

504
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:03,289
Marshall, this is Adam.

505
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:04,136
Hi, Marshall.

506
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:19,099
Jason?

507
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:21,436
Nope. I'm calling about him, though.
This his brother?

508
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,152
Who's this? Officer vega

509
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:25,928
with the bastrop county parole division.

510
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,118
Uh, Jason never made it
to his halfway house.

511
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:30,613
You picked him up from prison, correct?

512
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:33,558
Yes, sir, I did,

513
00:22:34,392 --> 00:22:36,295
and I dropped him right
off at the halfway house.

514
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,343
Happen to stop at any
pawnshops along the way?

515
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:43,958
No, sir, I did not.

516
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,202
Hi.

517
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:49,799
Listen, um,

518
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:51,575
I'm in the middle of work right now.

519
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:53,237
Is there anything else?

520
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:54,758
Your brother's a fugitive.

521
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:56,382
If there's anything you
might be keeping from us

522
00:22:56,383 --> 00:22:57,545
to help us bring him in,

523
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,188
you're in violation of the law, too, son.

524
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:03,198
Copy that.

525
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:06,693
Hey. Hey.

526
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:08,279
How are you? I'm all right.

527
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:10,218
Uh, I thought you had
the night off tonight.

528
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:11,079
I do,

529
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,398
but I also have a proposition for you.

530
00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:16,023
Okay.

531
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,099
Number one with a bullet, huh?

532
00:23:18,343 --> 00:23:20,099
It's so nice to see you. Thanks for coming.

533
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:22,965
Of course. He never misses a
chance for a free cocktail.

534
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:24,374
Hey, anything with "party" in the title,

535
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,396
I'm all about it.

536
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:27,204
By the way, how's your album coming?

537
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:30,405
It's good. You know, line
by line, chord by chord.

538
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:31,701
And you got Liam McGuinnis, right?

539
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,031
Yeah, yeah. He's great.

540
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:35,023
He's good. It's kinda different.
It's different sounds.

541
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:37,244
Uh... there's my husband.

542
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:39,052
Get on over there. All right.

543
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:41,898
Hi. Well, look at you.

544
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:43,401
Hey.

545
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:46,090
Thank you for being here.

546
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:47,806
You bet. Duty calls.

547
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:49,998
It means a lot to me that you're here

548
00:23:50,002 --> 00:23:51,009
to give the award.

549
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,818
You know I'm here for more
than just giving that award.

550
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:53,998
I'm here for those sliders.

551
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,105
Come on. Let's go celebrate. Okay.

552
00:23:57,106 --> 00:23:57,731
This is your night.

553
00:23:58,066 --> 00:23:59,969
?Pretty smile,

554
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,008
?My intuition

555
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:02,842
where is Deacon?

556
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:04,325
He is supposed to be watching her.

557
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:06,535
Excuse me, Juliette.

558
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:10,122
Mom, you cannot touch every
touch piece of food.

559
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:12,685
?You can't hide from me

560
00:24:11,377 --> 00:24:12,238
what?

561
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:14,085
I was just saying hi.

562
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,296
To Juliette Barnes?

563
00:24:15,305 --> 00:24:16,196
Yeah. Why not?

564
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:17,322
I mean, I've been waiting for you

565
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,887
to introduce me to people all night.

566
00:24:19,164 --> 00:24:20,727
I have been doing that.

567
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:23,211
Not to a&r guys. I already
have a record deal.

568
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,182
What do I need them for?

569
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:25,866
I just don't recommend

570
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,672
approaching Juliette Barnes for no reason.

571
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,735
I'm an artist like she is.

572
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:31,352
There's my reason.

573
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:14,245
Wait. You went to see Avery play?

574
00:25:14,302 --> 00:25:17,132
Oh, barely. I stayed
for, like, half a song.

575
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:18,811
Gross. But I was thinking,

576
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:21,661
us and J.T. and the band,

577
00:25:21,662 --> 00:25:23,183
like, they love the way you play,

578
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:24,702
and then we could do gigs at the 5 spot

579
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:26,543
and things like... yeah, look,
I don't know, Scarlett.

580
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:28,152
Um, I'm in the middle of work,

581
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:30,241
and I just need some time to think on it.

582
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:31,327
Okay. Uh...

583
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:33,943
Is it because it's Avery's old band?

584
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,567
This is not about Avery.

585
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,455
I've got a lot on my plate right now.

586
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:39,694
I know, and I'm worried about you.

587
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:41,793
You've been funny since Austin,

588
00:25:41,794 --> 00:25:43,250
and I'm wondering if there's
anything I can do to help,

589
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,750
or can I... do you wanna talk about it.

590
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,537
You know, you wouldn't
even begin to understand.

591
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:47,978
It's serious.

592
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:49,416
And I'm not?

593
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:51,053
No. You... you come bouncin' in here

594
00:25:51,054 --> 00:25:52,334
like this... this band thing

595
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:53,566
is the most important thing in the world.

596
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:54,381
No, I didn't think that.

597
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:56,878
I just thought maybe you'd...
you'd find it exciting

598
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,974
I checked with Deacon. He said
the boys are really good.

599
00:25:58,975 --> 00:25:59,966
Well, that sounds great.

600
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,849
Why doesn't Deacon go
play with 'em then, huh?

601
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,177
It's not like he's playin'
with somebody else.

602
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,998
Um... you know what?
Forget I said anything.

603
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,065
Don't... don't worry about it.

604
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:11,314
Scarlett.

605
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:12,995
Wait, hold on.

606
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:16,142
Hey, Gunnar. Hey, man, this
got dropped off for you.

607
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,907
What? By who?

608
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:24,120
Some guy named Jason.

609
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,087
When?

610
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:27,128
Couple hours ago.

611
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,016
Said he was just passin' through.

612
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:34,443
So as mayor elect

613
00:26:34,444 --> 00:26:36,905
and co-chair of the music
city music council,

614
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,182
we thank you for being ambassadors

615
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:40,410
on behalf of our city,

616
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,768
and for your contributions to
our greatest export, music.

617
00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:46,586
And it is my honor to present
these awards to you both.

618
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,510
And nothing personal, Juliette,

619
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:51,994
but especially to the woman
who is always number one...

620
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,155
my wife Rayna Jaymes.

621
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:56,534
?Don't

622
00:26:57,471 --> 00:26:59,430
?You think I'm under

623
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:01,098
?This ain't a feel-good

624
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:05,259
?Everything's fine

625
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,276
whoa. Hey. Excuse me. You okay?

626
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:10,236
Uh, yeah.

627
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:11,045
You know, this isn't actually

628
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,644
the... the first time that we've met.

629
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:15,557
I-I ran into you backstage,
uh, at the opry.

630
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:16,484
Literally.

631
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:19,141
I mean, I get it. Must
happen to you all the time.

632
00:27:19,142 --> 00:27:20,629
I'm just kind of getting used to it myself.

633
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,049
You know, the whole star thing.

634
00:27:22,645 --> 00:27:24,068
I signed with Dominic's label.

635
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:26,504
He's got kind of this urban
take on the music... oh, sorry.

636
00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:27,781
Trying to mix it up some.

637
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,906
You know, I-I'd love for you
to hear it sometime... hi.

638
00:27:29,957 --> 00:27:30,784
If you'd like.

639
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,273
I'm Avery Barkley.

640
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:34,097
I sing that song "kiss."

641
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:35,673
Hello. Miss Jaymes, hi.

642
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:36,421
Hi.

643
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:38,200
I'm such a big fan of yours.

644
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:40,085
Oh, thank you so much.

645
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:41,622
I'm sorry, I've never heard of it.

646
00:27:41,924 --> 00:27:42,646
Mama.

647
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:44,648
I'm jolene. I'm Juliette's mama.

648
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:47,739
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry.
Um, sorry. I-I...

649
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,203
mama, stop.

650
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:51,607
I just wanted to thank her.

651
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:52,868
Nice to meet you.

652
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,204
You do not need to thank her for anything.

653
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:57,637
Listen to me. She did not do me any favors.

654
00:27:57,638 --> 00:27:59,287
I was just trying to be nice.

655
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:00,916
Don't try to be anything.

656
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,708
You're not even supposed to be here.

657
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:04,802
Is there anything you don't ruin?

658
00:28:09,673 --> 00:28:11,333
Rayna. Liam.

659
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,384
Well, I wondered if I'd be able

660
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:14,888
to successfully avoid you all night.

661
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:17,524
Hey, Marshall. Nice party.

662
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,288
Well, over 2 million downloads,

663
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:20,404
I should be thanking you.

664
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,565
You built this label, Rayna.

665
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:23,672
We don't wanna lose you.

666
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:25,044
Word travels fast, huh?

667
00:28:25,352 --> 00:28:26,408
Well, save your breath,

668
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:28,903
'cause you're not gonna be able
to offer enough to keep us.

669
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:29,944
Well, respectfully, Liam,

670
00:28:29,945 --> 00:28:31,638
my contract's with Rayna, not with you.

671
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:34,232
Well, respectfully,
Marshall, we are partners.

672
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:36,087
I'm guessing you don't
know about the imprint

673
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,848
that countless has offered your partner

674
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:39,588
if he brings you on as an artist.

675
00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:40,868
What?

676
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:42,942
Not much of a partnership

677
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:45,386
if one half's double-dipping and
the other half doesn't know.

678
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:50,190
Did you lie to me?

679
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:52,362
That guy is such an ass.

680
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,685
Well, yeah, but who lied, you or the ass?

681
00:28:54,686 --> 00:28:56,121
It's not really a lie.

682
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:58,105
Besides, it's still great for you.

683
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,189
This isn't great for me. I'm helping you.

684
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,324
That's what you wanted, right?

685
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,259
You came knocking on my door, remember?

686
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:06,012
The whole reason you have a
career again is because of me.

687
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:07,689
Is that what you think? Mm-hmm.

688
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:10,301
'Cause my feeling was it was 'cause of us,

689
00:29:10,302 --> 00:29:11,498
'cause we're partners.

690
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,433
You don't lie to your partner.

691
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:14,764
Yeah.

692
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:16,059
Tell that to your husband.

693
00:29:18,078 --> 00:29:19,722
Come on. We are partners.

694
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,115
I'm not doing this.

695
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:23,838
What?

696
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,532
This partnership is dissolved.

697
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:28,123
Come on. You're finally
getting something going.

698
00:29:28,991 --> 00:29:30,331
We are. We aren't.

699
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:32,619
You can't just walk away from me.

700
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,480
From you? Yes, I can.

701
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,564
Is there something going
on with you and Liam?

702
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:54,701
No.

703
00:29:56,914 --> 00:29:58,142
Except I fired him

704
00:29:58,595 --> 00:29:59,406
'cause he was...

705
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:02,159
Doing some kind of deal behind my back.

706
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:03,968
That's it?

707
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:06,016
Because it looked like
a lot more than that.

708
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:08,130
I guess another man in my life lying to me

709
00:30:08,131 --> 00:30:09,250
feels like a lot more than that.

710
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:10,879
Rayna, enough already, okay?

711
00:30:12,131 --> 00:30:15,070
Look, how many times do I have
to apologize for what I did?

712
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:16,419
I screwed up, okay?

713
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,543
You know it, I know it.
But what else can I do?

714
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:21,313
You know, I'm here at home holding out hope

715
00:30:21,314 --> 00:30:22,547
that we can fix things,

716
00:30:22,548 --> 00:30:24,721
while you're out there on the
road doing God knows what.

717
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,527
I'm out there on the road
doing God knows what?

718
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:27,537
You know what I'm out there doing?

719
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:28,560
Paying for this house, among other things.

720
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:30,722
Well, yeah. Yeah, and I'm
home raising our daughters,

721
00:30:30,723 --> 00:30:32,925
that's what I'm doing.
Well, I'm standing by you.

722
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:35,086
I'm not divorcing you

723
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:36,686
or calling the cops on you.

724
00:30:37,072 --> 00:30:38,220
That's what I'm doing.

725
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:40,062
I just...

726
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:43,389
I just wanna know where we stand.

727
00:30:44,994 --> 00:30:46,107
I wanna move forward.

728
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:49,072
And instead, I'm watching
everyone in the world...

729
00:30:49,073 --> 00:30:50,321
Liam, that new label...

730
00:30:50,322 --> 00:30:51,584
everyone's trying to win you over,

731
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:52,844
and all I wanna do is win you back.

732
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:02,174
You know, I think it's complicated.

733
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:05,485
It's complicated.

734
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:12,734
Yeah, when I met you,
Deacon had destroyed you.

735
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,956
You'd put him in rehab how many times?

736
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:20,077
Five. Right.

737
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:21,453
Five.

738
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:23,456
You were alone.

739
00:31:23,764 --> 00:31:25,186
I remember you told me you just...

740
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:28,562
All you wanted was someone solid,

741
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:31,905
a guy who had his life together, and I did.

742
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:38,741
You know, then when things
fell apart for me financially

743
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:41,010
and kept falling apart,
I-I guess I lost my way.

744
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:44,161
I just wanted to be the guy that
I thought you wanted me to be.

745
00:31:45,382 --> 00:31:47,490
And God knows it doesn't
excuse what I did, but...

746
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,762
I guess at the time,

747
00:31:52,965 --> 00:31:54,673
I thought I was doing it
for the right reason.

748
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,776
Maybe we're not all that different, Rayna.

749
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,177
Wrong choice, right reason.

750
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:06,592
Maybe that's how we ended up together.

751
00:32:13,023 --> 00:32:15,490
Are you gonna answer me?
Page and plant? Right.

752
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:16,207
Well, hey.

753
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:17,520
Hey, hey, hey, killer.

754
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:18,867
How you doin'? How you doin'?

755
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:20,351
I'm good. Good.

756
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:24,801
Hey, guys, I know, like, you're all set up.

757
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:26,341
You should play here long as you want,

758
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:27,588
but I did talk to Gunnar about it.

759
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:28,852
He said the whole joining forces this

760
00:32:28,853 --> 00:32:30,833
wasn't gonna work out. I-I'm sorry.

761
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:32,866
He just taught us "one works better."

762
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:34,433
What are you doing here?

763
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:36,802
Wanted the good guys to win,

764
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:39,938
even if I don't act like
one myself sometimes.

765
00:32:40,568 --> 00:32:41,528
Whatever it is that's bothering you,

766
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:42,838
I sure wish you'd talk about it.

767
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:45,639
I'd rather just play, if that's all right.

768
00:32:47,595 --> 00:32:49,222
It's good to see you got your Gibson back.

769
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:52,525
All right, you boys ready?

770
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:53,806
Count it off. Mm-hmm.

771
00:32:54,577 --> 00:32:55,949
Three, four.

772
00:32:59,223 --> 00:33:00,195
Deacon?

773
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:02,275
Hey!

774
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:04,966
Deacon?!

775
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:07,287
Open the damn door!

776
00:33:07,515 --> 00:33:08,554
I know you're in there!

777
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:10,791
Your piece-of-crap truck's out here!

778
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:13,564
Where the hell have you been?!

779
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:17,644
Deacon?

780
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:19,244
Just go away.

781
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,620
That's not gonna happen.

782
00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:32,124
It was out of tune.

783
00:33:38,654 --> 00:33:40,935
Well, you're too miserable to be drunk.

784
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:44,683
You know so much, don't you?

785
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:47,674
I know a dry drunk when I see one.

786
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:58,394
Look at me. Come with me.

787
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:00,522
You should be on the road.

788
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:02,859
You need to be playin', writin' music,

789
00:34:03,165 --> 00:34:05,562
going to meetings, working the program.

790
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:07,335
Look, there's a group in my crew.

791
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:08,585
They meet twice a week.

792
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,905
It's a pain in my ass.

793
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:15,177
But you need to do what you love.

794
00:34:18,461 --> 00:34:19,801
Isn't that why you got sober?

795
00:34:22,414 --> 00:34:23,865
Isn't that what kept you sober?

796
00:34:26,623 --> 00:34:27,512
You know, it's funny.

797
00:34:27,513 --> 00:34:29,187
I always used to say that, uh,

798
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:31,627
I got sober for myself, you know?

799
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:33,723
That's what you're supposed to say.

800
00:34:36,815 --> 00:34:37,965
It was never true.

801
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,397
I got sober for Rayna.

802
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:50,717
What kept me sober...

803
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,529
Was hoping for something that
ain't never gonna happen.

804
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:03,131
You really think she saved your life?

805
00:35:06,723 --> 00:35:08,406
From an outsider's perspective,

806
00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:11,371
she is the opposite of what you need.

807
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:14,491
You gonna tell me what I need now?

808
00:35:18,004 --> 00:35:20,146
Don't you got another
addict to go take care of?

809
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,652
I'm serious. I mean, look at

810
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,581
you got all the care and
concern in the world for me,

811
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:26,866
but what about her, nothin'?

812
00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:30,921
See, I don't get that,

813
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:32,517
'cause she and me, we're the same.

814
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:35,015
Yeah.

815
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,559
We're fightin' the exact same battle.

816
00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:40,871
Right now, only difference is...

817
00:35:43,323 --> 00:35:44,949
She's doing a whole lot better than me.

818
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:03,492
Hey. There you are.

819
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,492
Baby, I'm sorry.

820
00:36:08,185 --> 00:36:11,189
No. No, I'm sorry.

821
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,276
Deacon's in bad shape.

822
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:16,069
He didn't drink, but he...

823
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:18,565
Easily could've.

824
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:23,624
I just feel like if he, of all people,

825
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,124
can fall off the wagon...

826
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,781
Then there's no hope for me.

827
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:35,493
Listen to me. I...

828
00:36:36,936 --> 00:36:39,460
I should have told the
judge how far you've come.

829
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:42,884
I mean, that you've stayed in rehab,

830
00:36:43,385 --> 00:36:45,683
the fact that you're even
here in the first place.

831
00:36:46,952 --> 00:36:48,357
I should have told you that I'm...

832
00:36:49,225 --> 00:36:51,845
Really, really proud of you.

833
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,103
You don't know what that means to me.

834
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:03,567
Somebody like you being...

835
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,455
Proud of somebody like me?

836
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,227
Somebody like me? What
are you talking about?

837
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:09,519
Baby, I'm in awe of you.

838
00:37:10,484 --> 00:37:12,738
I saw you up on that stage
tonight with the legend,

839
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:14,115
with the woman that you've admired

840
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:15,615
since you were a little girl, and...

841
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,424
Now you're her equal.

842
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:20,007
You think I'm Rayna's equal?

843
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:22,836
Oh, yeah, and then some.

844
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:26,711
Baby, she... she grew up in belle Meade,

845
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:28,579
and, well, you came from...

846
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:30,372
You came from me.

847
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:34,487
And you're so amazing and
talented and beautiful.

848
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:38,324
And... if you can come
from someone like me?

849
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,172
Well, that just proves that there's hope.

850
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:45,399
I don't tell you that I'm proud,

851
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,990
because then it sounds like
I'm trying to take credit.

852
00:37:50,169 --> 00:37:52,816
But I am. I'm so proud of you.

853
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:56,324
All th you are

854
00:37:56,325 --> 00:37:58,227
and... and everything you've become, honey,

855
00:37:58,228 --> 00:38:00,017
that's... that's not because of me.

856
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,159
It's in spite of me.

857
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,096
Who you are and where you are, honey...

858
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:09,968
Baby, that's all you.

859
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:16,132
I'd have told you,

860
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:17,711
but I didn't think that what I thought

861
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:19,184
meant anything to you.

862
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,409
It means somethin'.

863
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,932
?You been working

864
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:52,103

00:39:02,161 --> 00:39:06,259
?Oh, girl, when you walk

?Talk like that

870
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:09,603
?Look like that

871
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:12,385
?I'm chained to your will

872
00:39:12,386 --> 00:39:13,361
?So, honey,

873
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:15,245

♪'Cause this one works better than two♪

883
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:57,269
Ohh. Y'all be good for your daddy, okay?

884
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:57,934
Okay. Okay, mom.

885
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,582
See you in a couple weeks. All right.

886
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,355
Okay? Let's go look at the planes.

887
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:07,871
You be good, too.

888
00:40:10,036 --> 00:40:12,735
Listen, as far as I'm
concerned, we're still married,

889
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:16,639
whether I'm here in Nashville
or whether I'm out on tour.

890
00:40:21,658 --> 00:40:24,311
I chose you. That was never a wrong choice.

891
00:40:28,147 --> 00:40:29,246
I think now we're just...

892
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:31,618
Choosing what our future's gonna be.

893
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,758
Right.

894
00:40:48,337 --> 00:40:49,437
Marshall keeps calling.

895
00:40:50,462 --> 00:40:51,565
So does Calista.

896
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:53,755
They both wanna know where you stand.

897
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:55,788
I want my own label.

898
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:58,223
Tell that to Marshall, and if he says yes,

899
00:40:58,224 --> 00:40:59,677
then I will stay at Edgehill.

900
00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:01,676
Okay, so no Calista?

901
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:03,628
No. Not yet.

902
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:07,533
Why do we have to do everything
at the crack of butt?

903
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:11,974
Will you please also tell
him I want my own plane?

904
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:15,718
All right. So, hey, we
goin' to Kansas City?

905
00:41:16,713 --> 00:41:18,022
Not quite yet.

906
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:20,455
We're waitin' for one more.

907
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:27,047
Excuse me.

908
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,318
Deacon. How y'all doing?

909
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:30,967
Y'all take care, okay? Okay.

910
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:46,354
Hey.

911
00:41:47,621 --> 00:41:48,754
Sorry for the hold-up.

912
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:54,742
Did you hire him to replace Liam

913
00:41:54,743 --> 00:41:55,825
and not talk to me about it?

914
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:57,105
No. Of course not.

915
00:41:58,161 --> 00:41:59,297
I'm not here for your band.

916
00:42:02,342 --> 00:42:03,411
He's joining mine.
