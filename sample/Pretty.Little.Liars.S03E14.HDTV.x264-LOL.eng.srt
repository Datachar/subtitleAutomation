00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:03,101
Previously on Pretty Little Liars.

2
00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:04,502
Welcome to the Lost Woods resort.

3
00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:06,704
Maybe you remember our
friend, Vivian Darkbloom.

4
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:09,474
You check in at the Lost Woods
because you don't want to be found.

5
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,142
- What are you doing here?
- I was curious.

6
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:13,980
- He's the father of my son.
- Yeah, he deserves to know that.

7
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:17,314
I didn't kill Alison,
but Jenna thinks I did.

8
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,584
- That's it?
- I went back.

9
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:21,654
- You're lying.
- She was alive when I left.

10
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,694
Meredith got the job. -
The job at Rosewood High.

11
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:32,499
Well, Aria, I forgot you're
still a student here.

12
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,802
Change of plan. I'll see you soon.

13
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,479
- Is it a bad time?
- What are you doing here?

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,516
My doctors released me. -
In the middle of the night?

15
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,584
Hanna, I need your help.

16
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,720
My parents are forcing
me to go back to school,

17
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,756
- and I'm so scared.
- Mona...

18
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,925
Everyone knows what I've done,
and I have no one in my corner.

19
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,729
If you're expecting me and
my friends to forgive you...

20
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,063
I don't expect them to, but,
Hanna, you're different.

21
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,603
Wren said you were my guardian angel.

22
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,004
He said that you stood up for me.

23
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,107
You are not defenseless, Mona.

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,441
You spent the last two
years majoring in torture.

25
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,247
You don't believe that a
person can get better?

26
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,182
Hanna, I had a breakdown,

27
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,218
but I've turned a corner.

28
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,252
I'm on new meds, everything's changed.

29
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:03,056
I'm not proud of who I was.

30
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:06,024
Just try to see me for who I am. Now.

31
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,059
I do see you, Mona. You're freaking me out.

32
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,896
( Knocking on door ) - Hanna!

33
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,064
Who's that?

34
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,398
- Yeah, grandma?
- Are you alone in there? I heard voices.

35
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,870
Uh, no, no. It's just me.

36
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,973
I'm... reading out loud. Go back to sleep.

37
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,943
( Quietly ) Thank you.

38
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,241

46
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,487
He's here to install the new alarm.
Sorry, babe.

47
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,024
I didn't think they'd
get to the second floor

48
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:48,726
until after you left for school.

49
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,995
You're putting an alarm on my window?

50
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:54,167
On every window. Your mom
wants the best system around.

51
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:57,501
There's an app where I can turn
it on remote from my phone.

52
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,503
So how will I know when it's on?

53
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,139
Well, considering what's
been happening in this town

54
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,210
for the past two years, think 24/7.

55
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,178
Did you eat?

56
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,047
Yeah, I'll grab something.

57
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,682
Hilary Reynolds called.

58
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,186
She's so angry, she can barely speak.

59
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:17,036
Wait, Garrett's mother? What did she want?

60
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,593
She wants her son back.

61
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,227
But she can't have that.

62
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,495
So she's going after the Rosewood police.

63
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:26,897
I told her I would be there tomorrow
night at the community meeting.

64
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:29,000
- Why would you go to that?
- Why wouldn't I?

65
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,035
She's right. They let an
innocent man out of jail,

66
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:33,039
and provided no protection for him.

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,794
I don't think of the word
"innocent" when I think of Garrett.

68
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,976
Evidently, you're not alone.

69
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:40,978
Looks like somebody else
thought it was their right

70
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,680
to take justice into their own hands.

71
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,982
Dad, Alison's murder has never been solved.

72
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:47,020
You still think Garrett did it?

73
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,121
Do you?

74
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,188
I'm gonna be late. Are
my sneakers downstairs?

75
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,491
I'm not so sure you'll go on that run.

76
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:55,192
Your mom and I just aren't comfortable

77
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:56,663
with you being out after dark.

78
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:59,831
- Dad, I raised $274 in pledges.
- I know.

79
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,200
You're welcome to have Paige over,

80
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,169
but you are not going out.

81
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,206
Aria: So this is the new world order?

82
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:12,143
We're gonna have to face off
with Mona in school every day?

83
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:14,679
She told Hanna that she's better now.
Better at what?

84
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,081
I'll tell you what. She sneaks
in my house past midnight,

85
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:19,050
I'm sleeping with a
crowbar under my pillow.

86
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,254
The only question is, do we ignore her?

87
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,921
Here's a hint. Yes.

88
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,255
Mona had serious insight
into what happened to Maya.

89
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,794
What if she could tell us
why Garrett was killed?

90
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,997
So now you think Mona's the
keeper of more secrets?

91
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,200
She certainly knows all of ours.

92
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,534
What if she has some kind of
connection to the N.A.T. club?

93
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,540
Spencer, that club ended while
she was still loser Mona.

94
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,641
Pre-lasik and metal mouth.

95
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,975
If those pervs didn't even
wanna peep in her window,

96
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:46,713
why would they wanna hang out with her?

97
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,214
Maybe she was peeping at them.

98
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,149
Look, two members of the N.A.T.
club are dead.

99
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,819
Okay, maybe the person who
killed Ali is still freaked out

100
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,989
that there's a tape floating
around somewhere out there.

101
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,157
Did you...

102
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,727
Did you ever ask your dad?

103
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,162
Ask him what?

104
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,164
About what Garrett said.

105
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,532
You know, about him meeting
up with Ali that night.

106
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,102
My dad and I are finally getting along.

107
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:13,771
I'm not gonna slap him with some
whacked-out story garret made up

108
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:15,740
so he could clear his own name.

109
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,575
I hear you, but... - but what?

110
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:19,076
Spence, Garrett lied about a lot.

111
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:21,681
Why are we suddenly gonna
believe anything he ever said?

112
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,687
What's that?

113
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,524
Someone baked you some muffins
and left 'em at the door.

114
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,725
Hm. Who's "M"?

115
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,196
- Mona.
- Mona?

116
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,132
You don't have to eat these.

117
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,167
I've got huevos rancheros,

118
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,103
pork sausage, and hash browns.

119
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,973
- Please stop.
- Are you sick?

120
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:47,973
I could be.

121
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,307
Is this Mona the same Mona...

122
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,810
Yeah. She wants a fresh start.

123
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,549
Are you ready to give it to her?

124
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,050
It's complicated, grandma.

125
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,685
I hear you, honey.

126
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,721
When cousin Heshy came back,

127
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,891
no one wanted to touch him
with a ten-foot pole.

128
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,958
Who's cousin Heshy?

129
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,660
Alberta's youngest.

130
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,729
He was always a little off,

131
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,932
but in high school, he jumped the tracks.

132
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,699
What'd he do?

133
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,703
One morning at breakfast,
he served his mom and dad

134
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,972
two bowls of rusty nails

135
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:21,974
with milk poured over 'em.

136
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,876
And when they refused to eat,

137
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,145
he snatched up a fistful,

138
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,048
and just squeezed until blood came out.

139
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,382
I'm sorry. How are we
related to this person?

140
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,153
Oh, no, my point is,

141
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,924
they sent him away for about four months.

142
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,091
He's been fine ever since.

143
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,198
So you really think people can change?

144
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,865
Heshy did.

145
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,199
I mean, the thing is, what's done is done.

146
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,604
- And when the rink gets icy...
- Yeah, I'm exhausted.

147
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:55,873
I can't deal. I'm taking a sick day.

148
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:56,909
Hanna, you go to school.

149
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,211
Maybe you need to let this girl

150
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,247
have a chance to win you back.

151
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,181
You know,

152
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,151
if I were her, I'd fight to the death

153
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,054
to have you as my friend.

154
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,597
I'm basically under house arrest.

155
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,533
My mom's now using my dad to
squeeze information outta me

156
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:23,968
about Halloween, the lighthouse.

157
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,003
- What have you told him?
- Nothing.

158
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:28,608
If he knew half the crap we'd been
through, he'd ship me off to Guam.

159
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,642
Hey.

160
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,576
Thought you were playing Mona's bodyguard.

161
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:34,078
Okay, I said I'd be around for her.

162
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,883
I'm thinking maybe we all
should be her friend.

163
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,618
I mean, if Mona knows why Garrett died,

164
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,687
right after he told that
story about Aria's dad...

165
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,088
stop.

166
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,022
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

167
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:47,525
- We're not gonna talk about that.
- No, go ahead.

168
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,727
Talk about it. Just do
it when I'm not here.

169
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:50,861
Aria - what's next?

170
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,530
Are we all gonna start wondering

171
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:54,665
- if my dad was on the Halloween train, too?
- What?

172
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,034
You actually believe that
my own dad would drug me,

173
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:58,671
and then lock me in a box.

174
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,520
Hello, Aria.

175
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,123
Girl: What are you doing here?

176
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,724
Boy: Yeah, you shouldn't be here.

177
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,568
Welcome to Mona 2.0.

178
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,207
- Aria, I'm sorry. I wasn't trying...
- Don't worry about it.

179
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,779
- None of really believe your dad...
- I know.

180
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,047
I overreacted.

181
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,616
The thing is, Garrett did say it,

182
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,250
and it's really freakin' hard

183
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:48,588
when you can't look at your
boyfriend, and now your own dad,

184
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,755
- without...
- Without what?

185
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,490
Wait, what's with ezra?

186
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,824
- I still haven't told him about...
- His son.

187
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:59,161
Yeah. I plan on telling him
every time we're together,

188
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,933
but I just bail.

189
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,871
Where's Mrs. Grizzuti?

190
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,239
Uh, I'm guessing she had her baby.

191
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,507
And now Meredith's her replacement?

192
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:12,211
Please stick a fork in my neck.

193
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,213
( Bell rings )

194
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,819
The check and balance
system was established

195
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,156
so that no branch could
wield absolute power

196
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,924
over another branch.

197
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,960
Why do we think this was so important

198
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,929
to our founding fathers?

199
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,931
Aria.

200
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,699
What?

201
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,033
Look, guys, I don't know what Mrs.
Grazzuti's take was,

202
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,837
but while I'm here, no phones in class.

203
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,743
I wasn't... I wasn't on my phone.

204
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,910
Yeah, you were.

205
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,847
Tell you what. Give it to me.

206
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,153
This way, you won't even be tempted.

207
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,258
It was important to our founding fathers

208
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,592
because they wanted to be sure
that no one had absolute power.

209
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,663
( Bell rings )

210
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,566
Aria.

211
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,770
Can you stay for a few minutes, please?

212
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,478
I guess since you travel in a pack,

213
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,046
you can all stay.

214
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,716
Just so we don't get off on the wrong foot,

215
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,717
let's be clear.

216
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,819
I have a job to do,

217
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,153
and if you ladies want to graduate,

218
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,925
so do you.

219
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,225
Look, I saw what you were texting.

220
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:36,762
You're in this class to discuss

221
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,898
American history, not mine. Got it?

222
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,835
Yeah.

223
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,169
Thank you. Have a nice day.

224
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,581
Mona, wait. Mona, I couldn't leave Aria.

225
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,885
No, that's okay. I get it. It
must be really tough for her.

226
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,158
Mona, what is it? Is that a brain?

227
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,493
Close your door.

228
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,096
Close your locker.

229
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,532
Come on, let's get out of here.
What are you doing?

230
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:15,090
Lucas, what did she say to you?
Who did that?

231
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,940
So wait, wait.

232
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,841
Someone stole that from the bio lab?

233
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:32,810
They have cow brains up there?

234
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,978
- I didn't even think...
- That's because you got excused

235
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:36,847
from dissection based
on vegetarian grounds.

236
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:39,183
Guys, people are gonna think
that we put that in her locker.

237
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,018
It wasn't vegetarian, it was humanitarian.

238
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,986
- Are you still hating on me?
- Possibly.

239
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:45,689
Guys, pay attention. People
are gonna think that was us.

240
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,792
How? When? We were all being
held hostage by Meredith.

241
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:51,096
It wasn't in her locker
before first period.

242
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:54,430
So now we're depending on Meredith
to be our alibi? See you in jail.

243
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,203
I gotta say, Mona's a lot stronger than me.

244
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,004
I would've lost it.

245
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,774
- I feel sorry for her.
- Yeah, me, too.

246
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,543
Okay, are we done feeling sorry?

247
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,913
Because she's done a lot worse to us, guys.

248
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,714
A lot.

249
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,751
Hi.

250
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,721
- Hey.
- Hi.

251
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,359
Mona, you don't think we had
anything to do with that, do you?

252
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,997
Of course not. Why would you
dump on me after I helped you?

253
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,170
Helped me?

254
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,474
Figure out who the creep was
that killed your girlfriend.

255
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,179
But I know that there's
still bad blood between us,

256
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,513
and I know that I have to earn your trust,

257
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,117
and prove that I'm worthy.

258
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,719
But I will. You'll see.

259
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,690
I'm better now.

260
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,940
Hey.

261
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,942
Sure you wanna do this?

262
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,979
Face it, Caleb. We were
never under the radar.

263
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,813
Did you hear about Mona?

264
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,216
Yeah, I did. Sorry I missed that.

265
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,851
Something weird is going on.

266
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,552
Do you think it's possible
that Mona did that to herself?

267
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,990
It's possible, but something's
definitely going on

268
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,891
between Mona and Lucas.

269
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,561
- Why is he limping?
- Maybe she kicked him.

270
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,629
You've gotta talk to him.

271
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,565
Find out if he hurt that leg on Halloween.

272
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,799
I'm lost.

273
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,169
When Aria was in that box,

274
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,473
she stabbed someone who was trying
to throw her off the train.

275
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,574
That was weeks ago.

276
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,908
And it was also a dirty old screwdriver.
Maybe it didn't heal.

277
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,215
Just... please.

278
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,117
Talk to him, okay?

279
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,553
Okay.

280
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,458
I couldn't pick up her call
because my phone was turned off.

281
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,630
Dad, I have classes.

282
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,164
I can't step out every ten minutes

283
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,935
just to report to mom that I'm still alive.

284
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,970
No, not straight from school.

285
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,938
I have work.

286
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,508
I'm supposed to give up my job now, too?

287
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:23,011
What? Yes, yes. I'll come
home right after work.

288
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,049
Bye.

289
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,691
Welcome to the Lost Woods resort.

290
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,763
It would've been nice to
have had more warning,

291
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,766
but we knew she couldn't
stay in that place forever.

292
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,603
Do you still wanna run after school?

293
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:45,737
Yeah, sure.

294
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,806
I missed you.

295
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,941
How come I didn't hear from you last night?

296
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,212
I fell asleep early.
Didn't get your message.

297
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,880
Can I ask you something?

298
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,117
Promise that you won't get upset.

299
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,619
Ask.

300
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,920
Do you think that Jenna transferred schools

301
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:06,690
because after Garrett, she was
afraid that she might be next?

302
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:09,826
Jason is the last member of the N.A.T.
club left.

303
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:11,028
I know that she wasn't an official...

304
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,130
why do you obsess about this stuff?

305
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:14,965
How can I not obsess about it?

306
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:17,701
The cops still don't
know who killed Garrett.

307
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:20,139
They can't even find the
gun he was shot with.

308
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,674
Unbelievable.

309
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,945
Look who she's cozying up to now.

310
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:29,747
- Spencer, leave it alone.
- No, I can't.

311
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,750
He's basically hugging a hand grenade.

312
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,657
He was cleaning up Mona's locker.

313
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,660
He looked right through me.

314
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,064
- Maybe it wasn't him.
- It was him.

315
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,398
Maybe creepy Harold has a creepy twin.

316
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,639
( Music playing faintly )

317
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,146
( Country music playing on radio )

318
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,254
Why does he have Mona's stuff?

319
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,691
- Maybe he's returning it.
- Shh!

320
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,745
You've worn this?

321
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,615
Yeah, in every marathon I've ever run.

322
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,716
Here. Wear it.

323
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,252
It'll bring you luck

324
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,955
no. I can't take that.

325
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,289
- What if I lose it?
- I'll have to lose you.

326
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,627
That was a joke.

327
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,762
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

328
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,965
Nothing. I'm just...

329
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,700
Guess I'm just deciding if I
really want to do this thing.

330
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,835
No, no, no. You have to do this.

331
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:01,605
It's for a good cause,
friends are counting on you,

332
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:04,710
and I pledged half of
last year's unemployment.

333
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,178
You'll be fine.

334
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,214
Just... change your shoes.

335
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,755
( Cell phone rings ) - What's wrong?

336
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,825
Nothing. It just might be my mom.

337
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,659
She called in sick today,

338
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,730
but I'm guessing it's 'cause
it was Meredith's first day.

339
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,934
- Is it your mom?
- Yeah.

340
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,537
Yeah, I'm gonna have to...

341
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,472
Swing by her place and do a little hand holding.
She's pretty bugged out.

342
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:38,076
She's lucky to have you, since I can't.

343
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,746
Call me?

344
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,715
I will.

345
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:19,983
Oh, under ten! Beat it.

346
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:23,119
I think we earned some hot tub.

347
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,122
Spence, you want me to fire it up?

348
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:30,293
Yeah. Just give me a second.

349
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:36,299
Hey, Jason.

350
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,234
Hey there, Spencer.

351
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:40,837
What's going on with you and Mona?

352
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:43,440
Did you go to her or did
she come up to you?

353
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:48,078
Look, I know that her first day
back wasn't exactly a bubble bath.

354
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,013
Okay, but...

355
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:51,482
You should be careful.

356
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,816
What am I missing here?

357
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,251
Just that she's dangerous.

358
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:58,289
Ian and Garrett are both dead.

359
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,223
Jenna's awol.

360
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:02,090
I'm starting to think
that Mona might have...

361
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:03,994
got it. I'll keep that in mind.

362
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:06,763
Toby can hear this. He knows her resume.

363
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:08,065
She once tried to kill him

364
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,399
by unscrewing a piece of scaffolding.
She cannot be trusted.

365
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:14,803
People around here used to
say the same thing about me.

366
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:16,907
I like to give people the
benefit of the doubt

367
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,042
before I cut them off.

368
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:22,178
Good-bye. Thanks for the tip.

369
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:33,957
You sure you didn't tell her?

370
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,191
Why would I tell Mona that ezra has a kid?

371
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:38,293
If ezra would've opened that door...

372
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:40,062
he didn't, all right, so just breathe.

373
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:41,930
What'd you do with the basket?

374
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:44,032
I trashed it. Why? Did you
want the jelly beans?

375
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,969
Aria's right, Hanna.
Mona's up to something.

376
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,870
It's not a coincidence the
first day she's back,

377
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:50,941
Harold's also there, and
somehow doesn't recognize us.

378
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,309
I'm not saying it wasn't weird.

379
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,111
I just think maybe he took the job
because he wanted to see her.

380
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:58,246
- Why would he want to see her?
- She spent a lot of time there.

381
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:00,484
- Maybe they were buddies.
- The buddy-moon's over.

382
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,019
We need to bust into creepy's closet

383
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,989
and see what else he saved for her.

384
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,856
- Hey.
- Hi.

385
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:09,524
- Did you talk to Lucas?
- He's not feeling very chatty.

386
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:12,194
- But I did find something else.
- What is that?

387
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:14,264
It's a transcript from the
meeting the principal had

388
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:17,598
- with Mona and her parents last week.
- How did you get this?

389
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:19,803
There's perks to knowing
the school's pass code.

390
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:22,972
- What are we looking for?
- Page two.

391
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:25,874
Turns out Mona's parents did not want
her to come back to Rosewood High.

392
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,943
It was Mona who begged to come back in.

393
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:30,514
Wait. I thought she told you
her parents were forcing her.

394
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,848
I'm guessing she lied. Mona's back
to take care of unfinished business.

395
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,852
I gotta go.

396
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:37,987
Hey, feed me. I'm starving.

397
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:41,321
Did Mona sign that card on the
muffin basket with "M" or "A"?

398
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:43,525
- Could we just take a second before we...
- Before we what?

399
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:45,894
- Let her destroy our lives again?
- No.

400
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:47,531
If ezra finds out that he
has a kid through "a"...

401
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,865
don't give "a" all the power, Aria.
Tell Fitz he has a son.

402
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:52,435
- I can't.
- Why not?

403
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:54,302
Because that son has a mother,
and she asked me not to.

404
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:56,306
Yeah, and every day that
goes by is another day

405
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:59,242
that kid goes without meeting his dad,

406
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:00,910
and believe me,

407
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:03,881
that kid might be dealing
with it for a long time.

408
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:33,242
What are you thinking about?

409
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:35,411
I'm not.

410
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,551
What are you stewing about?

411
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:44,885
Why doesn't Jason get it?

412
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:46,922
He knows that Mona's dangerous.

413
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:49,925
Jason's a big boy. He can
take care of himself.

414
00:23:49,926 --> 00:23:52,096
Yeah, but nobody's got his back.

415
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,430
I've got my friends, I've got you.
He's completely alone.

416
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,538
What was that?

417
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:04,340
Did you hear that?

418
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:06,909
Hello?

419
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:10,848
Hey, is someone out there?

420
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,457
Relax.

421
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:29,065
I wanna go inside.

422
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,502
I'm sorry. I can't do this right now.

423
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,911
( Knocking on door ) - Come in.

424
00:24:41,912 --> 00:24:43,546
Hi there.

425
00:24:43,547 --> 00:24:46,850
I wasn't even sure anyone
was home, it's so quiet.

426
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:49,118
Mike went to Wyatt's to study.

427
00:24:51,088 --> 00:24:54,323
So... how was school today?

428
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:01,031
Did you talk to Meredith?

429
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,431
I did.

430
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:04,766
I'd completely forgotten
that you were in that class.

431
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:07,905
- I can't drop it. I need it to graduate.
- Why should you?

432
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,239
Sounds like you handled that
situation like an adult.

433
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:13,376
Thank you for that.

434
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:15,812
What did Meredith tell you?

435
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:18,382
Well, she said that you and your friends

436
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,017
were cautiously welcoming.

437
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:24,351
That's the most that any
new teacher can expect.

438
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:27,323
God knows, I have been there.

439
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:30,526
Kids can be very cruel.

440
00:25:32,462 --> 00:25:35,164
Hey, dad.

441
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:37,934
Did you like Alison?

442
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:40,036
What?

443
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:43,339
Like, what did you think
of her as a person?

444
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,673
I like all of your friends.

445
00:25:46,777 --> 00:25:49,011
Why do you ask that?

446
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:52,345
I just know that mom had
some issues with her.

447
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:54,884
She thought Ali was entitled.

448
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:58,788
I think most of that just comes from

449
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:01,357
being at an awkward age.

450
00:26:04,895 --> 00:26:08,228
You never spent any real time
alone with her, though, did you?

451
00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:12,768
Why would I have?

452
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:20,076
You still really miss her, huh?

453
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:24,080
Yeah.

454
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:50,941
Ever since I was little, and
all through junior high,

455
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,043
I was considered a loser.

456
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:57,179
I was humiliated, picked on,

457
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,348
and tortured.

458
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:02,386
And as hard as all that
misery and torture was...

459
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,720
( Crying )

460
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:10,393
She sent this to you?

461
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:12,095
Yeah, and everyone else in cyber space.

462
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:14,363
It has 1,600 likes.

463
00:27:14,364 --> 00:27:16,865
That child is more twisted than my toes.

464
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:18,166
She's trying way too hard.

465
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:20,802
You were the one who told me
to give her a second chance.

466
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:22,537
That was before I saw her campaign.

467
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:25,275
Right now, I think Mona may
be the best argument we got

468
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,777
against human cloning.

469
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:32,514
Before you turn this off,

470
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:34,384
or throw something at the screen,

471
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:36,285
please just hear me out.

472
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:38,553
I've been in Radley for
over seven months now.

473
00:27:38,554 --> 00:27:41,091
- ( Knocking on door )
- And I wanna tell you about what I...

474
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,059
( stops video )

475
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:45,928
Lucas?

476
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:49,197
- Hi. I know you're on your way out.
- No, no. Come in.

477
00:27:49,198 --> 00:27:52,369
- I don't wanna keep you.
- Seriously, just come in.

478
00:27:58,175 --> 00:27:59,541
Could you get this to Caleb?

479
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:02,777
I tried to find him, but I guess
he's not living in the same spot.

480
00:28:02,778 --> 00:28:04,479
- What is this?
- It's the last of the money I owe him.

481
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,248
Took me a while to get it.

482
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,552
Do you want something to drink or anything?

483
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,252
No, I'm good.

484
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:11,455
What happened to your leg?

485
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,390
Oh, I had an accident skateboarding.

486
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:16,892
It's kind of hard to explain.

487
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:21,064
What happened between you and Mona?

488
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:23,799
Nothing. Nothing.

489
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,966
I haven't spoken to her in months.

490
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:27,270
Does Mona have something on you, Lucas?

491
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:30,539
Did you do something
that you really regret?

492
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,308
Did someone stab you in
that leg on Halloween?

493
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:36,511
- We'll talk about this another time.
- No, I need answers.

494
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:39,049
Why is she suddenly back at school?
Why is she coming back?

495
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,218
Hanna, yesterday wasn't her first day back.

496
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:45,552
She was sneaking out of there way
before she had the doctor's permission.

497
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:48,525
Why? Where was she going?
What was she doing?

498
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,526
I'm sorry.

499
00:28:50,527 --> 00:28:52,562
I'm sorry. That's the best that I can do.

500
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:55,498
Okay. I get it.

501
00:28:57,434 --> 00:28:59,201
I miss you.

502
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:02,905
I miss you, too.

503
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,021
I know that you ultimately have to own up.

504
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:21,824
Own up to what you've done,

505
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:24,894
and what's been done to you,

506
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:27,830
and then you have to learn to forgive...

507
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:29,465
she shoots, she scores.

508
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:31,100
Un-freakin'-believable.

509
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:33,369
By Tuesday, that'll be playing

510
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,439
in airports and doctor's offices.

511
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:39,775
We need more bottles.

512
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,085
I don't believe it.

513
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:54,323
What is she doing here?

514
00:29:57,494 --> 00:29:58,527
Spence.

515
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,531
Hey, Spencer, how are you?

516
00:30:02,532 --> 00:30:04,400
I'm good. How are you?

517
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:09,973
She's such a piece of work.

518
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,142
Yep. That's called greeting your converts.

519
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,514
Can I ask you something?

520
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,087
Have you ever...

521
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:27,257
Thought about what your life would be like

522
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,558
if your dad had been around

523
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,894
when you were, like, six or seven?

524
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,765
Dumb question. I shouldn't have asked that.

525
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:39,835
No. No, it wasn't dumb.

526
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:41,871
When I was young,

527
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:45,007
I... I looked for him everywhere.

528
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:48,210
In the streets, in stores.

529
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:51,213
I even looked for him in my sleep.

530
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,483
But when I was about 13, I just stopped.

531
00:30:56,853 --> 00:30:58,420
Why?

532
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:01,754
I guess I was just tired of...

533
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:03,960
Using all that energy, ya know.

534
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:06,428
I just needed to focus on me.

535
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:10,867
And I'm totally fine with
the way things turned out.

536
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,468
Really.

537
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:15,337
But... I'd be lying

538
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:17,339
if I said there weren't days

539
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,443
that I wish I could replace
the guy I made up in my head

540
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:22,378
with a real person.

541
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:32,954
Woman on P.A.: If you look at your maps,

542
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:34,524
you'll see four checkpoint stations.

543
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,426
The run will end in front of the school,

544
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:39,360
where you'll pick up your medal

545
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:40,995
and a complimentary swag bag.

546
00:31:40,996 --> 00:31:42,964
We will begin in three minutes.

547
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:45,033
Excuse me. Who's singing
the national anthem?

548
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:46,836
- We really didn't plan on...
- I'll do that.

550

00:31:55,378 --> 00:31:57,011
we can cut through the woods behind school.

552
00:31:57,012 --> 00:31:58,446
How are we getting in?

553
00:31:58,447 --> 00:32:00,481
It's not locked. They're keeping
the bathrooms open for people

554
00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:02,283
that are working the finish line.

555
00:32:02,284 --> 00:32:04,018
Are you sure that Emily can't meet us?

556
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:06,456
Yeah, unless she can escape fort fields.

557
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,291
Why is your grandmother singing?

558
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:11,493

You okay here by yourself?

568
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:45,560
Yeah. Is there an app to let
me crack open a window?

569
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:48,431
Don't need to. I'll adjust
the thermostat downstairs.

570
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:14,590
Okay, I'll be back in a couple of hours.

571
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:49,191
Emily?

572
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:50,926
Em, how did you get here?

573
00:33:50,927 --> 00:33:52,527
Long story. Just do me a favor.

574
00:33:52,528 --> 00:33:54,331
Don't call or text me until tomorrow.

575
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,764
This isn't working.

576
00:33:55,765 --> 00:33:57,033
That's because it's a paper clip.

577
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:59,068
You have to use a Bobby pin.

578
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:01,136
Have I taught you nothing?

579
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:13,483
The bag was right here, wasn't it?

580
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:22,458
That's the book he was writing in.

581
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,394
What does it say?

582
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:28,029
Looks like he was writing
a long letter to Mona,

583
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,164
'cause he thinks that
this is her diary. - Is it?

584
00:34:30,165 --> 00:34:31,499
Was this in the motel room?

585
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,903
Yeah, it was, but, you
guys, this isn't Mona's.

586
00:34:33,904 --> 00:34:36,372
This is Ali's.

587
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:57,427
Is this the same one you
saw in Mona's lair?

588
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:01,965
- I'm positive.
- Let me see this.

589
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,433
Aria, is this about your dad?

590
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:10,406
So you're department chair now.

591
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:13,409
You're a powerful man, Mr. Montgomery.

592
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:18,347
We're not having this conversation again.

593
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:21,383
Fine. I'd rather not talk.

594
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:23,819
That's gonna cost you.

595
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:27,488
- Same amount works for me.
- Oh, does it?

596
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:29,090
Well, you're out of luck.

597
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:31,127
That person's not in my life anymore.

598
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,494
It ended months ago.

599
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:34,329
Oh.

600
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,663
Will that make it any easier for Mrs.
Montgomery?

601
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:40,402
I mean, it did happen.

602
00:35:40,403 --> 00:35:41,938
It's time for you to go, Alison.

603
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,306
If a student called the Dean

604
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:46,174
and told him that Meredith was flipping out

605
00:35:46,175 --> 00:35:47,510
because one of her professors

606
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:49,945
wiped his feet on her after he...

607
00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:52,348
you make that call, you'll be very sorry.

608
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:55,682
You're right. I'll just
start with your wife.

609
00:36:08,531 --> 00:36:10,799
Maybe I'll call when I'm alone.

610
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,367
I cannot give you that kind of money again.

611
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:14,902
Ella will know it's missing.

612
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:17,307
You can take some time to figure it out.

613
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,641
I'm leaving town to visit my Nana.

614
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,445
I'll be back labor day weekend.

615
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,146
Does that work for you?

616
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:26,949
Excellent. I'll see you then.

617
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:34,156
Have a nice week, Mr. Montgomery.

618
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:48,337
Aria - don't.

619
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:51,038
- ( Door slamming )
- Emily, put this in your jacket.

620
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,773
Maybe we should leave it here.

621
00:36:52,774 --> 00:36:54,976
If he knows that it's missing,
he'll think it was one of us.

622
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:56,978
Us? He doesn't even know who you are.

623
00:36:56,979 --> 00:36:58,448
- Just take it.
- Give it to me.

624
00:37:04,254 --> 00:37:06,055
What are you doing down here?

625
00:37:07,423 --> 00:37:10,756
Um, all of the bathrooms
upstairs were full,

626
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:13,897
so we came down here, but we can
use the ones on the second floor.

627
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,331
We're sorry. You guys, come on.

628
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:21,971
- What have you got there?
- Give it to me!

629
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:26,074
Spencer?

630
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:29,277
- What's going on? Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

631
00:37:29,278 --> 00:37:31,439
We just had to get something
I accidentally threw away.

632
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:40,388
Thank God you came down there.

633
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,089
How did you know we were there?

634
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,958
I got to the finish line early,

635
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:46,794
and then, I saw the three of
you go in that back door.

636
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:49,076
It doesn't even matter. We're
just so lucky you were here.

637
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:53,335
( Explosion, woman screaming )

638
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:54,336
Oh, my God!

639
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:55,804
Woman: Mona!

640
00:37:57,974 --> 00:38:00,342
- Man: Get back!
- Mona!

641
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:11,657
No, I didn't get any messages.

642
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:13,959
Only my daughter's.

643
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,161
We accidentally switched phones.

644
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:17,696
That's right.

645
00:38:17,697 --> 00:38:20,999
Thanks for the update, sir. Good night.

646
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,168
That was your principal.

647
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:26,438
It was that new teacher, miss Sorenson,

648
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:28,473
- who got hurt by that stunt.
- Meredith?

649
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,510
You call her by her first name?

650
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:33,679
No, I just... she's...

651
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,014
Never mind.

652
00:38:38,017 --> 00:38:41,019
All right. Maybe we should stop fighting

653
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,987
about why I won't let you out,

654
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,258
and start talking about why
you're not letting me in.

655
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:50,362
Have I been gone that long?

656
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,667
Emmy, I know that I don't fully understand

657
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,072
everything that you've been going through.

658
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:04,409
But I know what it's like to lose people.

659
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,412
And the only thing that
gets me through that

660
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:11,017
is knowing that I'm
coming home to my family.

661
00:39:19,092 --> 00:39:21,261
I don't wanna be your gate keeper, Emma.

662
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:23,462
I wanna be your dad.

663
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:39,909
Ever since I was little, and
all through junior high...

664
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:45,317
Baby.

665
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:48,288
I think you've seen enough of
her for one day, don't you?

666
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:01,233
( Knocking at door )

667
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:06,505
How's Meredith?

668
00:40:06,506 --> 00:40:09,608
I just took her home from the E.R.

669
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:11,175
Doctors dressed her burn,

670
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,379
gave her some painkillers, kept her calm.

671
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,215
I didn't think she should be home alone,

672
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:18,051
so I invited her to stay over.

673
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:19,384
- She's here?
- No.

674
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:21,354
No, she didn't see that
as a very tempting offer,

675
00:40:21,355 --> 00:40:24,423
based on what happened earlier tonight.

676
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,626
What is it?

677
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:35,068
It was put on Meredith's clipboard,

678
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:38,270
sending her over to the storage shed.

679
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:41,172
- Did one of your friends write that?
- My friends?

680
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:42,976
I know what they're capable of.

681
00:40:42,977 --> 00:40:45,577
What are you saying?

682
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:51,382
- Does Meredith think that we sent this to her?
- Yeah, she sure does.

683
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:54,585
Now that she's told me the truth about
what happened on that first day,

684
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:56,287
I don't think it's such a crazy thought.

685
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:59,092
- Dad, we would never...
- Did you and your friends do this to her?

686
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:01,226
Yes or no?

687
00:41:01,227 --> 00:41:03,328
No.

688
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:06,198
No. Speak up now, Aria, while you can.

689
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,201
These kind of secrets
come back to haunt us.

690
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:10,270
What about yours?

691
00:41:11,604 --> 00:41:13,272
What does that mean?

692
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:16,575
Nothing.

693
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:19,344
Nothing.

694
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:22,180
Will you close my door, please?

695
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:37,195
( Zapping noise )

696
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:43,101
Hey.

697
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:50,343
Heard I missed some fireworks
at the finish line.

698
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,110
Yeah.

699
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:55,213
But Mona walked away without a scratch.

700
00:41:59,652 --> 00:42:02,388
- Look, I won't say this again.
- You don't have to.

701
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:05,290
I hear you this time.

702
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:13,198
Good night.

703
00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:17,669
( Cell phone rings )

704
00:42:20,406 --> 00:42:22,040
Hey, Aria, what's up?

705
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,543
"A" set us up.
What?

706
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:27,478
That's why Meredith opened that shed.

707
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:29,547
"A" sent her over there, and
made it look like we did.

708
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:31,349
Does "a" go by the name of Mona?

709
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:34,618
Is this her way of proving
to us that she's worthy?

710
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,120
- Hey, I gotta go.
- Wait, Aria.

711
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:39,256
Is it your dad? Do you wanna
come over and stay at my place?

712
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:41,260
He's never gonna let that happen.

713
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:54,735
I think this bandage will cover it.

714
00:42:54,736 --> 00:42:56,571
Ouch.

715
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:40,599
( Screaming )

716
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,759
