1
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:39,672
Aw, crap.

2
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,841
Morning, sleepyhead.

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,778
God, what did I do?

4
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,546
Me.

5
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,714
Several times, actually.

6
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,483
Don't you remember?

7
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,687
I was really drunk.

8
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,455
Ow, I wasn't thinking.

9
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,658
Um, we've both know we've been thinking

10
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,360
about doing that for a while now.

11
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,595
It was only a matter of time.

12
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,496
I never should've come here.

13
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,532
What are you doing? I thought
we'd spend the day together.

14
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,534
I've got school.

15
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,004
Well, you had a good time
last night though, didn't you?

16
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,173
That's not the point, okay?

17
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,108
It was a mistake, Sutton.

18
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,112
Can I have my shirt back?

19
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,987
This is because of Emma, isn't it?

20
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,623
I'm... I'm just really sorry
about the whole thing, okay?

21
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,691
Well, you didn't seem to
be too sorry last night.

22
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,994
I... I know... y... you're right.

23
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,597
You're right and that
just was not fair to you.

24
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,766
I realize that and, um...

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,501
I promise it won't happen again.

26
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,496
- synced and corrected by chamallow -

27
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,499
You really shouldn't have
left the party so early.

28
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,601
You still had guests to entertain.

29
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,735
Like Laurel Mercer?

30
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,672
Admit it: she's just a way for
you to get closer to her dad.

31
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,374
Maybe, but I'd play along if I were you.

32
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,609
'Cause it be a real shame

33
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,778
if some of your past mistakes
were to come to light.

34
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,413
Wouldn't it?

35
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,317
You know what?

36
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,451
We can talk about this later.

37
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,619
'Cause you're late for school.

38
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,721
I hate it when you get parental on me.

39
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,461
Sutton?

40
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,463
How many times do I have to tell you?

41
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,565
I'm sorry, but this is an emergency.

42
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,435
I slept with Ethan.

43
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,437
That's not an emergency.

44
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,638
Unless, of course,

45
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,506
you didn't use protection?

46
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,475
No, I did.

47
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,446
He... he freaked out this morning.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,481
And told me that he
wished it didn't happen.

49
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,383
I'm so sorry, Sutton.

50
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,517
Boys can be so cruel.

51
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,453
This is her fault.

52
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,522
If I could just get rid of Emma,
Ethan will forget about her.

53
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,291
She's your sister.

54
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,459
Someday we're going to be a family again.

55
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,361
And you need to get along with her.

56
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,429
He's holding out hope for her.

57
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,465
Just like your father.

58
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,701
Holding out hope for Kristin.

59
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:27,439
Amazing how you can make
my problems all about you.

60
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,475
The truth is, you could
learn by my example.

61
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,777
Ted and I kind of had a moment last night.

62
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,313
Yay for you.

63
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,317
Yay for you too.

64
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,786
If you follow my lead.

65
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,724
I don't give up so easily,
and neither should you.

66
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:59,538
All right, thanks for the ride, man.

67
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,473
Where the hell you been all night?

68
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,642
Screwing up like usual.

69
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,310
You know?

70
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,446
I had to hitch a ride.

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,348
You're damn right you screwed up.

72
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,382
Your teacher called.

73
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,351
Mr. Beattie?

74
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,420
You plagiarize a paper?

75
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,456
Sounds like you already
know the answer to that.

76
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,490
Yeah, he ran it through some software.

77
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:19,725
Found out it was bought online.

78
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,693
Dan, I know I shouldn't
have done that, okay?

79
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,362
Save it, Ethan.

80
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,264
I can't let you go back to juvie.

81
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,266
So I got Beattie to
give you a second chance.

82
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,468
You're going to take an
exam on all the coursework.

83
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:33,172
It's real simple: you pass
the test, you pass the course.

84
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,941
Okay, thanks.

85
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,075
When is the test?

86
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,177
Tomorrow morning.

87
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,978
It's tomorrow morning?

88
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,914
How am I going to pass
a test tomorrow morning?

89
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,081
I don't know, but you better figure it out

90
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,596
because your whole life depends on it.

91
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,623
What happened to your eye?

92
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,659
I'm just making friends.

93
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,628
Everybody in jail loves the D.A.

94
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,563
Let me get this straight.

95
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:01,333
Dan, our Dan,

96
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,470
came up with this crazy theory
that I'm trying to frame myself?

97
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,538
You know it makes more
sense than your own theory.

98
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,140
After all, it was a man

99
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,508
who called the waitress to set you up.

100
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,076
Rebecca could've done that.

101
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,144
She could've hired someone.

102
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,280
Or... you made the call yourself.

103
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,850
I thought you were trying
to represent me here.

104
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,017
The objective was to get me out of jail.

105
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,786
Whose side are you on?

106
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,721
When you hired me, you told me

107
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,823
that if you could convince
me of your innocence,

108
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,725
you could convince a jury too. Well...

109
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,962
I'm not as convinced as I used to be.

110
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,466
Pull the waitress's phone records.

111
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,336
That'll prove I didn't make the call.

112
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,505
Dan's already on it.

113
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,306
Should have them this afternoon.

114
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,309
You know, Theresa, you really ought

115
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,511
to keep your eye on the ball.

116
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:50,115
Rebecca's pulling the strings on this one.

117
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,352
Not me.

118
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,020
I heard the strange ringtone

119
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:58,156
and I found this hidden in the garage.

120
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,692
- A cell phone?
- Yeah.

121
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,895
I thought the police already
searched your whole house.

122
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,889
Well, I know, it's weird
that they didn't find it,

123
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,599
but it's got to be my dad's,
so I have to turn it in.

124
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,868
No, hold on, we need to check
it and see who he called.

125
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:10,969
I already did.

126
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,638
All incoming calls were blocked.

127
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,673
And if he made any calls
out, he cleared the log.

128
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,442
Can't you hack into it
and see what he deleted?

129
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,778
But that might be considered
tampering with evidence.

130
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,680
Thayer, this is going to be our only way

131
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,682
we're gonna know what he's
been up to all this time.

132
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,650
Please?

133
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,385
Can you just try?

134
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,121
Okay.

135
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,556
Thank you.

136
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,058
You're welcome.

137
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,496
Aren't they adorable?

138
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,065
I can't believe they finally got together.

139
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,234
She's coming.

140
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,302
Uh, act natural.

141
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,041
Oh, hi.

142
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,043
- Hey, how's everything?
- Hey.

143
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,012
Everything is fine.

144
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,147
Were you spying on me?

145
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,949
Us?

146
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,017
No.

147
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,919
Just came in here to brush my hair.

148
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,588
With my brush?

149
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,556
Okay, we were totally spying.

150
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,591
Oh, my God.

151
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,427
You and Thayer... this is awesome.

152
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,430
Way to hold firm, Laurel.

153
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,732
Mads, you should've come
out and talked to him.

154
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,434
Especially after what happened last night.

155
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,337
Well, his lips seemed pretty busy just now.

156
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,238
So, I figured I'd do it later.

157
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,573
Okay, listen, not to
make this all about me,

158
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,142
but I need to ask you guys a question.

159
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,280
What do you think about
me asking Jordan out?

160
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,119
Okay...

161
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,087
terrible idea.

162
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,155
No...

163
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,024
How well do you know him?

164
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,759
What? You think he's out of my league?

165
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,861
No, of course not.

166
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:43,795
I just think that...

167
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,063
I think you guys'd be great together.

168
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,898
You should totally go
for it. No reason not to.

169
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,903
This is disgusting!

170
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,672
What is this?

171
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,374
God!

172
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,508
- What's going on?
- Are you okay?

173
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,477
Well, the sink is clogged.

174
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,446
Ew, well, maybe Dad could fix it.

175
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,582
No, I don't want to have
to rely on him right now.

176
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,283
I can take care of this myself.

177
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,618
But I thought therapy went well.

178
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,254
That doesn't mean we are
getting back together.

179
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,356
Have you tried the disposal?

180
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,524
Maybe that'll clear it?

181
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,259
That is a very good idea.

182
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,327
You see, girls?

183
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,521
We can handle this ourselves.

184
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,901
Oh, my God.

185
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,074
Um, I'll call a plumber.

186
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,917
Dude.

187
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,953
You and Sutton Mercer
back together again, huh?

188
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,989
Look, I might've seen her when
I dropped you at the cabin.

189
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,183
I mean, that girl moves fast.

190
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,692
Nothing happened, okay?

191
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,826
No, like literally fast.

192
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,960
Like The Flash.

193
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,696
You know, she was at the party one minute,

194
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,830
then the cabin the next.

195
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,066
She must've taken a shortcut.

196
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,636
So, she races down there
for a secret rendezvous,

197
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,037
and you guys don't even hook up?

198
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,039
Come on, you don't really expect
me to believe that, do you?

199
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,841
Jordan, you need to keep your mouth shut.

200
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,676
All right?

201
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,777
You didn't see anything.

202
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:06,778
Got it?

203
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,780
Got it.

204
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:12,551
She wasn't there.

205
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,487
And she's definitely
not down the hall either.

206
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,696
Ladies.

207
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,202
He was totally checking you out.

208
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,603
Ew, he's my stepbrother.

209
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,238
Regardless, you have to tell Laurel

210
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,306
that you hooked up with him.

211
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,440
You heard her this morning.

212
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,209
She was talking about asking him out.

213
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,111
It was a meaningless one-time thing,

214
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,179
and we've agreed never
to speak about it again.

215
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,247
It's like it didn't even happen.

216
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,049
But it did happen.

217
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,251
I'm late for Bio.

218
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,891
Cleaning out?

219
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,893
Dropping out, actually.

220
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,896
Beattie found out I plagiarized
that World Civ paper.

221
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,732
So, now I'm history.

222
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,568
Not that it's any your business.

223
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,736
Well, won't you go back to juvie.

224
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,538
Well, maybe that's where I belong.

225
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,608
No, Ethan, there has to
be something you can do.

226
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,209
Yeah, there's a test I'd have

227
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,246
to pass tomorrow on
all the course material,

228
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,348
but I can't do that
because I'm too far behind,

229
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,022
which is why I cheated in the first place.

230
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,552
Wait.

231
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,254
What?

232
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,456
I'll tutor you.

233
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,459
Why do you even care?

234
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,928
After everything I did.

235
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,163
Aren't you with Thayer now?

236
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,265
Oh, come on. This has
nothing to do with him.

237
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,066
This is about your future.

238
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,234
You can't just give up.

239
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,004
Please, just let me help you.

240
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:54,669
Whoa, oops.

241
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:58,673
Excuse me.

242
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,008
Let me help.

243
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,077
Oh, my gosh, I'm such a klutz.

244
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:04,579
Maybe they should put warning
labels on these things.

245
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:05,981
You're hilarious.

246
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,649
Um, hey, look,

247
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:10,585
I know this is really short notice, um,

248
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:13,421
but DJ Beat Baron is
spinning tonight at Hangar 19.

249
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:15,657
And I was thinking of going.

250
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,425
Would you want to come?

251
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,527
I didn't even know that
Beat Baron was in town.

252
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:21,296
His mixes are so sick.

253
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,630
So, you in?

254
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:24,499
Yeah, for sure.

255
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:26,501
Um, pick up around 7:00?

256
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:27,602
It's a date.

257
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:29,337
I mean, a date in the calendar

258
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:31,373
sense of the word. Right.

259
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:32,374
All right, I'll see you then.

260
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:33,341
Okay.

261
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:37,212
Woo.

262
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:41,383
Mads, I thought you said
you wanted to apologize.

263
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,418
I am apologizing.

264
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,987
For last night, but not
for thinking Dad's innocent.

265
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:46,988
I told you, he said...

266
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:48,223
I don't care what he said.

267
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:50,759
He's playing you just
like he plays everyone.

268
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,094
Guys?

269
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,829
Everything okay?

270
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:55,997
Yeah, fine.

271
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:57,632
No, it's not fine.

272
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,701
Rebecca, tell him about the fingerprint

273
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:00,869
they found on the golf bag.

274
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,537
They can prove that Dad's been set up,

275
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:03,838
just like he's been saying all along.

276
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:06,408
Well, I didn't want to
get anybody's hopes up,

277
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:09,444
but things are looking a lot better now.

278
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,579
Well, I wouldn't pop
that champagne just yet.

279
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,381
Excuse me, guys. I have work to do.

280
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,116
Wait. We weren't finished talking.

281
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,251
Thayer, stay.

282
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,452
Why don't we all go to dinner together?

283
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,054
My treat.

284
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,188
Sutton and I are playing tennis tonight.

285
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:22,957
She has regionals coming up. Sorry.

286
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:26,294
He just won't listen.

287
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,929
Oh, he'll come around.

288
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,031
Mads, it's you

289
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,966
that I'm actually worried about.

290
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,968
Between all of this,
your dad being in jail,

291
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,838
living at the Mercers while
they're going through divorce.

292
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:38,973
Well, Ted and Kristin are
actually in therapy now.

293
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,608
So, things seem better.

294
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:41,776
Really?

295
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:43,511
Yeah.

296
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,647
That's so good to hear.

297
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:51,352
Oh, good, you made it.

298
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:52,687
I didn't think you would get here so...

299
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,489
Wait a second.

300
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,559
I told the girls
specifically not to call you.

301
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:59,461
Really? 'Cause Laurel made it sound

302
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,296
like you were practically
begging me to come over.

303
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,331
Did they clog the drain too?

304
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,100
Wouldn't put it past them... our girls.

305
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,367
Pretty crafty.

306
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:08,169
Aww, what is this?

307
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,205
Lamb chops, some kind of fish, chicken.

308
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,206
What are you thinking, piccata?

309
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,174
Parmigiana.

310
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,143
Mmm.

311
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:17,712
Kill for a home-cooked meal,
not that I'm hinting at anything.

312
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:18,980
Don't you think it's a
little early for that?

313
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:20,882
Right.

314
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,750
Speaking of which, I spoke
to Dr. Sandy's office.

315
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:25,620
She said she has a time
for us Monday at 10:00?

316
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:27,889
I actually have another
appointment at that time.

317
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,724
And I'm not...

318
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,593
I'm not sure that I
want to cancel it, so...

319
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:32,727
No pressure, that's fine.

320
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,696
Just let me know.

321
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,543
I have to rent a rooter for this,

322
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:38,233
- so can you wait till tomorrow?
- Sure.

323
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:43,304
The call to Jessica Whitman
was made from a burner cell,

324
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,240
so chances are it's been destroyed by now.

325
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:48,443
In other words, anyone could've
called her, including Alec.

326
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:49,978
Which is why I called his secretary

327
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,980
to check his schedule that day.

328
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:54,149
And from that look, I'm
guessing you found something.

329
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:56,117
He took off early.

330
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:59,187
Was gone all afternoon. Didn't say where.

331
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:00,922
Huh, that's interesting.

332
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,857
Yeah, huh.

333
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:04,819
I'm so sorry. I have to

334
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:06,621
bail on you for tennis. Something came up.

335
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:07,956
Well, whatever it is, it should wait

336
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,759
because I found out who my dad
called with that cell phone.

337
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:14,863
Apparently, he made one
call to a Jessica Whitman.

338
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,465
Number's been disconnected, but
I figured we could work together

339
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,633
and try and find her.

340
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,503
I can't tonight.

341
00:14:21,537 --> 00:14:23,405
But...

342
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:24,606
but you can do it without me.

343
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,242
I'll call you later, okay?

344
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:31,079
Wait, they're getting along now?

345
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:32,414
I thought they hated each other.

346
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:35,316
That was during the Seven Years' War.

347
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:38,319
During World War I, France
and England were allies.

348
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:40,121
Well, how am I supposed
to keep this stuff straight

349
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:42,090
if even they can't decide who likes who?

350
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:44,092
This is worse than high school.

351
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:47,796
Maybe if you just focus
and put the ball down.

352
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:50,899
I am focused.

353
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,534
I really am.

354
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:54,436
But I am focusing on how this is going

355
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,438
to be a huge waste of my time.

356
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:58,540
You're right.

357
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:00,408
I can't teach you if
you don't want to learn.

358
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:02,544
So have fun in juvie.

359
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:06,247
All right, wait, wait.
Hang on a second, okay?

360
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:09,584
I just feel like I don't deserve this.

361
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,319
What?

362
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:13,488
Your help.

363
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:18,960
Okay.

364
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:20,895
You made a mistake, Ethan.

365
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,934
And now you have a chance to make it right.

366
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:30,004
Ethan, I believe in you.

367
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,544
Emma, I have to tell you something.

368
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,848
I...

369
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:51,159
Well, hope I'm not interrupting anything.

370
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:52,460
Sutton, are you crazy?

371
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:54,095
Oh, would you relax?

372
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,263
I checked to make sure
Dan was still at work.

373
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:59,934
I was stopping by to see if Ethan
wanted to join me for dinner,

374
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:04,005
but, apparently, he has plans.

375
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,106
It's not what you think, all right?

376
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:06,808
I've... I've got a test tomorrow.

377
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,209
We're... we're studying. She's helping me.

378
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:10,945
Oh, well, that's really sweet.

379
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,680
I approve.

380
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:14,048
Seriously?

381
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,617
Yes, seriously, we don't want lover boy

382
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:17,952
to end up back in juvie now, do we?

383
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:19,554
Lover boy?

384
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:20,855
Oh, come on. It's a figure of speech.

385
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,557
We really have a lot
of work to do right now.

386
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:26,427
Okay, well, then I will leave you these.

387
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:27,595
Just for a little snack.

388
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,297
For later.

389
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:30,532
It's from that favorite
barbeque place you like.

390
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:34,135
Good luck tomorrow.

391
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,470
He doesn't need luck.

392
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:39,107
He has me.

393
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:45,380
You should have seen her.

394
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:47,527
Playing all innocent.

395
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:50,364
I'm telling you that if
I would have stayed there,

396
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:52,318
Alec wouldn't be the only
one in jail for murder.

397
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,266
You're going to be a lot happier

398
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:54,468
after you hear what I have to say.

399
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:56,470
What could you possibly say
that would make me feel better?

400
00:16:56,504 --> 00:17:00,040
I want you...

401
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,242
to take your life back from Emma.

402
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:05,245
Since when is switching back
ever been part of the plan?

403
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,114
It's just there's only so much I can do

404
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:08,815
to keep Ted and Kristin apart.

405
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,819
So, you want me to work from
the inside to split them up?

406
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:14,921
Well, think about it this way:

407
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:16,890
Emma will be here in isolation,

408
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:18,959
while you're out and about,

409
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,728
which means you'll have
Ethan all to yourself.

410
00:17:21,763 --> 00:17:24,498
You know she's not going
to do this willingly

411
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:27,367
Mmm, you're going to have to
find a way to persuade her.

412
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:29,403
Don't let me down, pumpkin.

413
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:36,543
Mads.

414
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,211
Hi.

415
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:40,047
Am I at the right house?

416
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:42,049
Yeah, I'm just staying
here for a little bit.

417
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,150
Come on in.

418
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:45,352
Laurel, uh, should be ready in a minute.

419
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:48,889
Sorry, I didn't realize you'd be here.

420
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:50,023
Guess this is kind of awkward.

421
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:52,025
Why would it be awkward?

422
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,795
Gotcha.

423
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:57,064
All set. Thanks for entertaining him.

424
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:58,899
Yeah, not a problem. You two have fun.

425
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:01,034
Hey, do you want to come?

426
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:02,035
Uh, I can't.

427
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,737
I don't want to impose.

428
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:05,639
Are you kidding? We're just hanging out.

429
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:07,607
Mm-hmm.

430
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:08,642
But I thought...

431
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:10,444
No, you should come.

432
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:12,646
It's not like it's a date or anything.

433
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:18,351
Jordan, can you give us a sec?

434
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:19,619
Okay, now you have to come with us.

435
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:21,688
No, I'm so not in the mood.

436
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:23,356
You were the one who
told me to ask him out,

437
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:25,325
and now I'm totally confused.

438
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,260
If you come along, you
can help me figure out

439
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:28,595
whether or not he's really into me or not.

440
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:31,531
Please?

441
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:35,469
Fine.

442
00:18:35,503 --> 00:18:37,304
- For the record...
- She's in. Let's roll.

443
00:18:42,143 --> 00:18:43,110
Not a word.

444
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:49,116
You left work early the day

445
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,951
that call to Jessica Whitman was made.

446
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:52,886
The only thing I'm guilty of is

447
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,921
leaving work early to play some golf.

448
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:56,790
And before you say anything,

449
00:18:56,824 --> 00:18:58,825
you're not allowed to have cell
phones on the golf course, okay?

450
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,893
We should get out next week.

451
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,094
What do you say? You free?

452
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:03,897
She is. You aren't.

453
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:06,666
Oh, think again, Danny Boy.

454
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:08,635
I've got a witness that'll back me up.

455
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:13,707
You two just gave me a
get-out-of-jail-free card.

456
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:26,259
Hey, sis.

457
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:27,594
You were out late.

458
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:30,230
Oh, you scared the crap out of me, Sutton.

459
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:31,331
Hey, you know, you should really get

460
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:32,332
these re-strung every now and then.

461
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:33,333
What do you think you're doing?

462
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,102
You can't go play tennis.

463
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:36,903
You're supposed to be staying out of sight.

464
00:19:36,938 --> 00:19:38,271
And you're supposed to be
practicing for regionals,

465
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,173
but that doesn't seem to stop you

466
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,743
from going over to
Ethan's and tutoring him.

467
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:45,045
I knew you were upset about that.

468
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,747
Oh, I'm not upset.

469
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:47,981
I'm thrilled that you're helping him.

470
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:49,649
Mm-hmm.

471
00:19:49,684 --> 00:19:51,451
I just don't want to lose regionals either.

472
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:52,419
You know, a lot is riding on it:

473
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:53,687
a chance to play D-1 tennis,

474
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:55,489
and scholarship.

475
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:56,790
Since when has any of that mattered to you?

476
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:58,658
Since I had a lot of time
to think up at that cabin.

477
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:00,460
And the fact of the matter
is, you and I are both going

478
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:02,329
to have to go to college someday.

479
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:05,265
Well, don't worry. I'm
ready for the tournament.

480
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:07,167
And I'm gonna win the scholarship.

481
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:11,138
Yeah, but a little bit
of practice wouldn't hurt.

482
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:14,307
So, I was thinking, I can
just give you some pointers.

483
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:15,408
We go out tomorrow.

484
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:16,977
Just for fun.

485
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,145
Someone will see us, Sutton.

486
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,246
Then, we'll do it across town.

487
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,814
No one will recognize us.

488
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:22,849
What is the big deal?

489
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:24,184
Why is this so important to you?

490
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:27,020
Geez, just thought I'd spend

491
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:28,121
some quality time with my sister,

492
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:29,956
but if you're not interested.

493
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:31,024
No.

494
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:34,694
Actually, I would love to.

495
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,398
You're on, sis.

496
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:39,699
Thanks for coming down.

497
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:41,601
Actually, I was already
planning on talking to you.

498
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:43,303
About what?

499
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,671
Well, you first. You said it was important.

500
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:46,506
Well, we need you to make a statement.

501
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,275
Some new evidence has come to light.

502
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:49,509
Someone called a waitress at the club

503
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:51,344
and paid her to plant the tire iron

504
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:52,445
in your father's golf bag.

505
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,181
- Wait. Somebody called?
- Yeah.

506
00:20:54,215 --> 00:20:56,416
What was the waitress's name?

507
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,352
Jessica Whitman.

508
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:02,355
Whoever called her set
your father up, Thayer.

509
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,292
Oh, my God. Dan, he wasn't set up.

510
00:21:05,326 --> 00:21:08,295
He's the one who called.

511
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:10,931
Hello, T.

512
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,232
- What the hell?
- It's okay, Thayer.

513
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:14,034
We just need to ask you some questions.

514
00:21:16,137 --> 00:21:17,737
Well, I've got some questions of my own.

515
00:21:17,772 --> 00:21:18,872
Like...

516
00:21:21,976 --> 00:21:23,844
how do you explain this, for example?

517
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:29,683
Dad?

518
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:38,550
How can you say you've
never seen that phone before?

519
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:41,974
- I found it in our house.
- If it was there the whole time,

520
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:44,009
why didn't the police find it
when the searched the house?

521
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,911
They must have missed it.

522
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:48,013
Come on. Look, whoever
planted the phone there,

523
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:50,849
planted it there after the search.

524
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:52,651
And then they called it

525
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,420
to be sure you'd find it.

526
00:21:54,454 --> 00:21:55,754
Or maybe you just screwed up.

527
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:58,490
And you didn't hide it as
well as you think you did.

528
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,359
I'm no fool, son.

529
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:01,393
- But you're a murderer.
- Okay,

530
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:02,561
that's enough.

531
00:22:02,595 --> 00:22:03,629
This isn't getting us anywhere.

532
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:05,230
I got the lab results.

533
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:06,305
Our techs confirmed that...

534
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,134
it is indeed the cell phone used

535
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:10,436
to call Jessica Whitman.

536
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,271
Ouch.

537
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:13,372
Case closed.

538
00:22:13,406 --> 00:22:15,040
They also determined

539
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:16,108
that the call to Jessica...

540
00:22:16,142 --> 00:22:18,911
was made from Flagstaff, Arizona.

541
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,780
Weren't we playing golf the exact time

542
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:23,982
that phone call was made?

543
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:25,784
Yeah, it was a Friday, right?

544
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,019
I remember it 'cause you beat me

545
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:28,954
by one... you birdied 18.

546
00:22:28,988 --> 00:22:30,723
- I know. I remember.
- So how could I be

547
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:32,524
playing golf with you in Scottsdale,

548
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,559
and also be in Flagstaff,

549
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:34,693
150 miles away?

550
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,495
I don't know. Maybe you hired someone.

551
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,331
Or maybe there's two of me.

552
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,634
Well, it backfired.

553
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:44,603
'Cause we got enough to go to the judge

554
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:46,372
and get the charges against you dropped.

555
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,407
Oh, my God. No, no, no, please, please,

556
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:50,476
- you can't let him out.
- T, face it...

557
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,044
You were wrong about everything,

558
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:53,159
and the only mistake I made

559
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:54,213
was taking your bastard ass in

560
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:57,116
when nobody else gave a crap about you.

561
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,250
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Okay, okay...

562
00:22:58,284 --> 00:22:59,918
Let's go. Let's go.

563
00:22:59,953 --> 00:23:01,220
Let's go.

564
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:06,258
Damn it. This can't be happening right now.

565
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:08,227
You dad's getting out
whether you like it or not.

566
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,863
You need to find a way to deal with that.

567
00:23:10,897 --> 00:23:13,065
Now go home and cool off.

568
00:23:17,237 --> 00:23:19,671
Hi, this is Lindsey Ridgeway's office

569
00:23:19,706 --> 00:23:20,939
reminding you of your
appointment for Monday

570
00:23:20,974 --> 00:23:23,642
at 10:00 a.m. Please
call us back to confirm.

571
00:23:25,058 --> 00:23:28,126
You're still going to meet
with your divorce attorney?

572
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:30,095
I don't know.

573
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:32,030
Maybe.

574
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:33,999
It turns out we have a therapy session

575
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:37,903
the exact same time, so I do
have to cancel one of them.

576
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:40,005
Do I get a vote on which one?

577
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,907
Oh, I already know your
vote, thank you very much,

578
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:43,942
and don't think I don't know
what you girls were up to

579
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:45,617
with the whole plumbing thing. You are not

580
00:23:45,645 --> 00:23:47,513
as clever as you think you are.

581
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:49,648
The point is, we would do anything

582
00:23:49,682 --> 00:23:51,350
to keep this family intact.

583
00:23:51,384 --> 00:23:53,352
And canceling on the divorce attorney

584
00:23:53,386 --> 00:23:55,287
is hardly going to extremes.

585
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:10,402
I like this place.

586
00:24:10,436 --> 00:24:12,271
What do you think, Mads?

587
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:15,274
I think there's too many people

588
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:17,042
trying too hard to be cool,

589
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:19,077
but I'm not surprised you like it.

590
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:21,013
Excuse me?

591
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:22,314
She's just kidding.

592
00:24:22,348 --> 00:24:23,982
You were just kidding, right?

593
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:25,284
Yes, and you would know, Laurel,

594
00:24:25,318 --> 00:24:27,986
because you have an amazing sense of humor,

595
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:29,054
an infectious laugh,

596
00:24:29,088 --> 00:24:30,956
great personality...

597
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,092
- Stop.
- Some might say that she is the total package.

598
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:35,894
Well, don't sell yourself short.

599
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:38,697
Ugh. Well, thank you, stepbrother.

600
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:39,798
I'm gonna go to the bar.

601
00:24:39,832 --> 00:24:40,899
Anyone want a drink?

602
00:24:40,934 --> 00:24:42,801
Sure. You want any help?

603
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:45,704
No. You stay here with
Laurel. I'll get the drinks.

604
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:48,373
- Well, at least let me buy.
- I really don't want your money.

605
00:24:48,408 --> 00:24:50,309
Hey, I'm sorry.

606
00:24:50,343 --> 00:24:51,577
Did I do something wrong?

607
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:52,744
Ha! There she goes again.

608
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:54,580
Hey, I'll just take a water.

609
00:24:54,614 --> 00:24:57,215
If that's cool.

610
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,350
What're you gonna drink, Mads?

611
00:24:58,384 --> 00:24:59,585
A Cosmo? Sex on the beach?

612
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:02,087
You know what? I'm gonna go home.

613
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:04,189
He's all yours. You two enjoy your evening.

614
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:08,160
Um, I'm really sorry.

615
00:25:08,194 --> 00:25:10,996
I have no idea what just happened.

616
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,331
Forget about it.

617
00:25:12,365 --> 00:25:14,199
It's fine.

618
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:15,934
Let's dance.

619
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:27,012
Hey.

620
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:28,714
- Hi.
- You playing today?

621
00:25:28,748 --> 00:25:30,882
No, I was just warming up.

622
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:35,754
I'm actually headed across town
to have a match with Sutton.

623
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:37,889
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm. It was her idea.

624
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:40,726
I'm sure she has some
sort of ulterior motive.

625
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,296
You guys are gonna just be alone together?

626
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,231
Yes, we're gonna be alone together.

627
00:25:46,265 --> 00:25:48,500
I can't wait to hear
what she has on her mind.

628
00:25:49,268 --> 00:25:51,169
Hey...

629
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:53,472
how did your test go?

630
00:25:53,506 --> 00:25:55,507
Uh, 73.

631
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:57,175
I passed.

632
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,179
- That's awesome.
- Yeah, well, I had a pretty good tutor.

633
00:26:01,214 --> 00:26:02,948
You think you might

634
00:26:02,982 --> 00:26:04,816
want to keep helping me with that stuff?

635
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:06,184
So I can stay a free man.

636
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:10,956
Yeah, I can do that. Yeah.

637
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,825
All right. Thanks.

638
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,661
Come here.

639
00:26:15,695 --> 00:26:17,696
I'm so happy for you.

640
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,698
Hey...

641
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,534
what's going on here?

642
00:26:22,568 --> 00:26:25,437
Um, I was just thanking her for helping me.

643
00:26:25,471 --> 00:26:27,439
Uh, she tutored me.

644
00:26:27,473 --> 00:26:28,707
Tutoring you?

645
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:30,475
Yeah. I thought you knew.

646
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,344
Uh, no, actually.

647
00:26:32,378 --> 00:26:34,279
Wait, hold on. So last night...

648
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:35,514
that's where you had to go?

649
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:38,283
The test was today.

650
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:40,285
Wow.

651
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,955
You know what? It doesn't matter.

652
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,123
Thayer...

653
00:26:51,062 --> 00:26:52,080
Alec is getting out?

654
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,208
The judge is signing off on it now.

655
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,300
It's obvious that he was framed.

656
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:58,602
Of course. By whom?

657
00:26:58,636 --> 00:27:01,605
Well, the call to the waitress
came from Flagstaff, Arizona.

658
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:04,141
Does that mean anything to you?

659
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:06,243
Flagstaff, uh, no.

660
00:27:06,277 --> 00:27:08,212
Not at all.

661
00:27:08,246 --> 00:27:10,981
Anyway, he should be out by this evening.

662
00:27:11,015 --> 00:27:12,282
You two should celebrate.

663
00:27:12,317 --> 00:27:15,085
Yes, I thought this day would never come.

664
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,821
Thank you so much, Theresa.

665
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,094
Hey, Ted, I just got

666
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:26,764
- the most amazing news.
- Really? What?

667
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:28,699
Alec's being released.

668
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:29,833
- Really?
- Yeah.

669
00:27:29,868 --> 00:27:31,535
Wow. That...

670
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:32,836
I didn't expect that.

671
00:27:32,871 --> 00:27:35,672
Neither was I.

672
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:38,308
Actually.

673
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:42,513
Well why are you so upset?

674
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:48,085
I'm scared, Ted.

675
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,354
It's just whenever I've gone to see

676
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:53,290
Alec in jail, I've gotten the feeling

677
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:56,360
that he might blame me for his arrest.

678
00:27:56,394 --> 00:27:57,928
Well, that's ridiculous.

679
00:27:57,962 --> 00:27:59,163
You've been more supportive than anyone.

680
00:27:59,197 --> 00:28:00,898
Yeah, well...

681
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:02,833
you know how he gets.

682
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:04,735
His temper.

683
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:06,904
Well, if you are that afraid,

684
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:08,839
why don't you leave town?

685
00:28:08,873 --> 00:28:10,808
Go back to L.A.?

686
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:13,610
You don't really mean that?

687
00:28:15,513 --> 00:28:16,780
I thought that...

688
00:28:16,815 --> 00:28:18,582
You thought wrong.

689
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:21,518
I see.

690
00:28:21,553 --> 00:28:24,455
Well, I can't...

691
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:26,457
run away, not again.

692
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:28,158
I mean, everything I love is here.

693
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:29,460
My roots are here.

694
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:32,296
My family is here.

695
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,199
You mean Jordan?

696
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:37,134
Who else would I mean?

697
00:28:37,168 --> 00:28:39,303
Well, I'm, I'm sorry.

698
00:28:39,337 --> 00:28:42,039
I shouldn't have fallen
apart on you like this.

699
00:28:42,073 --> 00:28:44,141
And I thank you for being there for me.

700
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:58,789
Thayer, hi. It's Emma again.

701
00:28:58,823 --> 00:29:00,657
Are you okay?

702
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:02,426
Please call me back.

703
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:05,762
Trouble in paradise?

704
00:29:05,797 --> 00:29:07,664
Are you sure nobody's
gonna recognize us here?

705
00:29:07,699 --> 00:29:08,820
Please, anyone worth knowing

706
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,467
wouldn't be caught dead here.

707
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:11,568
All right.

708
00:29:11,603 --> 00:29:14,371
You serve.

709
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:16,540
I'm sure you haven't played in a while.

710
00:29:16,574 --> 00:29:19,576
Always so considerate, Emma.

711
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:22,412
Well, care to make things interesting?

712
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:24,147
Well, what did you have in mind?

713
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:25,215
Well, whoever wins

714
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,950
is obviously the best player,

715
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:29,386
so she should be the one
that plays at regionals.

716
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,955
So that's what this is about.

717
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,290
You want to switch back.

718
00:29:33,324 --> 00:29:35,225
For a few days. Just for regionals.

719
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,960
Unless, of course,
you're too scared, then...

720
00:29:36,995 --> 00:29:38,795
you don't have to.

721
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,931
Oh, I'm not scared. You should be scared,

722
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:43,700
'cause I will wipe these courts with you.

723
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:46,069
Feisty, Emma.

724
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:48,805
Fine. We have a deal?

725
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,675
No, actually, I have some of my own terms.

726
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:52,709
Whoever loses...

727
00:29:52,744 --> 00:29:54,778
has to stay in the cabin.

728
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:56,647
For real this time.

729
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:58,749
Can't step foot out of it. Understand?

730
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:05,188
Good luck.

731
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:06,490
May the best sister win.

732
00:30:06,524 --> 00:30:08,392
Oh, I will.

733
00:30:08,426 --> 00:30:10,260
Oh, hey.

734
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:13,297
I wanted to apologize
for last night. I, um,

735
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:15,299
- I guess I kind of screwed things up.
- Oh, no.

736
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,401
Leaving was the best
thing you could've done.

737
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:19,202
I never should've asked you to come along.

738
00:30:19,237 --> 00:30:22,105
Oh, so things worked
out with you and Jordan?

739
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,141
We danced for a while and
talked for, like, hours

740
00:30:24,175 --> 00:30:26,877
about music and bands and life.

741
00:30:26,911 --> 00:30:29,680
He's so sweet and cute.

742
00:30:29,714 --> 00:30:31,882
I think we're gonna go out again next week.

743
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:34,818
Awesome. Well, I'm really happy for you.

744
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:35,919
Me, too.

745
00:30:35,954 --> 00:30:37,588
You're the best.

746
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:44,494
Hey, Thayer. What's up?

747
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:49,333
What?

748
00:30:58,142 --> 00:31:00,177
It's the first set. 6-2.

749
00:31:00,211 --> 00:31:02,079
You're on fire.

750
00:31:02,013 --> 00:31:03,080
Well,

751
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:04,348
we can quit if you want.

752
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:08,018
No, no. I'm just a little off.

753
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:10,187
Haven't really been getting
much sleep this week.

754
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:11,922
That's 'cause you're running around town

755
00:31:11,956 --> 00:31:13,824
when you should be up at
that cabin just relaxing.

756
00:31:13,858 --> 00:31:15,092
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard to relax

757
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:17,094
when Ethan just drops by
in the middle of the night.

758
00:31:17,128 --> 00:31:18,962
Excuse me.

759
00:31:18,997 --> 00:31:21,832
Oh...

760
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:24,868
after Jordan's party, he stopped by,

761
00:31:24,903 --> 00:31:27,638
and you said it was
fine, so I slept with him.

762
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,600
You're cool with that, right?

763
00:31:31,643 --> 00:31:33,410
Yeah, whatever. He can...

764
00:31:33,444 --> 00:31:35,546
he can do what he wants.

765
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,448
Good, 'cause I totally thought
you'd be, like, really upset.

766
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,484
I'm not.

767
00:31:40,518 --> 00:31:43,086
Obviously.

768
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:44,955
My serve.

769
00:31:59,971 --> 00:32:01,204
Hey.

770
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:04,775
The, um, the cam, um...

771
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:06,877
Chain tensioner.

772
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:07,878
Yeah, that's the one.

773
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,881
It's making noise again. Do
you mind taking a look at it?

774
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:12,716
All right.

775
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,820
Sutton's not here, is she?

776
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:19,723
Why would she be?

777
00:32:19,757 --> 00:32:21,458
Just asking.

778
00:32:21,492 --> 00:32:24,528
Never seem to know where
she's gonna pop up next.

779
00:32:24,562 --> 00:32:26,430
It didn't sound like
your tensioner, but, um,

780
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:28,365
we're probably gonna check
your plugs out, all right?

781
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,234
What's the deal with you guys anyways?

782
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:36,540
Look, it's, uh... it's complicated.

783
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:39,443
Okay, she used to be one person and...

784
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:42,145
now she's someone else.

785
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,381
And you don't know which one you like more.

786
00:32:44,415 --> 00:32:47,317
- Something like that, yeah.
- Chicks.

787
00:32:47,352 --> 00:32:49,987
Even when you know they're
completely wrong for you,

788
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:52,122
you still can't stop thinking about them.

789
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:54,725
Sounds to me like you're
the one with the problem.

790
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:56,026
Yeah, tell me about it.

791
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,028
But hey, I did see Sutton at the cabin.

792
00:32:58,062 --> 00:32:59,596
She's into you, man.

793
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:00,664
Like, hardcore into you.

794
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:01,832
If I were you,

795
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:03,500
I wouldn't overthink it.

796
00:33:03,534 --> 00:33:05,636
If I were you,

797
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,571
I wouldn't either.

798
00:33:40,438 --> 00:33:42,172
Emma!

799
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:44,241
Mads?

800
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:45,308
Time-out.

801
00:33:45,343 --> 00:33:46,424
Thank God I found you.

802
00:33:46,444 --> 00:33:48,211
- Hey.
- Hey.

803
00:33:48,246 --> 00:33:49,312
What's the matter?

804
00:33:49,347 --> 00:33:51,381
Thayer just called to say good-bye.

805
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:52,983
He's moving back to L.A.

806
00:33:53,017 --> 00:33:53,917
I guess things got pretty ugly

807
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:55,185
between him and my dad.

808
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:58,221
Oh, I knew something was wrong with him.

809
00:33:58,256 --> 00:34:01,058
Uh-oh. Drama.

810
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:02,092
I really wanted to make peace between them,

811
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:03,093
but he won't listen to me,

812
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:04,661
and Emma, I think you might be

813
00:34:04,696 --> 00:34:05,962
the only person who can keep him here.

814
00:34:05,997 --> 00:34:07,030
And you've got to hurry

815
00:34:07,065 --> 00:34:08,565
'cause he's packing right now.

816
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:10,934
Tick-tock.

817
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:14,538
Congratulations, Sutton.

818
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:16,339
You win. I forfeit.

819
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:38,627
Thayer.

820
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,463
You shouldn't have come, Emma.

821
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,399
I don't understand.

822
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,533
What happened with Alec?

823
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:46,568
He won, like he always does.

824
00:34:46,603 --> 00:34:48,504
He's getting out of jail,
so I can't stay here anymore.

825
00:34:48,538 --> 00:34:50,339
What, he's getting out?

826
00:34:50,373 --> 00:34:51,373
How?

827
00:34:51,408 --> 00:34:53,342
That phone I found exonerated him.

828
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:54,443
Can you believe that?

829
00:34:54,477 --> 00:34:56,378
Okay...

830
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,080
well, you don't have to leave.

831
00:34:58,114 --> 00:34:59,481
I mean, you could stay someplace else.

832
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,417
Emma, I don't really live here.

833
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:03,218
I only came back to help you and Sutton,

834
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:05,020
but every single time I do, it always leads

835
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:07,990
back to my father, and I
can't, I can't beat him.

836
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:14,196
It's killing me.

837
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,899
I'm sorry.

838
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:18,014
You know what, the truth is,

839
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,736
there is nothing left for me here anymore.

840
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,708
What about me?

841
00:35:25,742 --> 00:35:29,511
I'm... I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about Ethan, but...

842
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:30,612
It's not about that.

843
00:35:34,651 --> 00:35:36,552
I want you to come with me.

844
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,393
Uh... uh... Thayer, I can't do that.

845
00:35:44,427 --> 00:35:47,229
The Mercers are the only
family I've ever known.

846
00:35:47,263 --> 00:35:49,398
I can't leave them right now.

847
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,001
Well, I can't...

848
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:54,903
I can't stay either.

849
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:58,941
So then that's it?

850
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:02,745
Maybe it's for the best.

851
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:06,482
No, I... I...

852
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:24,366
Take care of yourself.

853
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:46,755
See? Good as new.

854
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,991
Guess I'll just get out of your way.

855
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:53,462
Ted, about that counseling
session on Monday.

856
00:36:53,496 --> 00:36:55,497
I'll be there.

857
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:56,865
What about your other appointment?

858
00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:00,602
I canceled it.

859
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,739
That's good to hear,

860
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:05,533
but I hope you brought
your checkbook, ma'am,

861
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:08,343
'cause you've rung up
quite a hefty plumbing bill.

862
00:37:11,147 --> 00:37:13,081
Chicken parmigiana?

863
00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:14,149
Leftovers.

864
00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:16,018
Looks like everything is getting

865
00:37:16,052 --> 00:37:19,021
back to normal around here.

866
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:21,323
Yes, your father fixed the drain.

867
00:37:21,357 --> 00:37:25,027
I wasn't talking about the plumbing.

868
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,974
Do you want me to get Laurel?

869
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,688
You know, honestly, I can't figure you out.

870
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,511
One minute, you're hot; the
next minute, you're cold.

871
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:43,612
Do you even know what you want?

872
00:37:43,646 --> 00:37:46,748
What about you? You're
practically stalking me.

873
00:37:46,783 --> 00:37:48,450
I am not interested, okay?

874
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:49,618
Oh, is that right?

875
00:37:49,652 --> 00:37:50,619
Yeah.

876
00:38:24,754 --> 00:38:27,956
Well, I love the smell
of freedom in the evening.

877
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:28,957
The press is at the other entrance,

878
00:38:28,992 --> 00:38:30,025
just like you requested.

879
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:31,860
Perfect.

880
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:33,729
There'll be plenty of time
for grandstanding later.

881
00:38:33,763 --> 00:38:35,597
Do you need a lift home?

882
00:38:35,632 --> 00:38:37,633
No.

883
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,935
I've got a stop to make.

884
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:47,442
Tell my wife I'm coming for her.

885
00:38:52,515 --> 00:38:54,616
You were in Flagstaff?

886
00:38:54,651 --> 00:38:56,618
You were supposed to make
that call from the golf course

887
00:38:56,653 --> 00:38:59,154
so no one would question it.

888
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:01,089
No, I don't want you to do anything.

889
00:39:01,124 --> 00:39:03,358
Alec will be here any minute.

890
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,329
I know exactly how to handle him.

891
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:28,550
Hey, baby, I'm home.

892
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:32,721
Darling, I've missed you so much.

893
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:41,563
I'll bet.

894
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:17,733
God, you scare easily.

895
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:19,768
Well, what do you expect?
There's a murderer out there.

896
00:40:19,802 --> 00:40:23,639
Hey, so, I'm really sorry
about the Thayer thing.

897
00:40:23,673 --> 00:40:25,674
Tough break, but a deal's a deal.

898
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:29,011
And if you remember, not one
foot outside of the cabin.

899
00:40:29,045 --> 00:40:30,846
Your terms, I recall.

900
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,514
And what if I refuse?

901
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:34,549
You wouldn't dare.

902
00:40:34,584 --> 00:40:35,784
Try me.

903
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:39,454
Shoot. I was afraid this would happen.

904
00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:42,557
See, I'm not going to go either, so...

905
00:40:42,592 --> 00:40:46,528
I think we're gonna just have to
tell the family our big secret,

906
00:40:46,562 --> 00:40:48,463
which is going to be really
tough because Kristin,

907
00:40:48,498 --> 00:40:49,731
I don't really know how
she's going to react.

908
00:40:49,766 --> 00:40:52,801
She's very fragile right now.

909
00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:54,736
You're bluffing.

910
00:40:54,771 --> 00:40:56,705
Try me.

911
00:41:01,577 --> 00:41:02,711
Fine.

912
00:41:02,745 --> 00:41:04,546
I'm leaving,

913
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,481
but Ted and Kristin are
making really good progress,

914
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:07,883
so just promise me that
you'll keep pushing them

915
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,718
in the right direction.

916
00:41:09,752 --> 00:41:12,821
Yes! Of course! They're my parents.

917
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:14,690
You think I don't want them together?

918
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:16,692
All right, I'll see you in a couple days.

919
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:18,627
I left some clean towels
for you at the cabin.

920
00:41:19,696 --> 00:41:20,862
You may need them.

921
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,732
See,

922
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:25,467
I can be considerate too, Emma.

923
00:41:26,903 --> 00:41:28,637
Good luck at regionals.

924
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:30,472
I don't need luck.
