1
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,739
In a town where everyone's dying
to couple up...

2
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,286
...sometimes there's nothing better
than being out of a relationship.

3
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,455
You have time to do your laundry...

4
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,491
...freedom to play your favorite
bad music really loudly.

5
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,050
But the best part of being
out of a relationship:

6
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,528
Plenty of time to catch up
with your friends.

7
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:09,057
I feel sorry for Big.
I really do, because if you think about it...

8
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:12,901
...I was the best thing that ever happened
to him. Actually, I pity him.

9
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:16,669
Because I get to walk away and be me
and he has to walk away and stay him.

10
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,711
Who wants to be him
when you can be me?

11
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,370
I'm smart. I'm funny.

12
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:25,441
I was this thing. I was it.
I was this magic moment.

13
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,815
I was the abracadabra.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,616
I was totally the "poof" in the relationship.

15
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,717
I've got more poof than he could ever have.

16
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,454
Sometimes, I poof just hailing a cab.

17
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,191
So, I guess it's better to know now
so I can go poof someone else.

18
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,755
Someone who deserves me...

19
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,531
...and not some screwed up, insecure guy
who can't deal with a woman...

20
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,162
...who's got her act together.

21
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:50,208
Now, I'm gonna end up deliriously happy
and Big is gonna die old and alone...

22
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,074
...and I pity him. Really, I pity him.

23
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,377
What?

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,285
Who's gonna tell her?

25
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,756
What?

26
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,623
You're obsessed with talking about Big
and frankly, we can't take it anymore.

27
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,162
- It's out of our league.
- Is this an intervention?

28
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,858
Yes, stop her before she obsesses again.

29
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:17,232
Isn't part of the breaking up process that
you get free rein to whine to your friends?

30
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,497
Of course you do.

31
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,369
But maybe you should think
about whining to a shrink.

32
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,101
Why should I pay someone
when we can talk for free...

33
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,042
...and then get a drink or whatever?

34
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,842
I don't need professional help.
I've got you guys.

35
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,506
For another ten minutes.

36
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,744
Then we're cutting you off, cold turkey.

37
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,211
Hey, I don't need therapy.
I need new friends.

38
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:40,623
Look, we're as fucked up as you are.
It's like the blind leading the blind.

39
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,628
Sometimes it helps
to talk to somebody who's objective.

40
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,530
Okay, I understand why you see a shrink
because you're always in your head...

41
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,759
...but I'm fine.

42
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,828
I am functioning. Besides, I don't really...

43
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,773
To be honest,
I just don't buy the whole shrink thing.

44
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,867
Neither do I. My parents believe...

45
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,946
...that any head problem can be solved
with physical exercise.

46
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,778
That's why all of us
are really good tennis players.

47
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,881
It's a slippery slope.

48
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,477
First you go once a week,
then three times a week...

49
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,112
...and next thing you know...

50
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,589
...you start sentences, "My shrink says..."

51
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,752
My shrink says that's a very common fear.

52
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:19,188
Therapy is just so self-indulgent.

53
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,499
Ancient man didn't need shrinks to survive.

54
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,628
Ancient man only lived till 30.

55
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,333
Were my friends right?

56
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,874
Had I crossed the line
from pleasantly neurotic...

57
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,534
...into annoyingly troubled?

58
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,135
I decided to seek
my own professional help.

59
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,473
How can you not have a shrink?

60
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,107
This is Manhattan.
Even the shrinks have shrinks.

61
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,015
The fact was, Stanford was right.

62
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,112
The therapist was as ubiquitous
in Manhattan as pirated cable.

63
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,281
I have three.

64
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,482
You do not.

65
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,559
I do:

66
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,490
One when I want to be cuddled...

67
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,256
...one when I want tough love...

68
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,493
...and one for when I just want to look at
a really beautiful man.

69
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,558
- That's sick.
- Which is why I see the other two.

70
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:00,003
- Do you want a name?
- No, Miranda's shrink referred me to one.

71
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,507
Dr. Ellen Greenfield.

72
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,136
Dr. G! My god! She is hot, hot, hot.

73
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,645
Gwyneth Paltrow sees her.

74
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,204
Why does she go to a shrink?

75
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,944
She suffers from high self-esteem.

76
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:17,582
While I was contemplating the couch,
Miranda was enjoying hers.

77
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,576
Two nights later,
she had another nocturnal rendezvous.

78
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:50,353
Soon, Miranda found herself
with a nightly playmate.

79
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,823
A week later, I kept my date with Dr. G,
celebrity shrink.

80
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,160
So Carrie, tell me why you're here.

81
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,932
Well, my friends can't handle me anymore.

82
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,467
You're like very expensive foster care.

83
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,206
What's bothering them?

84
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:15,137
They tell me that I talk
about my ex-boyfriend too much.

85
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,715
But that's normal, right, after a break up?

86
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,845
I don't like the term "normal."

87
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,356
No, of course you don't,
because you wouldn't have any patients.

88
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,018
So, tell me about him:

89
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:28,986
The ex.

90
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,928
You know, I have to be honest.

91
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,903
I'm not sure I really believe in therapy.

92
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,271
I'm more of a
"solve your own problems" kind of gal.

93
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,179
Okay.

94
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,818
I don't know.

95
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,252
He was smart.

96
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,893
He was sexy, just totally screwed up.

97
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:13,370
He was playing all these games,
and I didn't know the rules.

98
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,770
You were playing games.

99
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,436
No, he was. I was just along for the ride.

100
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,837
What about you?

101
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,946
Was this the first time you dated a man
who couldn't give you what you wanted?

102
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,313
Well, that's a little easy, don't you think?

103
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,260
Okay.

104
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,057
Yeah.

105
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,724
Maybe I've dated men
who were wrong for me, but who hasn't?

106
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,962
The thing they have in common is you.

107
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,272
- What's your point?
- Maybe you are picking the wrong men.

108
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,172
Well, of course you pick the wrong guys.
Jesus, I could have told you that.

109
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,377
Frankly, I think I picked
the wrong therapist.

110
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:04,815
She just did not get me at all.
She thought I was a game player.

111
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,484
You have to be.
It's the only way to deal with men.

112
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,619
That's healthy.
Relationships are not about games.

113
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,699
They're about mature
and honest communication.

114
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,530
This from a woman who plays peek-a-boo
with her neighbor.

115
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,001
Games are empowering.

116
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,335
If you know what you're doing,
you can control the situation.

117
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,138
The only place you can control a man
is in bed.

118
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:28,236
If we perpetually gave men blow jobs,
we could run the world.

119
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,544
At least our hands would be
free to greet dignitaries and stuff.

120
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,777
Sorry.

121
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,581
I mean, even if you're in a relationship...

122
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,747
...you still have to play games.

123
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,087
Big and I played games.
Look where it got us.

124
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,186
But maybe the game is not really over.
Maybe it's just halftime.

125
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,332
That kind of delusional thinking
is why you should be in therapy, too.

126
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,767
I do not pick the wrong guys.
They pick me.

127
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,963
So what, you're like a fly strip
for dysfunctional men?

128
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:59,037
Yeah, but one of those really
pretty floral scented ones.

129
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,240
It's slim pickings out there.

130
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,045
You can't swing a Fendi purse
without knocking over five losers.

131
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,747
Where did all the great guys go?

132
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,660
There it was:
Happy hour in the valley of lost men.

133
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,126
Hello.

134
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,289
I've never seen this many of them
rounded up in one space.

135
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,061
- What's going on?
- It's sports night.

136
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,499
It certainly is.

137
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,402
Come on, girls. Let the games begin.

138
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,375
Sports night: Every female's fantasy...

139
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,468
...a room full of captive heterosexual men...

140
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,845
...all looking to be distracted
during commercial breaks.

141
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,511
I'm getting a contact high
from all the testosterone.

142
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,817
- We didn't order these.
- They're on the house.

143
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,414
It's sports night. Ladies drink for free.

144
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,221
Forget Disneyland.
This is the happiest place on Earth.

145
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,491
Yes, indeed.

146
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,328
If you ladies will excuse me.

147
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,366
I'm getting on the bench.

148
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,078
- Who's winning?
- Knicks.

149
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:14,111
- Is that good?
- You're not a Knicks fan, I take it.

150
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,746
Not yet.

151
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,721
- I'm Don.
- Samantha.

152
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,624
Don Seglar was a very successful importer
of Mexican handbags.

153
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:26,631
He was fanatical about two things:
Keeping the price of foreign labor down...

154
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,824
...and the Knicks.

155
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,267
- Maybe I can teach you a few things.
- And vice versa!

156
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,504
It's 10 seconds left.
Pass, you motherfucker!

157
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,635
We need to penetrate, drive to the basket.

158
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,704
Get it to Johnson. He's on fire tonight.
Go L.J., go!

159
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,243
Go! Score!

160
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:52,046
Which is exactly
what Samantha did two hours later.

161
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,134
When I got home that night, I couldn't get
charlotte's words out of my head.

162
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,735
We spent our childhoods playing games.

163
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,103
Were they all just primers
for the games we played as adults?

164
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:13,339
Were relationships just a big chess match:
Strategy moves, countermoves...

165
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,973
...all designed to keep your opponent
off balance until you win?

166
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,109
Was there such a thing as
an honest relationship?

167
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,777
Or was it true?

168
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,446
Do you have to play games to
make a relationship work?

169
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,354
I went out with this girl on Saturday night.
We had a great time.

170
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,693
I didn't call her again until Thursday,
so I didn't seem eager.

171
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,865
I went out with this guy on Saturday night.
I thought we had a great time.

172
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,403
The asshole doesn't call me until Thursday.

173
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,066
I screened his call
and didn't return it until Monday.

174
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,037
I gave my boyfriend an ultimatum.
Propose by Christmas or it's over.

175
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,477
My girlfriends said that was a game.
I think it was just smart.

176
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,450
Besides, if he doesn't come through,
I can always secretly get pregnant.

177
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:58,247
The next day, I reluctantly showed up
for my second appointment with Dr. G.

178
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,191
I was still a skeptic and I'd already read
every New Yorker in the waiting room.

179
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,355
When you think about it,
what was I getting out of this anyway?

180
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,666
And then, at five minutes
to my last scheduled hour...

181
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,203
...I got my answer.

182
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,203
My third appointment with Dr. G:

183
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,375
I had come a little early
to catch up on my reading.

184
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,983
Hi. I'm Seth.

185
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,796
Hi. Carrie.

186
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,731
I thought we could go on playing
this coy game, or I could introduce myself.

187
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,131
Well, I'm glad you did.

188
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,339
Especially since I had worn
my new dress for the occasion.

189
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,434
That New Yorker is from last year.

190
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,441
Well, this New Yorker is
a little behind on her reading.

191
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,644
So, how long you been a Dr. G convert?

192
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,881
Not very long, just three sessions.

193
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,757
I just had my one-year anniversary.

194
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,119
What'd she give you, a cake or something?

195
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,520
A really big bill.

196
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,056
Listen, this is gonna sound a little weird.

197
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,095
Would you have dinner with me sometime?

198
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,004
Sure.

199
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,768
I'd like that.

200
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,439
- Call me, all right?
- Okay.

201
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,147
Maybe it was unethical making a date...

202
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,552
...with Seth Robinson, photographer,
in my shrink's waiting room...

203
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,983
...but there was something about him.

204
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,048
Come on in.

205
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,029
Well, you're dressed up.

206
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,696
He's a photographer.

207
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:53,070
- And you met him at your shrink's?
- It wasn't a setup or anything.

208
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,230
Jeez, what if he's crazy?

209
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,105
It's the crazy ones that have the good pills.

210
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,112
That's it! Go, Marcus! Go!

211
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,444
Excuse me,
but why is that on and who is Marcus?

212
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,076
Marcus Camby, Knicks forward.

213
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,849
Now that Ewing is injured,
he needs to pull it out.

214
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,082
When did we start caring about basketball?

215
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,690
Don is obsessed.
I don't get laid unless the Knicks win.

216
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:17,854
Can I just say?

217
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,626
They and I have been
on a very long losing streak.

218
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,291
- That's awful.
- No kidding.

219
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,928
The Knicks are the only ones
getting screwed.

220
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,995
Come on, you fuckers!

221
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,697
Why are you staying with him?

222
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:33,768
Because the sex, what I can remember,
was unbelievable.

223
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,012
Yes!

224
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,016
They won!

225
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,587
- I've got to go.
- Go.

226
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,849
Have sex. Go!

227
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,491
The next night,
Miranda got a pleasant surprise.

228
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:02,533
Her date thought it was time they moved
past peek-a-boo to playing doctor.

229
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:20,357
Miranda wanted to play fair,
so she gave him a little tit for tat.

230
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,625
All over town, people were getting lucky.

231
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,756
Seth and I were having
a great first date at the coffee shop.

232
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,063
And what about the plant?

233
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,762
I know.
She always has it in a different place.

234
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,501
Maybe it's some sort of
Dr. G psychological test.

235
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,907
- That's it. It's Where's Waldo.
- Yeah.

236
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,942
And it needs to be watered.

237
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,311
- It's plastic.
- Are you sure?

238
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,941
I touched it.

239
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,881
You touched Dr. G's plant?

240
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,355
I've been going to her over a year.
I got bored.

241
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,157
Then you came along.

242
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,260
- Well, that's sweet.
- No, it's true.

243
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,301
There was something about him. I felt
like I could talk to him about anything.

244
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,100
And in the spirit of psychological health
and not playing games...

245
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,868
...I decided to be honest.

246
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,035
I like you.

247
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,737
I like you, too.

248
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,852
Later that week,
Miranda went shopping for dinner.

249
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,835
Shopping quickly devolved
into a game of hide and seek.

250
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,528
I thought I'd be an adult here
and come over and introduce myself.

251
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,922
Hi.

252
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,357
I'm Miranda.

253
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,690
You know.

254
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,666
Across the airshaft.

255
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:21,275
Yeah, right. You're the girl who lives
above the guy I've been cruising.

256
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,811
Miranda realized she was still playing
with an imaginary friend...

257
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,218
...just like she did when she was five.

258
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,622
The next day, she called her shrink
for an emergency session.

259
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,428
Meanwhile, Sam had decided
she would celebrate...

260
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,795
...the end of the basketball season
and the return of her sex life...

261
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,233
...by watching
the final Knicks game at Don's.

262
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,469
Baby!

263
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,069
In a minute, baby.

264
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,705
The Mets are playing Chicago.

265
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,716
Now that basketball is over,
I can give them my full attention.

266
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,911
They've been playing lousy ball this year.

267
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,817
The idea of lasting
through another sexless season...

268
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,190
...was more than Samantha could take.

269
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,024
So, she forfeited the game.

270
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,126
Meanwhile, I was getting plenty of action.

271
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,432
Seth and I had just come back
from another amazing date.

272
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,567
You want to come in?

273
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,711
I think I already am.

274
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,639
This is great.

275
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:38,846
You have all the classics here:
Clue, Parcheesi, and Twister.

276
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,818
I was the seventh grade Twister champion.

277
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,089
- Is that a challenge?
- Yeah.

278
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,292
All right, buddy. It's go time.

279
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:15,616
- How are you holding up?
- Feeling good, my friend.

280
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,227
Left foot yellow.

281
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,260
I guess that one's mine.

282
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,860
You're in a very compromising position.

283
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,838
I believe I'm in about
20 compromising positions.

284
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,170
I am not gonna lose my concentration.

285
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,325
In no time it was "yellow pants off."

286
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,094
So what do you think Dr. G
would have to say about this?

287
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,162
Very bad.

288
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,395
Bad patients.

289
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,466
I have to tell you.

290
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,233
I'm not really into therapy,
I think it's kind of bullshit.

291
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,081
- I'm telling Dr. G on you.
- No, no!

292
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,610
- Cross your heart.
- Hope to die.

293
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,189
So why are you in therapy, seriously?

294
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,691
I'm really fucked up about women.

295
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,956
After I sleep with them,
I completely lose interest.

296
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,691
What about you? What's your problem?

297
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:34,602
I believe in therapy,
this moment is called "the breakthrough."

298
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,135
I pick the wrong men.

299
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:54,652
Although she'd made some good points,
I stopped seeing Dr. G immediately.

300
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,954
I couldn't risk the humiliation
of running into Seth in the waiting room.

301
