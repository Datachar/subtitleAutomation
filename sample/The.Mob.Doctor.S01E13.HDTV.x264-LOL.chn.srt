黑帮天使 前情提要
<i>Previously onThe Mob Doctor</font>

2
00:00:02,473 --> 00:00:05,282
只要你还在芝加哥，你就欠我的，这就是咱们的协议
<i>As long as you're in Chicago,</i>
<i>I own you. That's the deal.</i>

3
00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:07,042
你在这干吗？
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:07,077 --> 00:00:08,143
是你杀了我爸爸吗？
Did you kill my dad?

5
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:10,980
我发誓不是我干的
I swear to you I did not kill your father.

6
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:12,748
这孙子是谁呀？
Who the hell is this guy?

7
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:13,749
不是孙子，是儿子，爸爸
It's me, dad.

8
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:15,050
你想干吗？
What do you need?

9
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:18,354
我欠诺加莱斯·卡特尔的债
The money I borrowed belongs to the Nogales Cartel.

10
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:19,555
你惹大麻烦了
You're in a lot of trouble.

11
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:21,223
我跟卡特尔说了
I floated the message to the cartel

12
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:22,725
你愿意把卢克的债还上
that you're willing to pay off Luke's debt.

13
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,260
你还有事瞒着我，艾尔
There's something you're not telling me, Al.

14
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:25,861
他们已经开始报复行动了
They've already taken punitive measures.

15
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:27,029
他们雇了一个杀手来杀卢克
They've ordered a hit on Luke.

16
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:34,737
帕拉特尼骗了咱们，卡特尔根本没打算休战
Trapani lied about the cartel.There is no truce.

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,875
帕拉特尼根本就没跟他们说你要还上卢克的债
Trapani never even passed on your offer to pay Luke's debt.

18
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:44,180
如果他们知道你没事先打招呼就杀了他们的手下
If they find out you killed their man

19
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:47,783
这事很快就会难以控制了
without trying to negotiate,this is going to get ugly fast.

20
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:48,818
康斯坦丁在哪？
Where's Constantine?

21
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:54,924
救命！
Help!

22
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:58,928
来人啊！
Somebody, help!

23
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:00,529
救命！
Help!!

24
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:02,731
看着点后边儿，都躲开

28

剩下的你们不用管了

29
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:12,908
他的血压降到87了
He's hypotensive to 87 systolic.

30
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:14,577
血肿扩大，肯定是颈动脉破裂

31
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:16,445
血压降到55了

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,947
得赶紧把动脉包扎起来

33
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:20,382
三，二，一，走你

Be right back.Take over.

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,095
格蕾丝。这是我母亲
- Grace.- It's my mom.

39
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,764
她失血两公升，B型阳性血
She's lost at least 2 liters of blood... B-positive.

40
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,099
周期性昏迷
Recurrent loss of consciousness.

41
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,401
行了，你别管了
All right, stop.

00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:40,302
首先，我们得把她抬到病床上绑好

She got bullet wounds to her chest and thigh.What do you want to order?

交叉备血四个单位，准备手术

49
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,083
星星啊，妈妈-你去洗洗手吧
- Come on, mom.- You need to get cleaned up.

50
00:01:54,117 --> 00:01:56,085
不，我得陪着她-你别跟这裹乱了
- No, I'm not gonna leave her.- You need to go.

51
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,920
警察还想找你了解情况呢

52
00:01:57,954 --> 00:01:59,355
现在，这才是你救你妈妈的方式
Right now,this is how you help your mom.

We need to get him to the I.R.,stent his carotid.

55
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,593
借过，大夫，我们得翻一下床单

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,208

57
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:20,976
包扎吧
Pack the gauze.

58
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:23,546
把手术刀递给我
Scalpel.

59
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:38,127
内特，是我啊
Nate, it's me.

60
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,996
格蕾丝
Grace.

61
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:43,332
有人在面包房开枪
Somebody shot up the bakery.

62
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:46,202
什么？这简直就是大屠杀
What? It was like a fricking massacre.

63
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:50,873
格斯，吉尔，斯塔沃斯全都死了
Gus, Gio, Stavos...They're all dead.

64
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:52,641
你怎么拿着康斯坦丁的手机？
Why are you answering Constantine's phone?

65
00:02:52,676 --> 00:02:56,078
他现在在医院呢，妈妈也在这
He's here at the hospital.So is mom.

66
00:02:56,113 --> 00:02:57,413
妈？
Mom?

67
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:59,348
有人开着车从面包房门口经过
There was a drive-by at the house.

68
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:01,016
他们俩都中枪了
They were both hit.

69
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:03,819
咱妈正要动手术呢，你赶紧过来吧
Mom is going into surgery.You need to get here.

70
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:04,820
我这就去
I'm on my way.

71
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:21,937
德芙琳大夫？
Dr. Devlin?

72
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,072
约克探员
Agent York.

73
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:24,607
令堂的事我很难过
I'm sorry to hear about your mother.

74
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,410
护理人员告诉我
I spoke to the paramedics.

75
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:29,712
枪击发生的时候你在现场，看见凶手了吗？
He said you were there when she was shot. Did you see anything?

76
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:30,946
没有，我当时在屋里
No, I-I was inside.

77
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:33,349
我听见枪声就跑出来了
I heard gunshots,and then I-I raced outside.

78
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:35,351
你有没有听见有车开走的声音
Did you see or hear a car speeding away,

79
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:37,520
或者别的什么能协助调查的线索？

80
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:38,754
没有了，很抱歉我得走了
No, I'm sorry.I need to go.

81
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:41,924
德芙琳大夫，我们认为康斯坦丁
Dr. Devlin, we believe that Constantine Alexander

82
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:42,925
就是他们的袭击目标
was the target.

83
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,293
在他中枪之前一小时
An hour before he was shot,

84
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:46,262
至少有四个他的手下在他的店里被杀
at least four of his men were killed at his workplace.

85
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:48,097
貌似凶手在到处找他
It seems the shooter was looking for him,

86
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,499
而且是他的一个手下人把你家的地址泄露给凶手的
and one of his own men pointed him to your house.

87
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:53,269
我，我真的……
I-I really...

88
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:56,138
我知道你在治疗亚历山大先生的糖尿病
I understand you manage Mr. Alexander's diabetes.

89
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:57,807
对，没错
Yeah, that's right.

90
00:03:57,841 --> 00:03:59,875
他有没有说过在个人或者在生意上
Had he mentioned if anyone had threatened him,

91
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,544
受到什么人的威胁
either personally or professionally?

92
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:04,213
没有
No.

93
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:08,017
我需要你配合我的工作
I need your cooperation here.

94
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:11,687
我们里在一起的时候，我们说的都是
Wh-when we're together, we talk about

95
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:13,255
他的血糖指数和他的饮食
his blood sugar levels and his diet.

96
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,924
就这些
That's it.

97
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,959
你弟弟呢？
What about your brother Nate?

98
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:20,129
他怎么了？
What about him?

99
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:23,199
众所周知康斯坦丁把他收在帐下当小弟
We both know Constantine took Nate under his wing.

100
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:30,639
我妈正在准备做手术
My mother is being prepped for surgery right now.

101
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:32,308
你能别跟这儿烦我吗？
Will you excuse me?

102
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,918

105
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,331
格蕾丝
Grace.

106
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:57,033
你弟弟来了
Your brother's here.

107
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,443
咱妈怎么样了？
How's your mom?

108
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:09,779
哦，输了四个单位的血
Well, they transfused four units,

109
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:11,847
但是血压还是不稳定
but, uh,pressure's still borderline.

110
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:13,849
什么意思？
What does that mean?

111
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:16,686
大夫们正在抢救呢
The doctors are repairing the damage,

112
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,554
但是大出血还是没止住
but the bleeding is still a problem.

113
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:19,855
她有危险吗？
Is she gonna be okay?

114
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,025
我不知道
I don't know.

115
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:31,779
黑帮天使 第一季 第十三集 生或死（本季终）
The Mob Doctor 01x13 Life And Death

116
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,220
嘿
Hey.

117
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:52,489
手术怎么这么长时间，怎么回事？
That took longer than it should have. What happened?

118
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:53,690
要不是你当时在那
I mean,if you hadn't been there,

119
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:54,758
她可能都坚持不了这么久
she probably wouldn't have made it this far.

120
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:56,160
你控制住了她的大出血
You really slowed the blood loss.

121
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:57,828
她还没脱离危险
She's in critical condition.

122
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:59,997
她的股动脉被打穿了
Her femoral artery was punctured.

123
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:02,099
我们修复了骨折和大动脉
We stabilized the fractures and repaired the artery.

124
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:04,168
这很好啊
Well, that all sounds good.

125
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:05,836
是啊，不过这么重的伤
Yeah, it's just, with this kind of injury,

126
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,605
术后24小时都是危险期
the 24 hours after surgery are pretty critical.

127
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,507
在她脱离危险之前我都在医院守着
I'm not leaving the hospital until she's stable.

128
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:11,942
如果你有什么需要就找我
If you need anything, I'm here.

129
00:06:11,977 --> 00:06:13,944
谢谢你
Thank you.

130
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:17,948
你就说这有多讽刺吧？
It's ironic, isn't it?

131
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:18,949
什么呀？
What is?

132
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:21,118
我们正在努力抢救一个
The two of us doing all this work

133
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:25,122
尽人皆知的杀手
to save the life of a known killer.

134
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:26,590
说说吧，怎回事，大夫
Don't hold back, doctor.

135
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:29,259
这个人在监狱里呆了好多年
This man spent years in prison,

136
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:32,930
浪费了成千上万纳税人的钱
cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.

137
00:06:32,964 --> 00:06:35,099
现在他出狱了，谁知道他在搞什么勾当呢？
Now that he's out, who knows what he's up to?

138
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:38,602
我猜他肯定不会是卖圣经的
My guess...he's not selling bibles.

139
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:41,438
康斯坦丁·亚历山大是我们的病人
Constantine Alexander is our patient,

140
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:42,940
他现在处于病危状态
and he's in critical condition.

141
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:45,609
我们的职责是把他救活
Our job is to get him out of it alive.

142
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:47,611
废话，我又没说不救
Of course.I wasn't suggesting otherwise.

143
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:50,981
我只是就事论事
I was merely pondering the reality...

144
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:52,082
积点口德吧
Watch your catheter.

145
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:53,484
别给自己找麻烦
You don't want to break through the wall.

146
00:06:53,518 --> 00:06:54,852
就是这儿
It's in position.

147
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:57,154
展开扩充器
Deploying the stent.

148
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:03,160
行了，支架已经安好了
All right.Stent's in good position.

149
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:04,395
出血止住了
Bleeding is stopped.

150
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:06,563
当然了，我止不住老去想
Of course,I can't help but wonder

151
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:09,800
他的枪伤对我们医院整体形象的影响
how his shooting reflects on our hospital.

152
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,135
你什么意思？
Excuse me?

153
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,903
你知道他是在哪挨的枪子么？
Our patient was found

154
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:15,906
德芙琳大夫的家门口
shot on the doorstep of Dr. Devlin's home.

155
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,575
我没必要跟你说这些
I don't have to spell it out for you.

156
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,244
是啊，没必要
No, you don't.

157
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:22,947
但是也许你应该
But perhaps you should find a hospital

158
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:25,849
找一家大家都爱传八卦的医院去工作
where the doctors are more to your liking.

159
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:28,852
现在这事大伙都议论开了
I'm just saying what everyone else is thinking.

160
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:32,356
那你就不要在瞎传这事了
And I think you've done enough pondering for the day.

161
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:38,829
是诺拉加斯·卡特尔的人干的吗？
The Nogales Cartel...that's who shot mom?

162
00:07:38,863 --> 00:07:40,664
我觉得是
I think so.

163
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,601
老康打死了来刺杀卢克的杀手
Constantine killed their guy after he came after Luke.

164
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:46,704
卢克？-老康的儿子
- Luke?- Constantine's son.

165
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:49,873
是么
Right.

166
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:51,942
所以这是在报复老康？
So going after Constantine was payback?

167
00:07:51,976 --> 00:07:53,410
看样子是
Looks like it.

168
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:56,313
老康到咱家来干吗？你知道吗？
Constantine stopped by our house. Do you know why?

169
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,683
行了，你得离开这
All right, you got to stay away from him.

170
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,787
刚才有个FBI特工来过
An FBI agent was just here

171
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:05,789
问起他的事
asking me questions about him,

172
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:07,291
而且他还问我关于你的情况
and then he asked me about you.

173
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:09,793
我？
Me?

174
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:11,528
他们盯上了老康的组织
Yeah, they're keep tabs on his organization,

175
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:13,197
这里还包括咱俩
including me and you.

176
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,132
格蕾丝
Grace.

177
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,901
她怎么样了？
How's she doing?

178
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:19,436
没什么变化
The same.

179
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:20,971
康斯坦丁检查完了
Constantine made it through I.R.

180
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:22,640
现在准备去做手术了
He's being prepped for the O.R. now.

181
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:24,608
谢谢
Thanks.

182
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:26,277
要是她醒过来或者有任何别的事
You text me if anything changes...

183
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:28,112
你就呼我
If she wakes up, anything?

184
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:40,557
你妈怎么样了？
Is your mom okay?

185
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:46,230
我想参加亚历山大的手术
I'd like to scrub in on Mr. Alexander.

186
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:47,798
怀特医生，我不能袖手旁观
Dr. White,I can't just do nothing.

187
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:50,501
我理解
I understand.

188
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:52,436
但是今天不行，格蕾丝
But not today, Grace.

189
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:55,906
这个人是在你们家门口被开枪打伤的
This man was shot on your doorstep.

190
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:58,075
你们俩还认识
You two know each other.

191
00:08:58,109 --> 00:08:59,944
我是他的私人医生
I'm his doctor.

192
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:02,246
他的私人医生？
His doctor?

193
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,181
我负责治疗他的糖尿病
I treat his diabetes.

194
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:05,382
所以我觉得
It only makes sense that

195
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,184
我参与他的手术比较合理
I'm involved in his treatment here.

196
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:11,055
就算是我同意了，虽然我并不打算同意
Only if I were to okay it,which I'm not gonna do.

197
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:14,825
你觉得我对你总是神秘消失
You think I don't notice

198
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:17,161
还有你的特殊病人
all your mysterious disappearances

199
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:22,099
会没有察觉吗？
and your unusual patients?

200
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,708
我那是因为关心你，
I turn a blind eye because I care about you

201
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:34,812
才会睁一只眼闭一只眼不闻不问的
and it was easier not to ask questions.

202
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:39,183
现在你这些事全院都知道了
Now that your life has so publicly

203
00:09:39,217 --> 00:09:42,987
谣言满天飞
found its way into my hospital, my O.R.,

204
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,322
我就再也不能让你再参加手术了
I can't allow it.

205
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:46,423
让你再参加手术了
Not anymore.

206
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,928
康斯坦丁·亚历山大是我的病人
Constantine Alexander is my patient.

207
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:52,162
你不要插手
You'll stay away from him.

208
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,186
我听说令堂有好转了
I heard your mother's in recovery.

209
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,954
真是个好消息
That's great news.

210
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:19,557
你谁呀？
Thanks?

211
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:26,363
内特，你和我都想
Nate, you and I want the same thing...

212
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:28,465
抓住杀害你妈妈的凶手
To catch whoever shot your mom.

213
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,068
杀手可能和射杀康斯坦丁手下的那些人
It's probably the same person or persons

214
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:33,771
是同一拨人
who shot up Constantine Alexander's place.

215
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:35,272
你有什么线索吗？
Do you have any leads?

216
00:10:35,307 --> 00:10:38,042
从这两个枪击案现场收集的子弹
The bullets we recovered from both crime scenes

217
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:40,744
都是军用阿奎拉9毫米口径的
are Aguila 9mm from Centurion Arms.

218
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:43,080
你知道谁会用这种枪吗？
You know who uses those?

219
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:44,248
不知道
No idea.

220
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:45,950
诺加莱斯·卡特尔
The Nogales Cartel.

221
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:48,052
从来没听说过
I never heard of them.

222
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:51,221
内特，我知道你为康斯坦丁工作
Nate, I know you work for Constantine.

223
00:10:51,256 --> 00:10:53,557
绑架，保险诈骗
The blackmail, insurance scams,

224
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:56,961
勒索比尔森街上的酒吧
the extortion of the bars on Pilsen Street.

225
00:10:56,995 --> 00:11:00,264
是啊，我听说你已经盯上我了
Yeah, I heard you were keeping tabs on me.

226
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:02,199
你听说？谁告诉你的？
You heard that? From who?

227
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,438
这不重要，你那些指控没有任何证据
It doesn't matter. You can't prove anything.

228
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:09,273
实际上，我有证据
Actually, I can.

229
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:14,011
这些指控都加起来够你坐20年牢的了
And it all adds up...20 years behind bars.

230
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:22,319
如果你能协助调查
If you help me with this investigation,

231
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:25,322
那些事我就全当不存在
it all goes away.

232
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:27,258
好好想想吧
Think about it.

233
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,004
格蕾丝，我一听到消息就赶过来了
Grace, I came soon as I heard.

234
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:42,173
你妈怎么样了？
How's your mom?

235
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,674
哦，她正在恢复中
Uh, she's in recovery.

236
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,142
老康头儿呢？
And Constantine?

237
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:46,810
正做手术呢
Surgery.

238
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:48,612
别担心，他会挺过来的
Don't you worry.He's gonna pull through.

239
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:52,750
他是条硬汉，我认识的人里命最硬的
He's a real tough guy. The toughest guy I know.

240
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:57,254
这点你比谁都清楚对吧？
But you know that better than anyone, huh?

241
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:58,823
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

242
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:03,160
没事，格蕾丝，我知道他对你都干了些什么
It's okay, Grace.I know what he did for you.

243
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:05,529
等会，你说什么，他对我做什么了？
Sorry? What...What he did for me?

244
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:08,999
在你小时候保护你和你妈妈
To protect you and your mom when you were a kid.

245
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:11,669
康斯坦丁做事的时候我在场
I was there when Constantine took care of business...

246
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:12,937
又快又坚决
Quick, decisive.

247
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:15,606
你那游手好闲的爸爸根本就没想到
Your deadbeat dad never saw it coming.

248
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,210
如果你问我，后来他怎么对待你们的
If you ask me,after what he did to you guys,

249
00:12:19,244 --> 00:12:20,978
我觉得是他运气太差了
I think he got off lucky.

250
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:23,981
你要坚定信念
You just keep the faith, Grace.

251
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:25,950
老康不会有事的
Constantine will be fine.

252
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:27,218
我回头再打给你好吧
I'll call you later, huh?

253
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:39,146
我只不过是个护士，我怎么知道枪击案的事儿呢？
I just work here. How would I know anything about the shooting?

254
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:41,158
你是德芙琳大夫的朋友
You're friends with Dr. Devlin.

255
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,660
我这人朋友就是多
I have a lot of friends.

256
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:44,728
好吧，我没什么朋友
Actually, I don't,

257
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,996
不过我觉得无所谓吧
but that doesn't really matter here.

258
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,332
听着
Look...

259
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:50,334
我知道格蕾丝是个好人
I know Grace is a good person

260
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,336
而且她仅仅与黑帮的边缘人物有关联
and she's only involved with the outfit on the periphery.

261
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,639
但是现在，她却犯糊涂了
But right now, she's not thinking clearly.

262
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:57,708
作为她的朋友，劝劝她回头是岸
As a friend,tell her to talk to me.

263
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,701
我为什么要这么做？
Why would I do that?

264
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,247
因为我即能保护她，也能把她抓起来
Because I can protect her or I can prosecute her.

265
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:07,684
金特罗小姐，帮我劝劝你的朋友吧
Ms. Quintero,help me help your friend.

266
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:12,089
我得回去干活去了
I got to get back to work.

267
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:16,059
还有一个事儿
Just one more question...

268
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:18,662
你知不知道格蕾丝和佛朗哥·里昂的事？
What can you tell me about Grace and Franco Leoni?

269
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:21,031
没什么可说的，他们俩都分手一年多了
There's nothing to tell.They broke up years ago.

270
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:23,333
这么说他们俩还好过
So they used to date.

271
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,504
感谢你的配合 
The bureau appreciates your cooperation.

272
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,085
格蕾丝，我觉得我闯祸了
Grace, I think I screwed up.

273
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:19,757
FBI的人套我话
That FBI guy cornered me

274
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,358
问了我好多关于你的问题
and asked me a bunch of questions about you.

275
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:23,060
你都说什么了？
What did you say?

276
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:26,029
我提到你跟佛朗哥好过
I kind of mentioned you and Franco used to date.

277
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:29,166
话赶话我就被绕进去了，真对不起
He caught me off guard.I'm so sorry.

278
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:33,570
听着，嗯
Look, um...

279
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:37,241
甭管我出什么事了我都爱你
Whatever happens to me,just know that I love you

280
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:39,510
而且我从来都不会
and I-I never meant to

281
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:40,611
怀疑我们的友情
take your friendship for granted.

282
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:43,347
求你了，别这么说呀
Please, please,don't talk like that.

283
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:46,717
康斯坦丁还没出手术室呢？
Is Constantine out of surgery yet?

284
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:48,986
出来了，都一个多小时了，怎么了？
Yeah, about an hour ago.Why?

285
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,754
我得跟他谈谈
I-I just need to talk to him.

286
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,656
这是你现在最明智的选择吗？
Is that the smartest thing for you right now?

287
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,525
可能不是
Probably not.

288
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,063
朝我开枪的这个
The men who did this to me,

289
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,399
杀死我朋友的这个残酷杀手
the ones that murdered my friends in cold blood...

290
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,435
早晚会付出代价的
They're gonna pay for this.

291
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:10,240
这都是因为我
This all happened because of me.

292
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:11,909
对不起
I'm so sorry.

293
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:14,578
不用自责
Don't blame yourself.

294
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:18,449
你是我儿子，要是再碰上这种事我还会这么做的
You're my son,and I would do it again.

295
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:20,951
过来，我跟你说点儿事儿
Come here.I want to tell you something.

296
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,955
格蕾丝
Grace.

297
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,660
嘿
Hi.

298
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,497
你是格蕾丝·德芙琳
You're Grace Devlin.

299
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,333
我是卢克
I'm Luke.

300
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,669
见到你很高兴
Nice to meet you.

301
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:42,206
哦，我能跟老康单独谈谈吗？
Uh, may I talk to Constantine alone?

302
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,980
令堂没事了吧？
So, is your mother all right?

303
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:52,516
她还没脱离危险
She's in critical condition.

304
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,685
别担心，她能挺过来
Don't worry...she's gonna pull through this.

305
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:57,621
她是个坚强的女人，相信我
She's a strong woman.Trust me.

306
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:00,124
为什么这么说，你是永远都这么有把握吗？
Why, 'cause you've always been so trustworthy?

307
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:02,693
你什么意思？
What does that mean?

308
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:05,529
你知道，我爸爸是个酒鬼
You know, my father was an abusive drunk.

309
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:08,365
他毁了我的家庭
He destroyed my family.

310
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,568
然后你现在比他还要变本加厉地来害我
And you have managed to hurt me more than he ever did.

311
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,704
你不能这么说，格蕾丝
You can't mean that, Grace.

312
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:16,373
艾尔·特拉帕尼刚才来了，他以为我知道呢
Al Trapani just came by.He thought I knew.

313
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,709
他说当时他就在旁边看着
He told me he was there when you did it.

314
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:19,877
看着什么？
When I did what?

315
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:21,345
看着你杀死我爸爸！
When you killed my father.

316
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:24,882
然后你就信了？
And you believe him?

317
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:29,520
你就装吧
Just for once be the man you pretend to be.

318
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:32,523
都说出来吧
Spit it out.

319
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:34,658
想说什么就都说出来吧
I mean, you got something to say, just get it out.

320
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:37,027
我六岁的时候看见你的车从我家门口开过去
I was 6 years old when I saw your car pull away,

321
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:39,196
我努力说服自己那不是你
and I convinced myself that it wasn't you.

322
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:42,766
你说这些都不对，格蕾丝
You got it all wrong, Grace.

323
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,936
我的天，别说了，别说了
Oh, my God. Stop it.Just stop.

324
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,707
我没有杀你的父亲，我也没法杀
I didn't kill your father.I couldn't have.

325
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:52,409
但是为什么？
And why is that?

326
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,779
实际上，你知道为什么
Deep down, you know why.

327
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:59,783
你妈妈永远都不想让你知道
Your mother,she never wanted you to know,

328
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,386
也许她有她的理由
maybe with good reason.

329
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,724
但是不管你爱我还是恨我
But love me or hate me,

330
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,559
我都是你的爸爸
I'm your father.

331
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:10,728
这就是为什么她不告诉你
That's the reason why

332
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,396
我昨天晚上去找你
I was at your house last night...

333
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,598
就是想告诉你这个事
To finally tell you.

334
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:25,209
亚历山大先生，你感觉怎么样？
Mr. Alexander...how are you feeling?

335
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:28,545
好多了，大夫
Better, doc.

336
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,282
德芙琳大夫，你在这干吗？
Dr. Devlin,why are you here?

337
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:39,289
他的手机，哦，落在急诊室了
His phone, um,dropped in the E.R.

338
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,158
我过来把手机给他
I was just returning it.

339
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:44,261
然后说再见
And saying goodbye.

340
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:53,061
啊
Ah.

341
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:54,432
妈
Ma.

342
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:56,088
妈Ma.

343
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:59,288
嘿
Hi.

344
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:01,718
嘿
Hey.

345
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:03,945
嘿，格蕾丝
Hey, Grace.

346
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:07,281
嗯
Hmm.

347
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:08,916
你感觉怎么样？
How you feeling?

348
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:12,754
我好多了，但是
I've been better, but...

349
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:14,255
我是个幸存者，知道吗
I'm a survivor...You know that.

350
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:27,401
妈-啊？
- Ma.- Huh?

351
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:29,904
康斯坦丁刚才跟我说了
Constantine just told me something...

352
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:38,046
关于你和他，还有我
About you and him...and me.

353
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,216
哦？
Oh?

354
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:46,621
他跟我说……
He told me that...

355
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:52,727
他跟我说他是我爸爸
He told me that he's my father.

356
00:18:54,196 --> 00:18:57,698
是么，我觉得他肯定是被枪打坏了脑袋
Yeah, right. I mean, he probably hit his head when he got shot.

357
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:09,110
别骗我了-那不是真的
Come on.That's not true.

358
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:13,484
那是我跟艾伦结婚两年之后
I was married to Alan for two years.

359
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:19,110
他很粗鲁，我当时觉得很孤独
He was very cruel,and I was so lonely.

360
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:22,357
但是……
But...

361
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:25,860
当我发现我已经怀了你之后……
When I found out I was pregnant with you...

362
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:27,962
你骗了我爸？
You lied to dad?

363
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:29,397
我必须得瞒着他，不然他会把我们都杀了
I had to, Nate.He would have killed us.

364
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:31,332
你知道的
You know that.

365
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:35,470
他都死了好几年了，妈妈，你为什么后来不告诉我们？
He died years ago, mom.Why didn't you tell us after?

366
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:40,809
这种事怎么说呀？
H-how do you t-tell somebody something like that?

367
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,411
我不想伤害你，格蕾丝
I didn't want to hurt you, Grace.

368
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:47,916
你知道，当我发现他死了
You know,when I found him dead,

369
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,617
我，
I, uh...

370
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:54,189
我觉得是我的错
I thought something was wrong with me.

371
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:57,892
我是说，哪个六岁的女孩会希望
I mean,what 6-year-old girl is glad

372
00:19:57,927 --> 00:19:59,727
自己的爸爸被谋杀呢？
when their father is murdered?

373
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:01,196
什么？
What?

374
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,665
然后现在我又发现，他根本就不是我的爸爸
And now I find out he's not even my dad.

375
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:05,366
哦，格蕾丝
Oh, Grace.

376
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:09,571
抱歉，我得出去待会
I'm sorry.I'm just gonna get some air.

377
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:11,639
我太……
I'm so...

378
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:16,578
格蕾丝，我太对不起你了
Grace, I'm so sorry.

379
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:23,118
你干得很棒，你就了我的命
Did a great job, doc.You saved my life.

380
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:25,286
我得伤怎么样？
So, how's it look?

381
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:29,457
颈动脉功能恢复了
The carotid stent is functional.

382
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:33,294
几个星期之后就能出院了
You should be out of here in a couple weeks.

383
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:42,937
我想跟你谈谈关于德芙琳大夫的事
I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Devlin.

384
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:46,374
好哇，说吧
Sure. Go ahead.

385
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:52,080
你会毁了她的事业的，或者比这更糟
You're gonna ruin her career... or worse.

386
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,921
我知道你是谁，也知道你是干什么的
I know who you are,I-I know what you do,

387
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:05,393
而且我也知道你接下来的……计划
and I-I know about your...arrangement.

388
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:08,062
这么说你知道我是谁
So you know who I am,

389
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:09,998
然后你就这么跟我说话？
and yet you talk to me like this?

390
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,070
你很关心格蕾丝对吗？
You care about Grace,don't you?

391
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:18,239
是啊，不用担心她，大夫
Well, don't worry about her, doc.

392
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:20,375
我不会让她出任何事的
I'm not gonna let anything happen to her.

393
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:22,043
最好的办法是
The only way that works

394
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:24,746
你离她远远的
is if you leave her the hell alone.

395
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,588
我待会再来给你检查
I'll be back to check on you later.

396
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:46,634
你好哇？
Hello?

397
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,970
格蕾丝？哦，谢天谢地
Grace? Oh, thank God.

398
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:50,972
弗朗哥，我以为你说……
Franco, I thought you said

399
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:52,474
咱俩这么打电话不太安全
it wasn't safe for us to contact each other.

400
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:54,142
没事，这是一次性的电话
Uh, it's a disposable phone.

401
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:56,845
我从新闻上听说汽车枪击案的事了
I heard about the drive-by.It's all over the news.

402
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:59,481
是啊，我妈和老康都中枪了，但是他们没死
Yeah, my mom and Constantine were hit, but they're alive.

403
00:21:59,515 --> 00:22:00,782
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

404
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:02,350
我没受伤
I'm not hurt.

405
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:05,954
我不是这个意思，我是说，你没事吧？
That's not what I'm asking. Are you okay?

406
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:09,757
我有事
Not really.

407
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,793
听着，我想告诉你
Look, there's something you need to know.

408
00:22:11,827 --> 00:22:13,128
约克探员来过了
Agent York was here,

409
00:22:13,162 --> 00:22:14,629
绕世界打听
and he's been questioning everybody.

410
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:16,598
小罗告诉他咱俩好过
And Ro let it slip that we used to date.

411
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,766
这下糟了
That's not good.

412
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:21,369
你还能为我抵挡多久？
How long before he figures out you've been covering for me?

413
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:24,372
好吧，听我说，好吗？
All right, listen to me,all right?

414
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:25,473
现在，如果他再去找你
Now, if he comes to you,

415
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:27,175
你不能让他发现你在撒谎
you can't let him catch you in a lie.

416
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:31,513
你还记得那最有力的三个字吗？
You got to remember the three most powerful words...

417
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:32,680
不知道（我还以为是“我爱你”呢——译者注）
"I don't know."

418
00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:35,850
说出来
Say it.

419
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:37,352
我不知道
I don't know.

420
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:39,054
很好
Good.

421
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,391
我顶不了多久
I can't handle this.

422
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:44,893
你能行
Yes, you can.

423
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:46,061
你肯定能行
Yes, you can, you just got to

424
00:22:46,095 --> 00:22:48,463
只要过了今天就没事了，好吗？
focus on getting through today,all right?

425
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:50,965
好吧
Okay.

426
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,302
我想你了
I miss you.

427
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:59,307
我也想你
I miss you, too.

428
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,691
你早就应该告诉我这些事
I should know these things.

429
00:23:16,725 --> 00:23:18,860
我不想让这些事
I don't want any of this to change

430
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:22,630
改变你对我和格蕾丝的看法
the way you feel about me...about Grace.

431
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,669
可是阿兰是我爸爸对么？
Alan was my dad, though, right?

432
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:30,305
当然了
Of course he was.

433
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:32,957
哦
Oh.

434
00:23:38,614 --> 00:23:41,549
我原谅你了
I forgive you.

435
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:45,420
格蕾丝也会原谅你的，不过得等她疯完了再说
And Grace will, too,when she's done freaking out.

436
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:53,394
行了，我去找找格蕾丝，顺便安慰安慰她
All right, I'm gonna go find Grace and calm her down.

437
00:23:56,432 --> 00:23:58,900
妈？妈！你怎么了？
Mom? Mom! Mom, are you okay?

438
00:23:58,934 --> 00:23:59,968
快叫医生来！快呀！救命啊！
Get a doctor!Help! Help!

439
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:02,237
来人啊，我妈快不行了！救命啊！
Someone, I need help!My mom needs help!

440
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:12,947
格蕾丝，你刚才上哪去了？
Grace, where have you been?!

441
00:24:12,982 --> 00:24:14,949
他们把你妈的危险警报上升到蓝色了
They paged a code blue on your mom.

442
00:24:14,984 --> 00:24:17,786
正在抢救呢
They're working on her now.

443
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,788
妈！
Mom!

444
00:24:19,822 --> 00:24:21,456
把电击器给我。格蕾丝，别这样
Give me the paddles.Grace, stop.

445
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,825
我需要两安培的重碳酸盐。把电击器给我！
I need two amps of bicarb.Give me the paddles!

446
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:25,560
嘿，你要是给她做电击的话
Hey, she went from v-fib to asystole

447
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:26,728
她就会从心律失常到心脏停搏，然后再也不会有心跳了
and never had a rhythm after that.

448
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:27,729
你试过抗利尿激素了吗？
Did you try vasopressin?

449
00:24:27,763 --> 00:24:30,732
她的脂肪栓塞没有疏通
She threw a lipid embolism.

450
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:33,368
我们一点办法都没有
There was nothing we could do.

451
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:40,442
太对不起了
I'm really sorry.

452
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:41,609
她死了
She's gone.

453
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:05,615
嘿
Hey.

454
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,591
我正找你呢
I've been looking for you.

455
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:25,034
我们当时正在聊天呢
We were just... talking.

456
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:28,871
然后……
And then...

457
00:25:28,906 --> 00:25:31,074
就什么都完了
Out of nowhere...

458
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:43,519
有时候，当一根长骨头被砸碎了
Sometimes,when a long bone shatters,

459
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:46,856
它，哦
it, uh...

460
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:51,861
很多碎骨头片就会扩散到全身
It showers pieces of the marrow throughout the body.

461
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:55,031
有一片骨头就留在她的肺部
And one of those pieces got lodged in her lung.

462
00:25:55,065 --> 00:25:58,101
这么说是他的医生搞砸了
So her doctors screwed up.

463
00:25:58,135 --> 00:26:00,236
不是，只是这种事没那么容易预测，你知道吗？
No. It's just not that easy to predict, you know?

464
00:26:00,271 --> 00:26:03,406
这就是为什么术后24小时是最关键的时间
That's why the 24 hours after surgery are so critical.

465
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,408
天呐，格蕾丝
God, Grace.

466
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:07,110
别说了
Shut up.

467
00:26:07,144 --> 00:26:10,647
妈妈死了
Mom's dead.

468
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:29,299
内特
Nate...

469
00:26:32,202 --> 00:26:35,611
我曾经对她恶语相向
The things I said to her were really ugly.

470
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,946
她临死之前都觉得我在恨他
And she died thinking that I hated her.

471
00:26:51,355 --> 00:26:54,157
格蕾丝……妈妈知道你爱她
Grace...mom knew you loved her.

472
00:26:54,191 --> 00:26:57,160
在妈妈临死之前
That's... that's what we were talking about,

473
00:26:57,194 --> 00:26:59,095
我就是这么跟她说的
right before...

474
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:01,598
她知道你爱她，我保证她知道
She knew.I promise you... she knew.

475
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:03,132
我只是去照顾她
I just went after her.

476
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,634
你知道，我根本没想那么多
You know,I didn't think about it.

477
00:27:04,668 --> 00:27:06,135
我当时太生气了
I just was so mad.

478
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,072
你有理由生气
You had a right to be angry.

479
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:20,750
我并不是生妈妈的气
I'm not angry at ma, though.

480
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:26,589
有些事我必须去做，知道吗？
There's something I have to do, okay?

481
00:27:44,408 --> 00:27:47,043
格蕾丝
Grace...

482
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:51,314
你妈妈的事我感到很难过
I'm so sorry to hear about your mother.

483
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:53,616
我最不愿看到的
The last thing I would have ever wanted

484
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:56,986
就是丹妮拉受到伤害
was for Daniella to get hurt.

485
00:27:57,021 --> 00:28:00,456
但她死了
Well, she was.

486
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:02,982
而且所有的这一切
And all of it,

487
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:07,363
这些牺牲，这些尸体
the blood and the...the bodies,

488
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:09,199
都是你造成的
it all goes back to you.

489
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:11,534
别这么说，求你，听我说
Don't do this.Please, just listen.

490
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:15,204
我试图让自己相信，你还是有好的一面
I let myself believe there was something good in you,

491
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:17,206
但是我错了
and I was wrong.

492
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:23,680
我要把我知道的所有事都告诉FBI
I'm gonna tell the FBI everything I know.

493
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,184
我无所谓，一切都结束了
I just don't care.It's over.

494
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:29,852
好吧
Fine.

495
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:32,922
如果你想这么干，我不会阻拦你的
I won't stop you if that's what you want to do.

496
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:37,227
但是斯塔沃斯昨天给我发了个短信
But just know Stavos left me this message yesterday.

497
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:39,729
你要是不把手机还给我，我就不知道他说了什么
I didn't get it until you gave me my phone.

498
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:40,763
听着
Listen.

499
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:42,565
我们有麻烦了
<i>We have a problem.</i>

500
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,570
特拉帕尼骗了拉特尔，他们根本就没打算休战
<i>Trapani lied about the cartel.</i>
<i>There is no truce.</i>

501
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:51,074
特拉帕尼从来没把你的想还清卢克欠款的事告诉他
<i>Trapani never even passed on your offer to pay Luke's debt.</i>

502
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:52,475
如果他们发现
<i>If they find out</i>

503
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:54,544
你没实现商量就杀了他的手下
<i>you killed their man without trying to negotiate,</i>

504
00:28:54,578 --> 00:28:56,713
这件事很快就会升级
<i>this is going to get ugly fast.</i>

505
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:02,051
他给我发这条信息一个小时之后
An hour after he sent me this message,

506
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:06,723
他和我半个帮派的成员都被枪杀了
he and half my crew were gunned down... executed.

507
00:29:06,757 --> 00:29:09,759
是特拉帕尼陷害了我
It was Trapani who set me up.

508
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:11,761
他根本就没跟卡特尔交涉
He didn't negotiate with the cartel.

509
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:13,196
杀手是他派来的
He sent the cartel.

510
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,197
他为什么要这么干？
Why would he do that?

511
00:29:14,231 --> 00:29:15,431
你说为什么？
Why do you think?

512
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:18,768
他看到了一个夺权的机会，而且他付诸行动了
He saw an opportunity to seize power, and he took it.

513
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:21,404
你知道为什么他跟你说我的事吗？
Why do you think he told you about me?

514
00:29:21,438 --> 00:29:24,907
就是想挑拨我们之间的关系
Trying to drive a wedge between us.

515
00:29:24,942 --> 00:29:29,579
格蕾丝，卡特尔的手下也许扣动了扳机
Grace, the cartel may have pulled the trigger,

516
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:32,081
但为你母亲的死负责的是艾尔特拉帕尼
but Al Trapani is the one who's responsible

517
00:29:32,116 --> 00:29:33,616
应该是艾尔·特拉帕尼
for your mother's murder.

518
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:37,320
如果你想让流血事件停止，如果你想要讨回公道
And if you want the bloodshed to end and you want justice,

519
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:39,889
那么我们就应该联手把他拿下
then you and me are gonna have to take him down.

520
00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:47,764
我应该怎么做？
What would I have to do?

521
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:50,266
不行，这么做太疯狂了
No way. That's insane.

522
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:53,002
你是唯一一个能绕过艾尔特拉帕尼去跟诺加莱斯·卡特尔说上话的人
You're the only one who can contact the Nogales cartel

523
00:29:53,037 --> 00:29:54,671
去跟诺加莱斯·卡特尔说上话的人
without involving Al Trapani.

524
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:56,339
是啊，当然了，他们一定愿意听我的解释
Yeah, of course they'd like to hear from me,

525
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:58,107
这样他们就可以找到我然后杀了我
so they can find me and kill me.

526
00:29:58,142 --> 00:30:00,443
我只想用你在迈阿密的那些关系
All I'm asking you to do is use your Miami contacts

527
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:03,980
帮我安排一个和迪亚哥·恩里克斯的会面
to set up a meeting between me and Tiago Enriquez.

528
00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:06,483
他是卡特尔在芝加哥的得力助手
He's cartel's lieutenant here in Chicago.

529
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:08,785
你疯了吧，这家为什么要跟你见面呢？
This is crazy. Why do you think this guy will even meet you?

530
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:11,321
因为我是康斯坦丁的代言人
Because I'm authorized to speak for Constantine.

531
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,326
当然我还是他的女儿
'Cause I'm his daughter.

532
00:30:19,555 --> 00:30:21,032
这么说你知道了
So you know.

533
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:30,640
你能帮我吗？
Will you make the call?

534
00:30:30,674 --> 00:30:33,142
我只是一个破产的不动产经纪人
Grace, I'm just a real-estate guy who screwed up.

535
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:35,311
我甚至都不该来芝加哥。我还是个外科医生呢
-I shouldn't even be here.-And I'm a surgeon.

536
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:36,880
这事对咱俩来说都不怎么在行
We're both out of our element.

537
00:30:36,914 --> 00:30:40,450
我求你帮我这个忙
I am asking you to help.

538
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:45,488
我怎么能拒绝我的姐姐呢？
How can I say no to my sister?

539
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:06,543
什么东西？
What's that?

540
00:31:06,577 --> 00:31:08,144
格蕾丝·德芙琳的通话记录
Grace Devlin's phone records.

541
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:12,115
那这干吗？
So?

542
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:14,951
看上去你们俩比我想得还要亲密
Looks like you two are a lot closer than I thought.

543
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:16,953
直到你离开芝加哥一个月之前
Until you left town a month ago,

544
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:18,855
你们俩还每天通好几个电话
you spoke several times a day.

545
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:20,356
电话很频繁啊
The calls are highlighted.

546
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:22,358
她是老康的医生
She's Constantine's doctor.

547
00:31:22,393 --> 00:31:24,394
获取她的信任，就可以从老康那获得情报
I was gaining her trust.She has his ear.

548
00:31:24,428 --> 00:31:26,095
别操你大爷了，弗朗哥
Cut the crap, Franco.

549
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,098
你们俩好上了是吧？
You used to date.Isn't that right?

550
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:30,600
是的，好长时间了
Yeah, a long time ago.

551
00:31:30,634 --> 00:31:31,701
你就一点没跟我提过这事？
You just failed to mention it?

552
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:33,036
我当时还不太确定
It wasn't relevant.

553
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,004
它结束了我的卧底生涯
It ended the day I was recruited.

554
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,541
你有没有告诉她，她被FBI调查了？
You told her she was being investigated, didn't you?

555
00:31:38,576 --> 00:31:41,044
你骗了我，弗朗哥
You lied to me, Franco.

556
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:42,879
她不仅仅是康斯坦丁的医生
She's not just Constantine's doctor.

557
00:31:42,913 --> 00:31:44,180
她受康斯坦丁保护
She's under his thumb,

558
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:46,416
并且帮他做事
and she aided and abetted outfit activity.

559
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:50,753
我不知道
I don't know.

560
00:31:56,327 --> 00:31:58,628
好吧
Okay.

561
00:31:58,662 --> 00:32:00,697
好吧，那就让我告诉你我得到的消息吧
Well, then,let me tell you what I know.

562
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:04,868
我知道你对德芙琳大夫仍然有感情
I know you still got the hots for Dr. Devlin

563
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:08,037
而且我还知道最近又和好了
and I know you two started up again recently.

564
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:10,373
她只是协助我调查而已
She helped me with my investigation. That's it.

565
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:13,376
那你怎么解释犯罪现场鉴定科
Then how do you explain CSU finding her fingerprints

566
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:17,046
在你的藏身处找到很多她的指纹
all over your safe house...

567
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:20,550
要知道，那可是局里在你离开之前
You know, the motel room the bureau set you up in

568
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:22,385
特意为你准备的房间
before you took off?

569
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:25,788
我要把你的事报告给总局领导
I'm reporting you to the Attorney General's office.

570
00:32:25,823 --> 00:32:28,958
他们会提出控告的
They're gonna press charges.

571
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:31,060
把你的枪和警徽给我
I need your gun and your badge.

572
00:32:45,776 --> 00:32:49,712
别再浪费时间去追查格蕾丝了
If you're going after Grace,you're wasting your time.

573
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:54,217
这么不是你说了算的
Well, that's not your call to make.

574
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,868
我去后边的停车场看了，他还没来
I checked the back parking lot.There's no sign of him.

575
00:33:11,902 --> 00:33:13,203
他迟到了
He's late.

576
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:15,214
咱俩都别着急
We're not in a rush.

577
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:18,208
我跟他说咱们要报警的时候
When I told him we wanted to meet at the police station,

578
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:19,842
他挺不高兴的
he didn't seem too happy.

579
00:33:19,877 --> 00:33:22,011
是啊，咱们得先保证自己的安全
Yeah, well, we need to be safe.

580
00:33:22,046 --> 00:33:24,481
你确定他听了斯塔沃斯的留言了吗？
You're sure he listened to Stavos' message?

581
00:33:24,515 --> 00:33:26,483
那就是他同意来这的原因
Yeah, it's the whole reason he agreed to meet.

582
00:33:27,751 --> 00:33:31,921
来了
Here we go.

583
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:41,998
恩里克斯先生，我是格蕾丝·德芙琳
Mr. Enriquez,I'm Grace Devlin.

584
00:33:42,032 --> 00:33:45,502
你是康斯坦丁·亚历山大的女儿？
Constantine Alexander's daughter?

585
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:46,936
对
That's right.

586
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:52,041
这傻逼是他儿子？
And this piece of crap is Constantine's son?

587
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:54,144
对
Yeah.

588
00:33:54,178 --> 00:33:57,313
艾尔·特拉帕尼……
Al Trapani...

589
00:33:57,348 --> 00:34:00,150
貌似我被他设了个套去打康斯坦丁
Seems he played me against Constantine.

590
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:01,918
你爸爸是不是跟我一样生气？
Is your father as pissed off as I am?

591
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:03,353
是的，所以我们才来找你
Yeah, that's why we're here.

592
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:08,024
你觉得我们应该怎么办？
What do you propose we do about it?

593
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:12,529
康斯坦丁不愿和你作对
Constantine is willing to forgo retaliation

594
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:14,164
并且把艾森豪威尔高速路的西边入口
and give you free access to

595
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:16,232
的生意给你
the West Side Eisenhower Expressway.

596
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,233
好几百万呢
It's worth millions.

597
00:34:17,268 --> 00:34:18,568
那不归他管
It's not his to offer.

598
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:21,070
艾尔·特拉帕尼管着高速路呢
Al Trapani controls the expressway.

599
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:23,573
作为交换，你得同意休战
In exchange, you'll agree to a truce

600
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:25,008
还得把卢克的债给免了
and you'll forgive Luke's debt.

601
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:28,044
你可以把这笔账算到特拉帕尼身上去
You'll take the hit off of Luke,and you'll put it on Trapani.

602
00:34:39,156 --> 00:34:41,124
康斯坦丁现在还在医院
And you're telling me Constantine's got enough juice

603
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:44,227
他有那么多精力处理西边的事儿吗？
to take over the West Side from his hospital bed?

604
00:34:44,261 --> 00:34:47,030
他控制着市里大多数议员的选票
Well, he owns enough aldermen to shift city council votes.

605
00:34:47,064 --> 00:34:48,832
他有足够的手下去处理那些
He's got enough soldiers on the street

606
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:50,533
阻挡他生意的人
to crush anyone who won't play ball.

607
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:52,535
而且警察也是他收买好了的
And the CPD will turn a blind eye,

608
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,938
会对这事睁一只眼闭一只眼的
thanks to every cop he's got in his pocket.

609
00:34:54,972 --> 00:34:56,773
如果我同意了
If I agree to this

610
00:34:56,807 --> 00:34:59,275
但是康斯坦丁没挺过来死了
and Constantine doesn't keep up his end,

611
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,910
我们会再回来找你们俩的
we'll come after the both of you.

612
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:03,079
明白了么
You understand?

613
00:35:03,114 --> 00:35:05,582
我跟我爸爸跟你保证据对没问题
You have my father's word and mine.

614
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:08,585
行吧
It's done.

615
00:35:09,787 --> 00:35:11,754
我还没说完呢
Not yet.

616
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:13,623
是你们谁杀的我妈？
Which one of you shot my mother?

617
00:35:20,197 --> 00:35:23,066
现在我说完了
Now we're done.

618
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:40,513
要不要打点胰岛素？
Does the patient need Insulin?

619
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:44,050
不用，他的血糖指数不高，就打点镇静剂就行了
No, his sugar levels are fine.I just gave him a sedative.

620
00:35:44,084 --> 00:35:45,485
我能单独跟他谈谈吗？
Can we have a moment, please?

621
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,520
当然了，大夫
Of course, doctor.

622
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:58,031
怎么了？
So, what happened?

623
00:35:58,065 --> 00:36:02,035
我跟他们说了
It's done.

624
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:03,703
恩里克斯会处理特拉帕尼的
Enriquez will take care of Trapani

625
00:36:03,737 --> 00:36:05,271
代价是高速公路的生意
in exchange for the Expressway,

626
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:06,773
卢克的帐也抹了
and Luke will get a free pass.

627
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:10,443
好
Okay.

628
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:13,613
这能让我们在下一次行动之前
That'll give us the breathing room we need

629
00:36:13,647 --> 00:36:16,249
有个喘息的时间
until we're ready to make our move.

630
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,522
下一次行动是什么意思？
What do you mean,"ready to make our move"?

631
00:36:25,326 --> 00:36:26,960
你觉得呢？
What do you think?

632
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:30,296
你就直接说吧
Why don't you tell me?

633
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:33,132
在枪击案之后，这笔交易会让卡特尔
After the ambush, the cartel...

634
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:35,735
拿走咱们所有的生意
they could have taken everything away from us.

635
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:39,872
我们得让他放松警惕
We had to trick them into a sense of security.

636
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:43,543
所有的战争都是骗局，格蕾丝
All war is deception, Grace.

637
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:47,213
而我们在跟卡特尔的这场战争绝对不能输
And a war with the cartel is one we can't lose.

638
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:52,218
但是我们没输是因为我们还没开始打
But we're not losing 'cause we're not fighting.

639
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,886
这就是咱们的交易
That's the deal we made.

640
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,890
没有交易
There is no deal.

641
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,726
从来就没有交易
There never was a deal.

642
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,230
这全都是手段，是迷惑敌人的
It's all a tactic, an illusion.

643
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:07,433
你利用我？
You used me?

644
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:11,271
你要是知道整个计划就不会帮我做事了
Well, if you knew the plan,you wouldn't have done it.

645
00:37:11,305 --> 00:37:12,939
而且除了你之外，
And there is nobody that could have

646
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:15,875
没有人能完成这件事
pulled this off like you,Grace... nobody.

647
00:37:19,313 --> 00:37:21,281
我一点都不想卷到这件事里边去
I don't want any part of this.

648
00:37:21,315 --> 00:37:25,952
你根本没得选，你还不明白吗？
You don't have a choice.Don't you see?

649
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:31,190
你是我的女儿，咱们是一家人
You're my blood, my family.

650
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:34,961
我什么样你就什么样
What is in me is in you.

651
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:41,167
我困了
I'm tired now.

652
00:37:41,202 --> 00:37:42,769
我得睡会儿
I need to rest.

653
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,143
我会动用我所有的力量来打这一仗的
I'm gonna need all my strength for the fight ahead.

654
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,402
内特
Nate.

655
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,571
格蕾丝
Grace.

656
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:00,240
老康怎样了？他没事吧？
How's Constantine? Is he okay?

657
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:03,009
嗯，他，他没事
Yeah, he's...He's doing good.

658
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:04,310
我能去看看吗？
Can I see him?

659
00:40:04,345 --> 00:40:08,915
哦，他，他现在需要休息
Oh, he's...He needs his rest right now.

660
00:40:13,654 --> 00:40:16,322
我退出
I'm done.

661
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,191
啊？
Yeah?

662
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:21,427
康斯坦丁，他的帮派
Constantine,the organization...

663
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,296
我再也不想跟他们扯上关系了
I don't want anything to do with it anymore.

664
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:30,170
你有什么打算？
What about you?

665
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:36,810
我早就想好了
I made my decision a long time ago.

666
00:40:41,515 --> 00:40:43,950
我爱你
I love you.

667
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,752
我也爱你
I love you, too.
